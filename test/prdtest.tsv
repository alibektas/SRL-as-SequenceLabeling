This  
BuzzMachine  
post V V
argues V V
that  
Google  
's  
rush V V
toward  
ubiquity  
might  
backfire V V
--  
which  
we  
've V V
all  
heard V V
before  
,  
but  
it  
's V V
particularly  
well  
-  
put  
in  
this

Google  
is V V
a  
nice  
search  
engine  
.  

Does V V
anybody  
use V V
it  
for  
anything  
else  
?  

They  
own V V
blogger  
,  
of  
course  
.  

Is V V
that  
a  
money  
maker  
?  

I  
'm V V
staying V V
away  
from  
the  
stock  
.  

I  
doubt V V
the  
very  
few  
who  
actually  
read V V
my  
blog  
have V V
not  
come V V
across V 
this  
yet  
,  
but  
I  
figured V V
I  
would  
put V V
it  
out  
there  
anyways  
.  

John  
Donovan  
from  
Argghhh!  
has V V
put V V
out  
a  
excellent  
slide  
show V V
on  
what  
was V V
actually  
found V V
and  
fought V V
for  
in  
Fallujah

He  
makes V V
some  
good  
observations V V
on  
a  
few  
of  
the  
pic's  
.  

One  
of  
the  
pictures  
shows V V
a  
flag  
that  
was V V
found V V
in  
Fallujah  
.  

On  
the  
next  
two  
pictures  
he  
took V V
screenshots V 
of  
two  
beheading  
video's  
.  

Compare V V
the  
flags  
to  
the  
Fallujah  
one  
.  

You  
have V V
to  
see V V
these  
slides  
....  
they  
are V V
amazing V V
.  

This  
Fallujah  
operation V V
my  
turn V V
out  
to  
be V V
the  
most  
important  
operation V V
done V V
by  
the  
US  
Military  
since  
the  
end V V
of

war V V

Let V V
me  
join V V
the  
chorus V 
of  
annoyance  
over  
Google  
's  
new  
toolbar  
,  
which  
,  
as  
noted V V
in  
the  
linked V 
article  
,  
commits V V
just  
about  
every  
sin  
an  
online  
marketer  
could  
commit V V
,  
and  
makes V V
up  
a  
few  
new  
ones  
besides  
.  

I  
'm V V
not  
fond V V
of  
the  
Google  
-  
hates V V
-  
privacy  
argument V V

(  
You  
do V V
n't  
need V V
to  
use V V
their  
site  
,  
you  
can  
opt V V
-  
out  
of  
sharing V V
your  
information  
,  
you  
do V V
n't  
need V V
to  
send V V
stuff  
to  
anyone  
with  
a  
Gmail  
account  
,  
and  
if  
--  
wonder V 
of  
wonders V 
--  
you  
're V V
worried V V
that  
you  
might  
send V V
something  
to  
someone  
who  
would  
forward V V
an  
excerpt

then  
store V V

you  
have V V
far  
,  
far  
too  
much  
time  
on  
your  
hands  
)  
.  

However  
,  
this  
toolbar  
is V V
really  
bad  
news  
.  

On  
the  
other  
hand  
,  
it  
looks V V
pretty  
cool V V
.  

Iran  
says V V
it  
is V V
creating V V
nuclear  
energy  
without  
wanting V V
nuclear  
weapons  
.  

The  
United  
States  
does V V
n't  
believe V V
the  
Iranian  
Government  
.  

One  
can  
suspect V V
the  
Iranian  
Government  
.  

But  
there  
is V V
no  
proof V 
.  

I  
read V V
an  
Article  
in  
Time  
magazine  
accusing V V
the  
Iranian  
Government  
of  
being V V
willing V V
to  
start V V
a  
nuclear  
war V V
and  
I  
sympathise V V
with  
the  
Article  
.  

They  
are V V
certainly  
being V V
nasty V V
to  
the  
United  
Nations  
Security  
Council  
in  
connection V V
with  
the  
anti-proliferation  
treaty  
.  

The  
President  
has V V
also  
said V V
he  
would  
like V V
to  
see V V
Israel  
wiped V V
off  
the  
map  
which  
he  
could  
n't  
even  
begin V V
to  
try V V
without  
nuclear  
weapons  
.  

But  
he  
has V V
insisted V V
that  
he  
wants V V
nuclear  
power  
for  
peaceful  
purposes  
.  

Many  
people  
want V V
to  
use V V
diplomacy  
with  
Iran  
rather  
than  
military  
pressure  
.  

But  
will  
diplomacy  
work V V
?  

And  
can  
anyone  
use V V
military  
pressure  
without  
proof V V
?  

One  
reader  
pointed V V
out  
that  
the  
President  
watched V V
the  
Americans  
in  
the  
embassy  
when  
they  
took V V
them  
hostage  
.  

He  
has V V
denied V V
this  
.  

We  
do V V
n't  
have V V
to  
believe V V
him  
.  

But  
we  
ca  
n't  
prove V V
it  
.  

It  
does V V
seem V V
that  
Iranians  
frequently  
make V V
statements V V
and  
then  
hide V V
behind  
lack V V
of  
proof V V
.  

Angry  
crowds  
chanted V V
anti-American  
slogans  
in  
the  
western  
city  
of  
Falluja  
(  
pop.  
256,000  
)  
as  
the  
security  
police  
killed V V
in  
a  
friendly  
fire V 
incident  
by  
US  
troops  
were V V
buried V V
on  
Saturday  
.  

Reuters  
reported V V
that  
"  
Sunni  
clerics  
in  
the  
town  
issued V V
a  
'  
Declaration V V
by  
the  
people  
of  
Fallujah  
'  
condemning V V
the  
deaths V V
of  
the  
security  
guards  
and  
police  
,  
announcing V V
three  
days  
of  
mourning  V
,  
and  
calling V V
for  
a  
general  
strike V V
today  
.  
"  

It  
read V V
,  
"  
The  
people  
of  
Fallujah  
condemn V V
the  
massacre  V
which  
was V V
committed V V
on  
Friday  
against  
people  
dedicated  
to  
the  
protection V V
of  
Fallujah  
.  

Let V V
aggressive  
(  
American  
)  
leaders  
and  
soldiers  
know V V
that  
we  
are V V
capable V V
of  
protecting V V
the  
city  
's  
security  
and  
safety  
,  
and  
ask V V
them  
to  
lift V V
their  
hands  
from  
the  
city  
.  
"  

The  
clerics  
demanded V V
talks V V
with  
local  
US  
commanders  
.  

Falluja  
has V V
long  
been V V
roiled V V
by  
tense  
relations V V
with  
the  
US  
soldiers  
there  
,  
since  
local  
Sunnis  
either  
remain V V
committed V V
to  
Arab  
nationalism  
or  
have V V
become V V
Sunni  
fundamentalists  
or  
even  
radicals  
.  

Cities  
such  
as  
Falluja  
received V V
special  
treatment V V
from  
Saddam  
and  
enjoyed V V
a  
disproportionate  
share V V
of  
the  
country  
's  
wealth  
and  
power  
.  

They  
know V V
that  
the  
American  
advent  V
implies V V
for  
them  
a  
demotion V V
,  
and  
an  
elevation V V
of  
the  
Shiites  
and  
Kurds  
,  
and  
they  
refuse V V
to  
go V V
quietly  
.

only  
be V V

but  
should  
be V V
constitutionally  
excluded V V
)  
has V V
pushed V V
Sudan  
not  
just  
off  
the  
front  
pages  
,  
or  
the  
A  
section  
,  
but  
out  
of  
the  
NY  
Times  
and  
Washington  
Post  
completely  
.  

I  
had V V
to  
go V V
to  
the  
BBC  
for  
this  
report V V
.  

It  
's V V
symptomatic V 
,  
I  
suppose V V
,  
of  
our  
fast  
-  
paced  
,  
24  
hour  
news  
-  
cycle  
lives  
,  
that  
the  
biggest  
short  
-  
term  
humanitarian  
crisis  
in  
the  
world  
would  
quickly  
be V V
eclipsed V V
,  
once  
our  
Secretary  
of  
State  
was V V
finished V V
with  
his  
whirlwind  
tour V V
,  
from  
the  
newspapers  
.  

It  
's V V
just  
disappointing V 
.  

Most  
troubling  
,  
however  
,  
is V V
the  
fact  
that  
the  
political  
will  
to  
end V V
the  
crisis  
expressed V V
a  
few  
short  
weeks  
ago  
seems V V
to  
have V V
ebbed V V
.  

At  
that  
time  
,  
UN  
Secretary  
General  
Kofi  
Annan  
demanded V V
steps V V
be V V
taken V V
to  
end V V
the  
ethnic  
violence  
in  
Darfur  
within  
48  
hours  
.  

Two  
weeks  
later  
,  
and  
the  
violence  
continues V V
.  

The  
African  
Union  
is V V
clearly  
not  
up  
to  
the  
task V V
of  
keeping V V
the  
peace V V
,  
pledging V V
300  
troops  
to  
an  
area  
that  
will  
need V V
15,000  
,  
according  
to  
analysts  
.  

And  
international  
donors  
have V V
given V V
only  
half  
of  
the  
relief  
aid V V
that  
Darfur  
needs V V
,  
according  
to  
the  
local  
UN  
officials  
.  

So  
hear  V
we  
are V V
,  
two  
weeks  
later  
,  
after  
that  
dazzling  
PR  
display V V
two  
weeks  
ago  
by  
Powell  
and  
Annan  
,  
and  
the  
situation  
on  
the  
ground  
in  
Darfur  
appears V V
basically  
unchanged V V
.  

Warren  
Buffett  
is V V
giving V V
away  
85  
%  
of  
his  
wealth  
,  
mostly  
to  
the  
Bill  
and  
Melinda  
Gates  
Foundation  
.  

It  
's V V
a  
move V V
that  
really  
worries V V
me  
;  
Buffett  
's  
usual  
justification V V
for  
keeping V V
most  
of  
his  
money  
was V V
that  
he  
was V V
still  
compounding V V
the  
value  
of  
his  
fortune  
at  
a  
pretty  
high  
rate  
,  
so  
any  
gifts  
now  
would  
mean V V
significantly  
less  
money  
for  
the  
foundation  
later  
.  

It  
's V V
a  
little  
hard V V
to  
parse V V
,  
but  
at  
this  
point  
his  
ostensible  
view V V
is V V
that  
the  
Gateses  
are V V
very  
good  
money  
-  
redistributors  
,  
and  
he  
wants V V
them  
to  
have V V
the  
money  
as  
soon  
as  
possible  
.  

Which  
essentially  
sounds V V
like  
he  
's V V
worried V V
that  
Bill  
or  
Melinda  
are V V
going V V
to  
die V V
soon  
.  

I  
assume V V
his  
actual  
reason  
is V V
that  
he  
's V V
worried V V
that  
Berkshire  
Hathaway  
just  
ca  
n't  
grow V V
quickly  
enough  
to  
justify V V
his  
usual  
charity  
policy  
.  

I  
'm V V
not  
sure V V
how  
the  
market  
will  
react V V
.  

It  
does V V
n't  
change V V
the  
company  
's  
intrinsic  
worth  
,  
and  
as  
the  
article  
notes V V
,  
the  
company  
might

On  
the

this

essentially  
a  
statement V V
that

It  
sounds V V
pretty  
rational V V
that  
he  
's V V
saying V V
that  
Bill

at  
a

Bill

an  
excellent  
essay  
on

the  
MSM  
and  
the  
UN  
,  
even  
the  
leftist  
countries  
in  
Europe  
,  
are V V
basically  
accepting V V
terrorist  
organizations  
as  
legitimate  
forms  
of  
a  
political  
party  
:  

On  
the  
same  
day  
Palestinians  
protest V V
in  
support V V
of  
Hezbollah  
and  
Syria  
,  
the  
terrorist  
group  
Hamas  
has V V
indicated V V
it  
will  
participate V V
in  
the  
scheduled  
upcoming  
Parliamentary  
elections V V
.  

To  
the  
north  
in  
Lebanon  
,  
there  
is V V
serious  
debate V V
within  
Hezbollah  
about  
entering V V
the  
Lebanese  
political  
process V V
in  
light  
of  
Syria  
's  
promised  
withdrawal V V
.  

Syria  
has V V
agreed V V
to  
withdraw V V
under  
the  
conditions  
set V V
forth  
in  
UNSC  
Resolution  
1559  
,  
which  
has V V
already  
begun V V
.  

UN  
Secretary  
-  
General  
Kofi  
Annan  
has V V
indicated V V
it  
is V V
time  
to  
"  
recognize V V
Hezbollah  
"  
after  
easily  
being V V
duped V V
by  
"  
the  
message  
on  
the  
placards  
they  
are V V
using V V
"  
.  

This  
acceptance V V
of  
blatantly  
terrorist  
groups  
as  
legitimate  
freedom  
movements V V
is V V
a  
cancerous  
tumor  
on  
the  
United  
Nations  
and  
the  
media  
.  

Over  
three  
years  
after  
9-11  
,  
the  
United  
Nations  
,  
despite  
their  
attempts V V
to  
project V V
strength  
in  
fighting V V
terrorism  
,  
still  
can  
not  
properly  
define V V
the  
word  
"  
terrorist  
"  
,  
waffling V V
over  
the  
issue V V
of  
whether  
the  
murder V V
of  
innocent  
civilians  
are V V
terrorist  
acts  
.  

The  
media  
routinely  
obscures V V
the  
lines  
between  
terrorism  
and  
legitimate  
resistance V V
,  
as  
the  
recent  
article  
by  
Daniel  
Okrent  
of  
The  
New  
York  
Times  
demonstrates V V
.  

...  

The  
decision V V
to  
sidestep V V
the  
obvious  
to  
satisfy V V
the  
need V V
to  
avoid V V
confrontation V V
does V V
not  
bring V V
peace V V
,  
but  
only  
delays V V
the  
eventual  
conflict V V
as  
the  
predators  
of  
Hamas  
and  
Hezbollah  
exploit V V
the  
inherent  
weakness  
of  
the  
internationals  
and  
the  
media  
.  

I  
've V V
been V V
fuming V V
over  
this  
fact  
for  
a  
few  
weeks  
now  
,  
ever  
since  
some  
organizations  
and  
governments  
suggested V V
we  
need V V
to  
accept V V
the  
fact  
that  
Hezbollah  
will  
get V V
involved V V
in  
running V V
Lebanon  
.  

Wtf  
is V V
this  
?  

This  
is V V
a  
terrorist  
organization  
plain V 
and  
simple V 
.  

This  
is V V
the  
organization  
that  
bombed V V
our  
Marine  
barracks  
in  
1983  
,  
took V V
Americans  
hostage  
throughout  
the  
80's  
and  
now  
they  
should  
be V V
considered V V
a  
legitimate  
organization  
?  

This  
is V V
just  
another  
reason  
to  
never  
trust V V
the  
MSM  
,  
and  
certainly  
not  
the  
Europeans  
.  

The  
Iraqi  
Islamic  
Party  
lead V V
by  
Muhsin  
Abdul  
Hamid  
,  
has V V
been V V
among  
the  
few  
Sunni  
Muslim  
groups  
willing  
to  
cooperate V V
(  
even  
if  
rather  
lukewarmly  
)  
with  
the  
Americans  
.  

It  
is V V
now  
threatening V V
to  
pull V V
out  
of  
the  
Allawi  
caretaker  
government  
.  

The  
IIP  
had V V
also  
been V V
the  
main  
force  
urging V V
Sunni  
Arabs  
to  
participate V V
in  
the  
elections V V
scheduled V V
for  
January  
,  
and  
had V V
been V V
opposed V V
in  
this  
stance V 
by  
the  
Association  
of  
Muslim  
Scholars  
.  

That  
the  
Iraqi  
Islamic  
Party  
is V V
now  
contemplating V V
leaving V V
the  
Allawi  
government  
raises V V
the  
question V V
of  
whether  
a  
mass  
Sunni  
Arab  
boycott V 
of  
the  
elections V V
is V V
in  
the  
offing  
,  
thus  
fatally  
weakening V V
the  
legitimacy  
of  
any  
new  
government  
.  

Az  
-  
Zaman  
:  
The  
Association  
of  
Muslim  
Scholars  
forbade V V
Iraqis  
to  
participate V V
in  
the  
attack V V
on  
Fallujah  
with  
the  
Americans  
.  

In  
a  
communique  
,  
the  
AMS  
said V V
that  
for  
Iraqis  
to  
take V V
part  V
with  
"  
raiding V 
forces  
"  
in  
the  
assault V V
on  
a  
city  
,  
the  
population V V
of  
which  
is V V
Muslim  
(  
such  
as  
Fallujah  
)  
would  
be V V
considered V V
the  
most  
mortal  
of  
mortal  
sins  
.  

The  
Sunni  
AMS  
told V V
Iraqis  
,  
"  
You  
sinned V V
when  
you  
participated V V
with  
occupation  
forces  
in  
the  
assault V V
on  
Najaf  
,  
and  
beware V V
lest  
you  
repeat V V
this  
same  
sin  
in  
Fallujah  
.  

Remember V V
that  
the  
Occupation V V
is V V
emphemeral  
.  
"  

The  
radical  
Shiite  
Sadr  
movement V V
issued V V
a  
statement V V
forbidding V V
the  
participation V V
of  
Iraqi  
troops  
in  
the  
attack V V
on  
Fallujah  
,  
as  
well  
.  

The  
statement V V
said V V
,  
"  
We  
direct V V
an  
appeal V V
at  
the  
men  
in  
the  
Iraqi  
forces  
,  
whether  
national  
guards  
or  
others  
,  
the  
majority  
of  
whom  
are V V
Muslim  
,  
calling V V
upon V 
them  
to  
refrain V V
for  
commiting V V
this  
enormous  
sin  
under  
the  
banner  
of  
forces  
that  
do V V
not  
respect V V
our  
religion  
or  
any  
principles  
of  
basic  
humanity  
,  
and  
we  
ask V V
them  
to  
view V V
this  
war V V
as  
illegal  V
.  
"  

It  
called V V
a  
"  
ploy  V
"  
the  
assertaion V V
that  
the  
attack V V
was V V
merely  
on  
foreign  
fighters  
at  
Fallujah  
.  

The  
convergence V V
of  
views V V
among  
the  
more  
militant  
Sunni  
Muslim  
clerics  
of  
AMS  
and  
the  
radical  
Shiites  
of  
the  
Sadr  
movement V V
has V V
been V V
seen V V
before  
,  
last  
spring  
during  
the  
initial  
US  
assault V V
on  
Fallujah  
and  
during  
the  
US  
attack V V
on  
Mahdi  
Army  
militiamen  
in  
Najaf  
.  

Most  
Shiites  
,  
however  
,  
are V V
still  
reluctant V V
to  
take V V
major  
risks V V
to  
support V V
the  
Sunnis  
of  
Fallujah  
,  
many  
of  
whom  
had V V
supported V V
Saddam  
and  
his  
anti-Shiite  
pogroms  
.  

President  
Bush  
pinched V V
a  
few  
nerves  
yesterday  
with  
his  
choice V V
of  
words  
:  

WASHINGTON  
(  
Reuters  
)  
-  

U.S.  
Muslim  
groups  
criticized  
President  
Bush  
on  
Thursday  
for  
calling V V
a  
foiled V 
plot V V
to  
blow V V
up  
airplanes  
part  
of  
a  
"  
war V V
with  
Islamic  
fascists  
,  
"  
saying V V
the  
term  
could  
inflame V V
anti-Muslim  
tensions V V
.  

U.S.  
officials  
have V V
said V V
the  
plot V V
,  
thwarted V V
by  
Britain  
,  
to  
blow V V
up  
several  
aircraft  
over  
the  
Atlantic  
bore V V
many  
of  
the  
hallmarks  
of  
al  
Qaeda  
.  

"  
We  
believe V V
this  
is V V
an  
ill  
-  
advised V 
term  
and  
we  
believe V V
that  
it  
is V V
counterproductive V 
to  
associate V V
Islam  
or  
Muslims  
with  
fascism  
,  
"  
said V V
Nihad  
Awad  
,  
executive  
director  
of  
the  
Council  
on  
American  
-  
Islamic  
Relations  
advocacy  
group  
.  

Which  
is V V
why  
he  
did V V
n't  
say V V
we  
're V V
at  
war V V
with  
Islamic  
people  
.  

We  
're V V
at  
war V V
with  
Islamic  
fascists  
.  

By  
using V V
the  
word  
"  
Islamic  
"  
as  
an  
adjective  
Bush  
was V V
purposely  
not  
associating V V
Muslims  
with  
fascism  
,  
hence  
the  
qualifier

al  
-  
Qaeda  
during  
the  
Afghan  
resistance  
days  
.  

One  
witness  
at  
the  
Moutasaddiq  
trial V V
in  
Germany  
alleged V V
that  
Zarqawi  
had V V
not  
allowed V V
Monotheism  
and  
Holy  
War  
to  
share V V
resources  
with  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
in  
the  
early  
zeroes  
of  
the  
21st  
century  
.  

If  
the  
statement V V
is V V
true V V
,  
it  
is V V
a  
worrying  
sign V V
that  
even  
the  
divided  
small  
radical  
guerrilla  
groups  
are V V
being V V
"  
picked V V
up  
"  
by  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
.  

This  
consolidation V V
is V V
obviously  
a  
result  
of  
Bush  
's  
aggressive  
invasion V V
of  
Iraq  
and  
of  
the  
botching V V
of  
the  
aftermath  
.  

It  
is V V
a  
setback  
for  
the  
war V V
on  
terror  
.  

Al  
-  
Qaeda  
in  
Afghanistan  
was V V
a  
group  
of  
only  
a  
few  
hundred  
"  
Afghan  
Arabs  
"  
who  
pledged V V
personal  
loyalty  
to  
Usamah  
Bin  
Laden  
.  

It  
could  
notionally  
be V V
expanded V V
to  
encompass V V
the  
5,000  
-  
strong  
"  
55th  
Brigade  
"  
of  
the  
Taliban  
regime  
,  
though  
this  
is V V
not  
the  
technical  
definition V V
.  

Because  
Usamah  
is V V
Saudi  
,  
my  
guess V V
is V V
that  
they  
were V V
especially  
influenced V V
by  
an  
extremist  
form  
of  
the  
Wahhabi  
school  
of  
Islam  
that  
predominates V V
among  
Saudia  
's  
some  
15  
million  
citizens  
.  

In  
1998  
they  
were V V
joined V V
by  
Egyptians  
from  
the  
al  
-  
Jihad  
al  
-  
Islami  
group  
of  
Ayman  
al  
-  
Zawahiri  
(  
many  
of  
these  
were V V
from  
Upper  
Egypt  
,  
especially  
Asyut  
and  
environs  
)  
.  

After  
that  
point  
,  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
was V V
a  
joint  
enterprise  
between  
the  
Egyptian  
extremists  
and  
the  
polyglot  
Arabs  
around  
Bin  
Laden  
,  
only  
some  
of  
whom  
were V V
Saudi  
.  

Zarqawi  
is V V
a  
Jordanian  
,  
and  
his  
Monotheism  
and  
Holy  
War  
group  
in  
Afghanistan  
probably  
had V V
a  
distinctive  
coloration V V
as  
mainly  
Jordanian  
,  
Palestinian  
and  
Syrian  
.  

They  
also  
had V V
a  
special  
connection V V
to  
some  
extremists  
in  
Jordan  
and  
Germany  
.  

They  
are V V
probably  
especially  
oriented V V
toward  
the  
Salafi  
school  
of  
modern  
Islamic  
thought V V
,  
which  
has V V
a  
Protestant  
-  
like  
emphasis V 
on  
going V V
back  
to  
the  
original  
practice  
of  
the  
early  
companions  
of  
the  
Prophet  
Muhammad  
.  

(  
Most  
Salafis  
are V V
not  
militant  
or  
violent V 
,  
though  
they  
tend V V
to  
be V V
rather  
narrow  V
-  
minded  
in  
my  
experience V V
,  
on  
the  
order  V
of  
Protestant  
Pietists  
)  
.  

Monotheism  
and  
Holy  
War  
obviously  
does V V
have V V
a  
violent  
interpretation V V
of  
Salafism  
,  
rather  
as  
the  
the  
leaders  
of  
the  
so  
-  
called  
German  
Peasant  
Rebellion  
among  
early  
Protestants  
did V V
.  

Another  
worrisome  
sign V V
is V V
that  
local  
Iraqi  
Sunni  
fundamentalists  
opposed V V
to  
the  
US  
presence  
in  
Iraq  
have V V
begun V V
joining V V
Monotheism  
and  
Holy  
War  
,  
and  
wearing V V
its  
distinctive  
orange  
and  
black  
insignia  
.  

These  
have V V
been V V
sighted V V
among  
Iraqi  
crowds  
on  
Haifa  
Street  
in  
Baghdad  
and  
in  
Samarra  
.  

So  
now  
there  
are V V
hundreds  
of  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
members  
in  
Iraq  
where  
there  
had V V
been V V
none  
before  
.  

The  
consolidation V V
of  
smaller  
local  
radical  
fundamentalist  
groups  
with  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
can  
also  
be V V
seen V V
in  
the  
case V V
of  
the  
Fizazi  
group  
in  
Tangiers  
that  
morphed V V
into  
the  
Moroccan  
Islamic  
Combatant  
Group  
,  
had V V
members  
who  
met V V
with  
September  
11  
ringleader  
Muhammad  
Atta  
,  
and  
ultimately  
was V V
in  
part  
responsible V V
for  
the  
Madrid  
train  
bombings V V
.  

The  
September  
11  
Panel  
will  
issue V V
its  
findings V V
on  
Thursday  
.  

It  
notes V V
10  
points  
at  
which  
the  
US  
made V V
key  
mistakes V V
that  
might  
have V V
stopped V V
Bin  
Laden  
's  
plot V V
.  

Four  
of  
these  
were V V
under  
Clinton  
and  
6  
under  
Bush  
.  

Bush  
came V V
out  
today  
and  
said V V
that  
if  
he  
had V V
known V V
what  
was V V
coming V V
,  
he  
would  
have V V
expended V V
every  
effort V V
to  
stop V V
it  
,  
and  
that  
so  
would  
have V V
Clinton  
.  

This  
statement V V
is V V
,  
despite  
its  
facade  
of  
fair  
-  
mindedness  
,  
so  
many  
weasel  
words  
.  

Of  
course  
Bush  
would  
have V V
tried V V
to  
stop V V
9/11  
if  
he  
had V V
known V V
it  
was V V
coming V V
.  

The  
question V V
is V V
,  
"  
Should  
he  
have V V
known V V
it  
was V V
coming V V
?  
"  

The  
answer V V
is V V
,  
"  
Yes  
!  
"  

We  
now  
know V V
that  
Bush  
and  
his  
administration V V
came V V
into  
office  
obsessed V 
with  
Iraq  
.  

Cheney  
was V V
looking V V
at  
maps  
of  
Iraq  
oil  
fields  
and  
muttering V V
about  
opportunities  
for  
US  
companies  
there  
,  
already  
in  
January  
or  
February  
of  
2001  
.  

Wolfowitz  
contradicted V V
counter-terrorism  
czar  
Richard  
Clarke  
when  
the  
latter  
spoke V V
of  
the  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
threat  
,  
insisting V V
that  
the  
preeminent  
threat  
of  
terrorism  
against  
the  
US  
came V V
from  
Iraq  
,  
and  
indicating V V
he  
accepted V V
Laurie  
Mylroie  
's  
crackpot  
conspiracy  
theory  
that  
Saddam  
was V V
behind  
the  
1993  
World  
Trade  
Towers  
bombing V V
.  

If  
you  
believe V V
crackpot  
theories  
instead  
of  
focusing V V
on  
the  
reality  
--  
that  
was V V
an  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
operation V V
mainly  
carried V V
out  
by  
al  
-  
Gamaa  
al  
-  
Islamiyyah  
,  
an  
Egyptian  
terrorist  
component  
allied V V
with  
Bin  
Laden  
--  
then  
you  
will  
concentrate V V
on  
the  
wrong  
threat  
.  

Even  
after  
the  
attacks V V
on  
September  
11  
,  
Bush  
was V V
obsessing V V
about  
Iraq  
.  

Wolfowitz  
lied V V
to  
him  
and  
said V V
that  
there  
was V V
a  
10  
to  
50  
%  
chance V V
that  
Iraq  
was V V
behind  
them  
.  

(  
On  
what  
evidence  
?  

The  
hijackers  
were V V
obviously  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
,  
and  
no  
operational  
links  
between  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
and  
Iraq  
had V V
ever  
been V V
found V V
)  
.  

Rumsfeld  
initially  
rejected V V
an  
attack V V
on  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
bases  
in  
Afghanistan  
,  
saying V V
there  
were V V
"  
no  
good  
targets  
"  
in  
Afghanistan  
.  

(  
What  
about  
40  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
bases  
that  
had V V
trained V V
the  
9/11  
hijackers  
and  
other  
terrorists  
gunning V V
for  
the  
United  
States  
??  
)  

The  
Pentagon  
did V V
not  
even  
have V V
a  
plan V V
for  
dealing V V
with  
Afghanistan  
or  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
that  
it  
could  
pull V V
off  
the  
shelf  
,  
according  
to  
Bob  
Woodward  
.  

Bush  
did V V
not  
have V V
his  
eye  
on  
the  
ball  
.  

Neither  
did  
Cheney  
,  
Rumsfeld  
,  
or  
Wolfowitz  
.  

They  
were V V
playing V V
Captain  
Ahab  
to  
Saddam  
's  
great  
white  
whale  
.  

Imperial  
Hubris  
makes V V
the  
case V V
that  
lots  
of  
people  
in  
the  
CIA  
and  
counter-terrorism  
divisions  
elsewhere  
in  
the  
US  
government  
knew V V
all  
about  
Bin  
Laden  
and  
the  
threat  
he  
posed V V
.  

They  
were V V
from  
all  
accounts V 
marginalized V V
and  
not  
listened V V
to  
.  

Bush  
demoted V V
Dick  
Clarke  
,  
among  
the  
most  
vocal  
and  
focused  
of  
the  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
experts  
,  
from  
his  
cabinet  
.  

Dick  
could  
never  
thereafter  
get V V
any  
real  
cooperation V V
from  
the  
cabinet  
officers  
,  
who  
outranked V V
him  
,  
and  
he  
could  
not  
convince V V
them  
to  
go V V
to  
battle  
stations  
in  
the  
summer  
of  
2001  
when  
George  
Tenet  
's  
hair  
was V V
"  
on  
fire V V
"  
about  
the  
excited  
chatter  V
the  
CIA  
was V V
picking V V
up  
from  
radical  
Islamist  
terrorists  
.  

As  
for  
the  
Clinton  
administration V V
,  
let V V
me  
say V V
one  
thing  
in  
its  
defense V V
.  

Clinton  
had V V
worked V V
out  
a  
deal V V
with  
Pakistani  
Prime  
Minister  
Nawaz  
Sharif  
in  
summer  
of  
1999  
that  
would  
have V V
allowed V V
the  
US  
to  
send V V
a  
Special  
Ops  
team  
in  
after  
Bin  
Laden  
in  
Qandahar  
,  
based V V
from  
Pakistan  
.  

I  
presume V V
you  
need V V
the  
Pakistan  
base  
for  
rescue  
operations V V
in  
case  
anything  
went V V
wrong V V
.  

You  
also  
need V V
Pakistani  
air  
space  
.  

The  
plan V V
was V V
all  
set V V
and  
could  
have V V
succeeded V V
.  

But  
in  
fall  
of  
1999  
,  
Gen.  
Pervez  
Musharraf  
made V V
a  
coup V 
against  
Nawaz  
Sharif  
.  

The  
Pakistani  
army  
was V V
rife V V
with  
elements  
protective  
of  
the  
Taliban  
,  
and  
the  
new  
military  
government  
reneged V V
on  
the  
deal V V
.  

Musharraf  
told V V
Clinton  
he  
could  
n't  
use V V
Pakistani  
soil  
or  
air  
space  
to  
send V V
the  
team  
in  
against  
Bin  
Laden  
.  

Look V V
at  
a  
map  
and  
you  
try V V
to  
figure V V
out  
how  
,  
in  
fall  
of  
1999  
,  
you  
could  
possibly  
pull V V
off  
such  
an  
operation V V
without  
Pakistani  
facilities  
.  

Of  
course  
,  
you  
could  
just  
go V V
in  
by  
main  
force  
.  

But  
for  
those  
of  
you  
tempted V V
in  
that  
direction  
,  
please  
look V V
up  
Carter  
's  
Tabas  
operation V V
.  

It  
should  
be V V
easily  
googled V V
.  

Clinton  
tried V V
,  
and  
tried V V
hard  
.  

The  
gods  
were V V
n't  
with  
us  
on  
that  
one  
.  

that  
is V V
how  
i  
want V V
you  
to  
refer V V
to  
me  
as  
"  
the  
king  
"  

i  
do V V
n't  
think V V
so  
.  

i  
'm V V
the  
king  

yeah  

sounds V V
exciting V V
.  

want V V
to  
go V V
to  
dinner  
with  
me  
before  
you  
have V V
your  
'  
matt  
time  
'  
?  

probablyl  
gon V V
na  
just  
kick V V

know V V
,  
whatever  
.  

i  
will

later  
.

have V V
one

they  
are V V
great  
dogs  
.  

cocker  
spaniels  
are V V
retarded  
.  

why  
do V V
you  
think V V
i  
should  
get V V
one  
of  
those  
?  

ca  
n't  
believe V V

jacket

like  
tony

.  

someplace  
that  
is V V
like  
$  
30  
an  
entree  
.  

yeah

i  
was V V
thinking V V
somewhere  
like  
mcdonald  
's  
.  

that  
may  
be V V
too  
nice V V
though  
.

must  
be V V
thinking V V
of  
someone  
else  
.  

i  
do V V
n't  
even  
like V V
a&m

i  
would  
n't  
bet V V
on

planning V V

John  
,  

Hello  
from  
South  
America  
.  

I  
just  
got V V
your  
email V V
and  
I  
certainly  
concur V V
with  
Jeff  
making V V
the  
call V V
.  

He  
has V V
maintained V V
a  
good  
relationship V V
with  
Mulva  
.  

This  
was V V
a  
risk V V
that  
we  
had V V
but  
we  
did V V
have V V
assurances V V
from  
Phillips  
regarding  
performance V V
.  

I  
do V V
n't  
know V V
how  
much  
it  
will  
help V V
however  
.  

Richard  
Harper  
and  
Mary  
Nell  
Browning  
may  
have V V
some  
ideas  
here  
but  
I  
am V V
sure V V
you  
've V V
already  
gone V V
through  
it  
with  
them  
.  

I  
am V V
amazed V V
how  
the  
details  
get V V
fuzzy V 
on  
an  
old  
project  
.  

When  
you  
discussed V V
it  
,  
i  
was V V
trying V V
to  
think V V
back  
to  
our  
remedies  
and  
discussions V V
but  
the  
3  
years  
have V V
made V V
it  
difficult V V
.  

I  
do V V
n't  
know V V
if  
there  
is V V
anything  
I  
can  
do V V
but  
I  
'm V V
always  
willing V V
to  
help V V
.  

Good  
luck  
,  

Mike  

These  
guys  
tried V V
the  
Ken  
Lay  
route  
.  

Now  
they  
are V V

not  
sure

i  
assume V V
that  
the  
bluegrass

is V V
mine  
.  

is V V
it  
for  
guitar  
?  

I  
'll  
need V V
to  
ponder V V
.  

I  
'll  
try V V
to  
get V V
back  
to  
you  
pronto  
.  

FYI  
.  

We  
have V V
this  
report V V
?  

Hi  
David  
:  

Thought V V
that  
you  
might  
be V V
interested V V
.  

Best  
,  

Jeff  

Well  
,  
he  
launched V V
today  
.  

Have V V
you  
seen V V
the  
materials  
from  
the  
press  
conference V V
that  
he  
launched V V
today  
?  

I  
think V V
this  
is V V
actually  
a  
good  
thing  
--  
makes V V
our  
proposal V V
look V V
like  
a  
much  
more  
preferable  
alternative  
by  
comparison V V
,  
makes V V
our  
support V V
in  
the  
process V V
more  
important V V
,  
and  
sets V V
Harvey  
up  
as  
the  
Ralph  
Nader  
equivalent  
in  
the  
election V V
to  
fix V V
California  
's  
broken  
system  
---  
a  
potential  
spoiler  
.  

Hi  
.  

Well  
,  
would  
n't  
you  
know V V
it  
.  

I  
'm V V
not  
driving V V
tonite  
,  
but  
I  
bet V V
that  
we  
could  
hitch V V
a  
ride V V
back  
with  
Anil  
.  

I  
'm V V
not  
sure V V
,  
but  
I  
think V V
that  
he  
's V V
got V V
class  
tonite  
,  
too  
.  

I  
'll  
search V V
him  
out  
before  
class  
or  
after  
that  
break V V
and  
see V V
if  
I  
can  
set V V
it  
up  
.  

daily  
dose  V
on  
enron  
-  

we  
are V V
finished V V
.  

i  
need V V
to  
now  
get V V
a  
job  
at  
house  
of  
pies  
b/c  
that  
is V V
the  
only  
way  V
to  
pay V V
the  
bills  
.  

the  
economy  
is V V
down  
and  
when  
enron  
collapses V V
,  
the  
energy  
industry  
is V V
going V V
to  
be V V
in  
a  
world  
of  
hurt  
.  

not  
to  
mention  
the  
market  
is V V
going V V
to  
be V V
flooded V V
with  
enron  
folks  
.  

ca  
n't  
go V V
to  
any  
more  
lsu  
games  
unless  
i  
get V V
a  
free  
ticket  
.  

Since  
work V V
has V V
gone V V
to  
hell  
,  
I  
am V V
hoping V V
to  
find V V
some  
excitement V 
in  
the  
possibility  
that  
LSU  
may  
play V V
in  
the  
Cotton  
Bowl  
(  
if  
Rohan  
"  
Alabama  
"  
Davey  
shows V V
up  
for  
the  
next  
3  
games  
.  
)  

However  
,  
do V V
not  
purchase V V
tickets  
until  
it  
is V V
a  
done  
deal V V
-  
a  
lesson V V
I  
learned V V
following  
the  
Ark  
game  
last  
season

you

.  

house

here  
i  
come V V
.  

i  
am V V
sure V V
i  
could  
have V V
persuaded V V
you  
to  
give V V
me  
some  
action V V
.  

why  
is V V
enron  
blowing V V
up  
?  

i  
did V V
n't  
want V V
you  
to  
go V V
.  

i  
was V V
just  
going V V
to  
sleep V V
anyway  
.  

i  
was V V
too  
tired V V
to  
give V V
you  
any  
action V V
.  

enron  
is V V
blowing V V
up  
.  

Vince  
,  

We  
are V V
still  
trying V V
to  
work V V
the  
PSE  
swap  
transaction V V
,  
now  
that  
the  
forex  
desk  
has V V
been V V
able V V
to  
find V V
a  
fix V V
for  
CPI  
in  
the  
market  
.  

Further  
to  
my  
voicemail  
,  
our  
colleagues  
in  
credit V V
are V V
calculating V V
the  
reserve  
on  
the  
PSE  
swap  
.  

They  
are V V
currently  
using V V
9.5  
%  
fixed V 
based  
on  
the  
1  
year  
implied V 
volatility  
.  

Volatility  
of  
USD  
/  
DM  
has V V
been V V
in  
the  
range  
of  
between  
7  
%  
and  
11  
%  
.  

Can  
one  
of  
your  
research  
staff  
justify V V
a  
suitable  
20  
year  
volalatility  
number  
for  
USD  
/  
Euro  
.  

Ideally  
,  
we  
would  
like V V
a  
fast  
turnaround  V
.  

In  
addition V V
,  
is V V
there  
someone  
who  
could  
consider V V
the  
correlation V V
between  
US  
CPI  
and  
the  
$  
/  
euro  
exchange  
rate  
.  

The  
credit  
guys  
are V V
currently  
assuming V V
that  
there  
is V V
no  
correlation V V
and  
may  
consequently  
be V V
double  
dipping V V
the  
credit  
reserve  
on  
this  
basis  
too  
.  

Grateful  
for  
any  
help V V
or  
suggestions V V
you  
could  
provide V V
.  

Sid  

Vincent  
,  

I  
met V V
you  
at  
the  
Risk V 
conference V V
last  
week  
in  
Houston  
.  

I  
enjoyed V V
your  
presentations V V
very  
much  
.  

I  
was V V
wondering V V
if  
you  
could  
give V V
me  
some  
references V V
regarding  
the  
calculation V V
of  
correlation  
coefficients

Hi

I  
just  
wanted V V
to  
follow V V
up  
on  
whether  
you  
will  
have V V
a  
chance V V

similar  
in

with

)  
.  

I  
understand V V
you  
may  
not  
have V V
credit  
approval V V
yet  
so  
perhaps  
we  
can  
leave V V
the  
appropriate

in

Daren  
,  

I  
was V V
wondering V V
if  
it  
would  
be V V
OK  
for  
me  
to  
sit V V
in  
with  
you  
one  
day  
to  
get V V
a  
general  
feel  
of  
your  
end  V
of  
the  
process V V
.  

Pat  
had V V
told V V
me  
before  
he  
left V V
that  
it  
would  
help V V
me  
better  
grasp V V
the  
process V V
as  
a  
whole  
.  

I  
understand V V
the  
imminent  
cold  
weather  
is V V
making V V
things  
crazy V V
,  
so  
now  
may  
not  
be V V
the  
best  
time  
to  
be V V
in  
your  
way V V
.  

But  
let V V
me  
know V V
if  
I  
can  
spend V V
a  
day  
,  
morning  
,  
or  
even  
just  
an  
afternoon  
down  
there  
with  
you  
whenever  
it  
is V V
a  
good  
time  
.  

I  
think V V
it  
will  
help V V
me  
very  
much  
in  
my  
role  
.  

Thanks V V

The  
Dow  
topped V V
out  
in  
February  
of  
1966  
at  
995  
.  

By  
September  
of  
that  
year  
the  
Dow  
had V V
tumbled V V
to  
744  
.  

The  
Dow  
then  
rallied V V
to  
a  
high  
of  
943  
in  
September  
of  
'67  
.  

By  
March  
of  
'68  
the  
Dow  
had V V
fallen V V
to  
825  
,  
only  
to  
climb V V
to  
a  
highly  
speculative  
peak  
of  
985  
in  
December  
of  
'68  
.  

The  
Dow  
then  
sank V V
to  
631  
in  
December  
of  
'70  
.  

By  
April  
of  
'71  
the  
Dow  
had V V
climbed V V
back  
to  
950  
,  
only  
to  
fall V V
to  
869  
in  
February  
of  
'72  
.  

A  
big  
rally V V
then  
took V V
the  
Dow  
(  
unconfirmed  
)  
to  
a  
record  
high  
of  
1051  
in  
January  
of  
'73  
,  
turning V V
everyone  
bullish  
.  

But  
by  
December  
of  
'73  
the  
Dow  
had V V
collapsed V V
to  
788  
.  

Think V V
that  
was V V
bad V V
-  
by  
December  
of  
'74  
the  
Dow  
had V V
sunk V V
to  
a  
bear  
market  
low  
of  
577  
.  

At  
that  
time  
,  
the  
gurus  
and  
geniuses  
of  
Wall  
Street  
were V V
predicting V V
a  
250  
Dow  
and  
many  
were V V
talking V V
openly  
about  
the  
end V V
of  
capitalism  
.  

Of  
course  
,  
that  
was V V
the  
bottom  

And  
that  
's V V
the  
way V V
the  
greatest  
bear  
market  
since  
the  
Depression  
worked V V
its  
way V V
down  
.  

By  
late  
1974  
investors  
were V V
dizzy V V
,  
they  
were V V
desperate V V
,  
they  
were V V
wrung V V
-  
out  
,  
they  
had V V
left V V
Wall  
Street  
,  
many  
for  
good  
.

The  
results  
of  
the  
February  
26th  
PVT  
test V V
conducted V V
on  
Nville  
have V V
been V V
discussed V V
with  
each  
of  
you  
over  
the  
last  
three  
months  
.  

As  
we  
have V V
discussed V V
....  
effective V 
Sep  
13th  
,  
Anita  
will  
make V V
the  
adjustments V V
to  
Enron  
's  
inventory  
and  
pad  V
gas  
to  
reflect V V
the  
February  
26th  
results  
.  

I  
talked V V
with  
Gary  
Wilson  
,  
and  
he  
confirmed V V
that  
the  
revised  
values  
are V V
correct V V
.  

Attached V V
is V V
a  
spreadsheet  
that  
contains V V
the  
values  
.  

The  
correction V V
to  
the  
working  
gas  
includes V V
TWO  
corrections V V
.  

The  
results  
of  
the  
February  
26th  
test V V
reduces V V
the  
working  
gas  
by  
398,487  
MMBTU  
.  

In  
addition V V
,  
there  
is V V
a  
reduction V V
of  
22,101  
MMBTU  
which  
is V V
the  
difference V V
between  
the  
SCADA  
values  
(  
Best  
Available  
)  
that  
Anita  
showed V V
on  
the  
February  
29th  
Storage  
Sheet  
and  
the  
"  
official  
"  
February  
29th  
values  
that  
Gary  
Wilson  
received V V
from  
MIPS  
.  

To  
summarize V V
:  
Enron  
's  
pad  
gas  
will  
now  
be V V
3,993,310  
MMBTU  
,  
instead  
of  
4,223,000  
MMBTU  
.  

Enron  
's  
working  
gas  
will  
be V V
reduced V V
by  
420,588  
MMBTU  
.

normal V V
to  
drink V V
all  
day  
at  
a  
bar  
,  
then  
go V V
to  
dinner  
where  
you  
do V V
n't

half  
the  
people  
there  
and  
proceed V V
to  
get V V

thought V V
about

few  
times

already  
bad  
situation  
with  
my  
bullshit  
questions  V
.  

I  
'm V V
hearing V V
some  
pretty  
depressing  
stuff  
from  
the  
people  
I  
know V V
at  
ENE

I  
wish V V
I

the  
capital

open V V
my  
own  
shop

there  
will  
be V V
talent  
and  
opportunity  
a  
plenty  
on  
the  
market  
soon

I  
'll  
ask V V
around

I  
've V V
got V V
some  
friends  
at  
Duke

brothers  
(  
John

from

school  
)  
started V V
their  
own  
outfit  
a  
while  
back  
,  
and  
my  
old  
man  
is V V
at  
Schlumberger  
and  
has V V
good  
contacts V V
in  
general  
(  
if  
you  
are V V
n't  
married V V
to  
a  
trading  
environment  
)

Attached V V
are V V
clean  
and  
blacklined  
drafts  
of  
the  
Enron  
guaranties V 
to  
be V V
made V V
in  
support V V
of  
EPMI  
's  
obligations V V
under  
the  
Indian  
Mesa  
II  
Renewable  
Energy  
Purchase  
Agreement  V
(  
"  
PPA  
"  
)  
and  
Green  
Premium  
Sharing  
Agreement  V
(  
"  
GSPA  
"  
)  
.?  

The  
guaranty  
for  
the  
PPA  
is V V
blacklined V V
against  
the  
Enron  
EPC  
Contract  
guaranty  
in  
favor  
of  
the  
banks  
which  
was V V
granted V V
in  
connection V V
with  
our  
Cabazon  
Wind  
Power  
Project  
(  
the  
project  
most  
recently  
financed V V
by  
EWC  
)  
and  
the  
GPSA  
guaranty  
is V V
blacklined V V
against  
the  
PPA  
guaranty  
.  

As  
we  
discussed V V
last  
week  
,  
since  
the  
Enron  
guaranties  V
will  
need V V
to  
be V V
in  
a  
form  
that  
will  
acceptable V V
to  
our  
project  
lenders  
and  
equity  
participants  
,  
we  
thought V V
that  
we  
should  
start V V
with  
a  
form  
that  
was V V
used V V
in  
our  
last  
financing V V
and  
that  
was V V
negotiated V V
by  
Enron  
and  
the  
banks  
.  

We  
plan V V
to  
use V V
the  
same  
basic  
form  
for  
the  
Enron  
guaranty V 
that  
will  
be V V
made V V
in  
favor  
of  
EPMI  
with  
respect V V
to  
the  
seller  
's  
obligations V V
under  
the  
PPA  
.  

We  
will  
forward V V
the  
draft  
of  
that  
guaranty  
to  
you  
later  
today  
.  

Please  
feel V V
free V V
to  
give V V
me  
a  
call V V
if  
you  
have V V
any  
questions V V
concerning  
the  
attached  
guaranties

Here

This

40  
%  
may  
be V V
imposed V V
by  
the

the

amount  
is V V
purported V V

16  
billion  
(

we

Your  
suggestion V V
to  
introduce V V
the  
concept  
discussed V V
with  
one  
of  
the  
Lays  
is V V
welcomed V V
.  

I  
hope V V
that  
this  
would  
mean V V
that  
you  
would  
remain V V
involved V V
at  
some  
level  
.  

The  
design V V
of  
the  
model  
and  
its  
potential  
economics  
could  
be V V
key V 
to  
how  
worthy  
the  
effort V V
might  
be V V
.  

Enron  
could  
be V V
an  
ideal  
environment  
from  
which  
to  
the  
concept  
enhancement  V
through  
to  
commercialization V V
could  
be V V
successfully  
accomplished V V
.  

Please  
confidentially  
share V V
matters  
as  
you  
think V V
best V 
and  
advise V V
me  
of  
the  
interest V V
generated V V
.  

I  
am V V
ready V V
to  
meet V V
there  
at  
your  
building  
or  
elsewhere  
that  
is V V
appropriate V V

No  
problem  
.  

Please  
,  
ask V V
Stinson  
as  
well  
.  

Vince  

I  
thought V V
that  
since  
Chonawee  
has V V
an  
optimization  
background  
,  
he  
would  
be V V
good V V
to  
have V V
him  
go V V
to  
dinner  
with  
Dr.  
Lasdon  
on  
Thrusday  
as  
well

Would  
this  
be V V
fine V V
?  

Thanks V V

We  
are V V
still  
trying V V
to  
figure V V

Once  
we

'll  
let V V
you

Are V V
there  
any  
new

We  
still  
have V V
the  
traders  
and  
books  
that  
you  
provided V V
last  
week  
,  
but  
need V V
to

there

any  
changes V V
to

Please  
let V V
us

head  
count V V

wedding V V

If  
you

could  
you  
possibly  
let V V
me  
know V V
of  
your

This  
is V V
a

And  
a

goes V V
to  
a

So

if  
you

,  
make V V
sure V V
it  
is V V
listed V V

Wei  
Ligang  
,  
a  
rising  
star  
of  
modern  
art  
in  
China  
,  
just  
had V V
an  
exhibition V V
in  
mid-July  
,  
2005  
in  
Hong  
Kong  
.  

He  
is V V
now  
lecturing V V
in  
USA  
.  

His  
art  
perfectly  
combines V V
painting V V
and  
Chinese  
calligraphy V 
.  

He  
is V V
regarded V V
as  
one  
of  
the  
leading  
Avant  
-  
Garde  
artist  
of  
modern  
calligraphy V 
.  

His  
artworks  
were V V
selected V V
and  
exhibited V V
in  
British  
Museum  
in  
2002  
.  

"  
Wei  
has V V
given V V
some  
virtuoso  
performances V V
with  
brush  
and  
ink  
,  
often  
incorporating V V
several  
different  
techniques  
into  
a  
single  
work V V
,  
"  
said V V
Gordon  
S.  
Barrass  
,  
curator  
of  
the  
exhibition V 
.  

In  
the  
world  
of  
"  
Wei  
's  
magic  
cubes  
,  
"  
all  
seem V V
to  
be V V
ingeniously  
planned V 
and  
tricky  
.  

All  
are V V
mathematical  
,  
all  
are V V
linguistic  
.  

In  
Wei  
's  
art  
,  
a  
logician  
could  
see V V
mathematical  
logic  
,  
a  
cellist  
could  
see V V
a  
ripple V 
of  
nine  
bass  
notes  
,  
a  
country  
girl  
could  
see V V
straw  
,  
and  
Harry  
Potter  
could  
see V V
two  
accompanied V V
green  
blazes V V
.  

"  
...  
to  
gaze V V
at  
Wei  
's  
art  
is V V
like  
entering V V
a  
floating  
world  
of

quickly

Google

it

Hello  
there  

Action  
Network  
is V V
a  
BBC  
website  
for  
people  
who  
are V V
taking V V
action V V
on  
issues V V
that  
concern V V
them  
.  

I  
'm V V
getting V V
in  
touch V V
because  
I  
think V V
it  
could  
be V V
useful V V
to  
people  
campaigning V V
about  
hospital  
closures  V
.  

We  
've V V
got V V
a  
page  
dedicated V V
to  
issues V V
around  
hospitals  
(  
http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/C55153  
)  
and  
a  
group  
called V V
NHS  
SOS  
have V V
already  
put V V
up  
a  
campaign V V
about  
ward  
closures  V
in  
Cumbria  
.  

I  
'm V V
hoping V V
to  
build V V
this  
up  
to  
be V V
a  
hub  
for  
all  
the  
campaigners  
-  
a  
place  
where  
people  
can  
exchange V V
ideas  
and  
advice  
.  

It  
would  
be V V
great V V
if  
the  
person  
from  
CHANT  
who  
started V V
this  
page  
would  
put V V
up  
a  
short  
description V V
of  
the  
campaign V V
and  
a  
list  
to  
this  
group  
page  
on  
the  
Action  
Network  
site  
.  

Action  
Network  
is V V
also  
a  
good  
place  
to  
post V V
details  
of  
events  
,  
or  
try V V
to  
rally V V
together  
a  
group  
if  
you  
want V V
to  
take V V
action V V
in  
your  
area  
.  

You  
can  
attach V V
anything  
you  
write V V
to  
pages  
for  
your  
local  
area  
,  
as  
well  
as  
to  
the  
'  
issue  V
'  
pages  
.  

I  
'm V V
more V 
than  
happy  V
to  
help V V
people  
with  
the  
site  
or  
answer V V
any  
questions V V
about  
Action  
Network  
-  
just  
drop V V
me  
a  
message  
.  

Otherwise  
,  
hope V V
to  
see V V
you  
there  
!

Winston  
Peters  
is V V
visiting V V
a  
school  
.  

In  
one  
class  
,  
he  
asks V V
the  
students  
if  
anyone  
can  
give V V
him  
an  
example  
of  
a  
"  
tragedy  
"

One  
little  
boy  
stands V V
up  
and  
offers V V
that  
,  
"  
if  
my  
best  
friend  
who  
lives V V
next  
door  
was V V
playing V V
in  
the  
street  
when  
a  
car  
came V V
along  
and  
killed V V
him  
,  
that  
would  
be V V
a  
tragedy  
"  
.  

"  
No  
,  
"  
Winston  
says V V
,  
"  
That  
would  
be V V
an  
ACCIDENT  
.  
"  

A  
girl  
raises V V
her  
hand  
.  

"  
If  
a  
school  
bus  
carrying V V
fifty  
children  
drove V V
off  
a  
cliff  
,  
killing V V
everyone  
involved  
...  
that  
would  
be V V
a  
tragedy  
"  
.  

"  
I  
'm V V
afraid V V
not  
,  
"  
explains V V
Winston  
,  
"  
that  
is V V
what  
we  
would  
call V V
a  
GREAT  
LOSS V V
.  
"  

The  
room  
is V V
silent  
,  
none  
of  
the  
other  
children  
volunteer V V
.  

"  
What  
?  
"  
asks V V
Winston  
,  
"  
is V V
n't  
there  
any  
one  
here  
who  
can  
give V V
me  
an  
example  
of  
a  
tragedy  
?  
"  

Finally  
,  
a  
boy  
in  
the  
back  
raises V V
his  
hand  
.  

In  
a  
timid  
voice V 
,  
he  
says V V
:  
"  
If  
an  
airplane  
carrying V V
Winston  
Peters  
was V V
blown V V
up  
by  
a  
bomb  
,  
THAT  
would  
be V V
a  
tragedy  
"  
.  

"  
Wonderful  
!  
"  
Winston  
beams V V
.  

"  
Marvelous  
!  

And  
can  
you  
tell V V
me  
WHY  
that  
would  
be V V
a  
tragedy  
?  
"  

"  
Well  
,  
"  
says V V
the  
boy  
,  
"  
because  
it  
would  
n't  
be V V
an  
accident  
,  
and  
it  
certainly  
would  
n't  
be V V
a

Wise

go V V

NASA

budget  
may  
be V V
kinda  
tight V V
to  
fund V V
a  
project  
like  
this  
.  

This  
group  
does V V
sound V V
pretty  
interesting V V
though  
.  

The  
Lunar  
Transporatation  
Systems  
(

actually  
being V V
funded V V
by  
two  
space  
businessmen  
,  
Walter  
Kistler

Bob  
Citron

Both  
of  
these

are V V
heavily  
involved V V
in  
the  
private  
sector  
of  
the  
space

,  
and  
both  
are V V
also  
involved V V
with  
another  
space  
company  
called V V
SPACEHAB  
.  

They  
want V V
to  
use V V
LTS  
to  
tie V V
into  
NASA  
's  
vision  
for  
Space

and  
seem V V
pleased V V
that  
the

is V V
moving V V
in  
that  
direction

"  
We  
are V V
so  
excited V V
that  
the  
White  
House  
and  
the  
recent  
new  
government  
space  
policy  
underscores V V
the  
need V V
to  
involve V V

develop V V

U.S.  
astronauts  
will  
launch V V
to  
the  
moon  
on  
sleek  
,  
single  
,  
shuttle  
booster  
rockets  
and  
the  
first  
new  
upper  
-  
stage  
rocket  
this  
country  
has V V
developed V V
in  
more  
than  
a  
decade  
,  
NASA  
and  
the  
Pentagon  
have V V
told V V
the  
White  
House  
.  

Lunar  
landers  
and  
other  
gear  
needed V V
for  
extended  
visits V V
to  
the  
moon  
will  
be V V
lofted V V
by  
gargantuan  
launchers  
as  
big  
as  
the  
Apollo  
-  
era  
Saturn  
5  
,  
the  
most  
powerful  
rockets  
ever  
flown V V
.  

It  
looks V V
as  
if  
NASA  
is V V
transitioning V V
away  
from  
the  
shuttle  
model  
,  
as  
in  
the  
past  
they  
have V V
proven V V
to  
be V V
quite  
dangerous V V
as  
Columbia  
has V V
recently  
proved V V
.  

Although  
these  
new  
rockets  
are V V
probably  
more  
expensive V V
,  
they  
will  
be V V
able V V
to  
go V V
at  
a  
much  
greater  
range  
than  
it's  
shuttle  
cousins  
,  
as  
they  
can  
not  
only  
break V V
free V V
from  
the  
atmosphere  
but  
reach V V
the  
moon  
as  
well  
.  

"  
NASA  
will  
initiate V V
development V V
of  
a  
Crew  
Launch V 
Vehicle  
derived V V
from  
space  
shuttle  
solid  
rocket  
boosters  
with  
a  
new  
upper  
stage  
for  
human  
spaceflight  V
,  
"  
said V V
the  
letter  
,  
signed V V
by  
NASA  
Administrator  
Mike  
Griffin  
and  
the  
Pentagon  
's  
top  
space  
official  
,  
ex-astronaut  
Ron  
Sega  
...  

"  
NASA  
then  
plans V V
to  
develop V V
a  
new  
100  
-  
metric  
-  
ton  
-  
class  
launch  
vehicle  
derived V V
from  
existing  
capabilities  
with  
the  
space  
shuttle  
external  
tanks  
and  
solid  
rocket  
boosters  
for  
future  
missions V V
to  
the  
moon  
,  
"  
the  
letter  
said V V
.  

NASA  
is V V
planning V V
on  
using V V
these  
new  
shuttles  
to  
replace V V
the  
current  
models V V
,  
with  
industry  
forecasters  
predicting V V
a  
launch V V
as  
early  
as  
2014  
.  

The  
new  
rocket  
design V V
will  
differ V V
slightly  
from  
it's  
predecessors  
,  
in  
the  
fact  
that  
the  
crew  
and  
cargo  
would  
launch V V
separately  
from  
two  
different  
rockets  
each  
and  
join V V
up  
in  
space  
later  
on  
.  

Launching V V
this

When

the  
end V V

the

Is V V

how  
many  
ounces  
in  
a

in  
ireland  
?  

Depends V V
of  
what  
.  

Ounces  
measure V V
weight  
,  
pints  
measure V V
volume  
.  

If  
you  
mean V V
fluid  
ounces  
,  
20  
,  
as  
opposed  V
to  
the  
16  
in  
America  
.  

An  
Irish  
pint  
is V V
larger V V
than  
a  
US  
one  
.  

20  
fluid  
ounces  
in  
a  
Pint  
in  
Ireland  

as  
R  
-  
G  
said V V
,  
there  
are V V
only  
16  
in  
an  
American  
one  
.  

Know V V
this  
well  
because  
I  
remember V V
an  
'  
irish  
'  
pub  
in  
the  
town  
in  
canada  
i  
grew V V
up  
in  
used V V
to  
advertise V V
the  
cheapest  
pints  
of  
guinness  
in  
town  
,  
but  
they  
served V V
them  
in  
american  
sized  
pints  
.  

That  
place  
did V V
n't  
stay V V
open V V
too  
long

help V V
finding V V
irish

i  
love V V
The

know V V
the  
re V 
from  
iraland  
.  

i  
would  
like V V
more  
bands  
like  
them  
pleasseee  

The  
thing  
about  
The  
Script  
is V V
they  
do V V
not  
sound V V
that  
Irish  
,  
I  
was V V
surprised V V
to  
hear V V
they  
were V V
from  
Dublin  
.  

Well  
if  
you  
are V V
interested V V
,  
I  
suggest V V
you  
have V V
a  
look V V
at  
General  
Fiasco  
,  
Two  
Door  
Cinema  
Club  
and  
Wallis  
Bird  
.  

I  
think V V
you  
will  
be V V
pleased V V
.  

I  
doubt V V
you  
will  
get V V
a  
sensible  
answer V V
in  
the  
"  
TRAVEL

section  
.  

*  
Ireland  

And  
there  
's V V
nothing  
distinctly  
Irish  
about  
them  
.  

You  
'd  
find V V
similar  
bands  
to  
them  
that  
are V V
from  
the  
UK  
and  
US  
.  

Women  
's  
rain  
coat  
...  
where  
can  
I  
find V V
one  
?  

I  
'm V V
going V V
on  
a  
trip V V
to  
Europe  
soon  
,  
and  
I  
need V V
to  
find V V
a  
good  
,  
quality  
raincoat  
.  

I  
've V V
looked V V
and  
looked V V
,  
but  
can  
not  
find V V
one  
anywhere  
!  

I  
would  
prefer V V
a  
simple  
,  
fitted  
black  
one  
.  

It  
actually  
needs V V
to  
be V V
relatively  
waterproof  
-  
the  
last  
one  
I  
bought V V
had V V
me  
soaked  V
in  
anything  
more  
than  
light  
/  
moderate  
rain  
.  

I  
'll  
pay V V
up  
to  
200  
-  
250  
for  
it  
if  
I  
have V V
to  
.  

Look V V
on  
the

in

You

there  
's V V
no  
such  
thing  
as  
"

in

That  
's V V
because  
of  
the

holds V V
the

it

My

threw V V
up  
yellow  
bile  
for  
two  
days  
but  
does V V
not  
have V V
dhirea  
.  

What  
should  
I  
do V V
?  

I  
've V V
tried V V
bland  
white  
rice  
but  
he  
wo  
nt  
eat V V
anything  
.  

What  
could  
it  
be V V
?  

Should  
I

concerned V V
?  

Call V V
a  
vet  
would  
be V V
a  
good  
idea  
with  
a  
sick  
dog  

VERY  
CONCERNED  
!!!  

plz  
bring V V
your  
dog  
to  
the  
vet  
ASAP  
!!!  

esp  
if  
not  
eating V V
-  
if  
it  
had V V
only  
happened V V
once  
and  
could  
get V V
him  
to  
eat V V
right  
away  
-  
it  
could  
have V V
been V V
you  
missed V V
his  
meal  
time  
and  
he  
needed V V
to  
eat V V
-  
since  
it  
sounds V V
like  
it  
has V V
happened V V
several  
times  
over  
two  
days  
-  
then  
he  
may  
have V V
gotten V V
int  
to  
something  
that  
needs V V
to  
be V V
attended V V
to  
RIGHT  
AWAY  
!!!  

or  
has V V
acquired V V
some  
type  
of  
disease  
and  
that  
too  
needs V V
to  
be V V
attended V V
to  
...  

why  
are V V
there  
two  
statues  
of  
David  
?  

i  
doing V V
a  
research  
paper  
on  
donatello  
and  
i  
notice V V
that  
there  
are V V
two  
statues  
of  
David  
,  
a  
bronze  
one  
and  
marble  
one  
.  

Michelangelo  
made V V
the  
marble  
one  
but  
why  
did V V
he  
do V V
another  
if  
Donatello  
had V V
already  
made V V
one  
?  

so  
i  
m V V
a  
little  
confused V V
,  
why  
is V V
there  
two  
statues  
of  
David  
?  

different  
generations  
,  
the  
donatello  
is V V
of  
a  
boy  
david  
as  
a  
young  
sheep  
Herder  
,  
the  
Michelangelo  
is V V
the  
grown  
up  
man  
david  
as  
slayer  
and  
king  

Because  
he  
liked V V
making V V
statues  
of  
David  
!  
:D  

Obviously  
,  
he  
should  
have V V
been V V
arrested V V
and  
jailed V V
-  
imagine V V
making V V
a  
statue  
or  
painting  V
on  
the  
same  
subject  
as  
another  
artist  
-  
clearly  
insulting  V
and  
disrespecting  V
-  
wasted  
time  
that  
could  
have V V
been V V
used V V
making V V
a  
statue  
with  
clothes  
on  
.  

Name  
of

n't  
quote V V
me  
on  
that  
.  

It's  
'  
gimmick  
'  
was V V
that  
you  
fill V V
your  
bowl  
cafeteria  
-  
style  
from  
raw  
ingredients  
and  
leave V V
it  
on  
the  
counter  
with  
a  
chopstick  
listing V V
your  
table  
number  
on  
it  
.  

Four  
guys  
around  
a  
large  
square  
open  
hibachi  
cook V V
your  
food  
,  
and  
when  
it  
's V V
finished V V
a  
server  
brings V V
it  
to  
your  
table  
.  

All  
-  
you  
can  
-  
eat V V
style  
deal V V
.  

It  
was V V
pretty  
epic  
as  
I  
remember V V
and  
would  
love V V
to  
send V V
my  
friend  
there  
.  

Any  
help V V

What  
's V V
the  
best  
time  
to  
start V V
a  
trip V V
around  
the  
world  
?  

Well  
,  
I  
'm V V
about  
to  
graduate V V
in  
less  
then  
a  
year  
,  
and  
I  
'm V V
planning V V
to  
study V V
medical  
school  
.  

But  
since  
in  
my  
country  
it  
lasts V V
for  
minimum  
6  
years  
,  
and  
I  
want V V
to  
go V V
aground  
the  
world  
,  
what  
do V V
you  
think V V
,  
should  
I  
do V V
it  
before  
or  
after  
medical  
school  
?  

If  
you  
can  
afford V V
to  
go V V
before  
,  
then  
by  
all  
means  
,  
GO V V
.  

If  
you  
have V V
to  
wait V V
,  
due  
to  
financial  
reasons  
,  
then  
wait V V
.  

I  
would  
much  
rather  
put V V
it  
off  
until  
I  
can  
afford V V
to  
have V V
the  
vacation V V
of  
a  
lifetime  
as  
I  
'm V V
sure V V
this  
trip V V
is V V
intended V V
to  
be V V
.  

Airfare  
alone  
will  
be V V
incredibly  
expensive V V
so  
make V V
sure V V
you  
have V V
the  
money  
and  
of  
course  
free  
time  
to  
take V V
your  
time  
and  
have V V
a  
great  
time  
.  

canon

stops V V
working V V
?  

My  
canon  
t2i  
stops V V
working V V
at  
times  
as  
in  
the  
power  
bottom  
is V V
switched V V
to  
"  
on  
"  
but  
the  
camera  
does V V
not  
respond V V
to  
any  
function V V
.  

the  
camera  
only  
begins V V
to  
work V V
again  
when  
i  
take V V
out  
the  
battery  
and  
put V V
it  
back  
in  
.  

did V V
anyone  
have V V
this  
issue V V
?  

is V V
it  
worthy V V
to  
send V V
in  
for  
warranty  
repair V V
?  

thanks V V
!  

Sounds V V
simple V V
enough V 
to  
me  
.  

Your  
camera  
is V V
n't  
acting V V
normally  
,  
you  
got V V
warranty  
,  
let V V
Canon  
deal V V
with  
it  
.  

I  
would  
agree V V
.  

I  
shoot V V
a  
t1i  
and  
have V V
n't  
had V V
such  
an  
issue V V
.  

I  
also  
agree V V
it  
's V V
under  
warranty  
so  
get V V
in  
touch V V
with  
Canon  
.  

It  
sounds V V
like  
a  
firmware  
issue V V
and  
the  
camera  
requires V V
a  
re-boot  
just  
like  
what  
happens V V
in  
a  
computer  
-  
needs V V
a  
re-start  V
from  
time  
to  
time  
but  
it  
should  
n't  
be V V
happening V V
in  
a  
camera  
.

on  
the  
Metra  
system  
or  
the

great  
way V V

without  
spending V V
a  
fortune

face  
to  
try V V

to  
make V V
convo V 
,  
it  
's V V

,  
so  
if

I  
decided V V
to  
get V V
a  
150  
gal  
aquarium  
,  
what  
can  
I  
fill V V
it  
with  
?  

I  
was V V
thinking V V
cichlids  
?  

Possibly  
a  
freshwater  
tank  
with  
a  
ton  
of  
different  
species  
in  
there  
.  

I  
've V V
never  
kept V V
cichlids  
though  
.  

I  
know V V
saltwater  
is V V
a  
possibility  
,  
can  
you  
give V V
me  
a  
possible  
stocking  
option  
for  
that  
too  
?  

I  
'll  
choose V V
the  
one  
that  
sounds V V
the  
best  
after  
looking V V
into  
all  
the  
fish  
:)  

Here  
is V V
the  
stocking V 
for  
my  
150  
gallon  
tank  
i  
upgraded V V
it  
to  
200  
at  
the  
weekend  
because  
of  
the  
clownloach  
A  
200  
gallon  
with  
6  
pairs  
of  
Breeding  
Angel  
fish  
fire  
mouth  
honey  
Gouramis  
5  
8  
inch  
clownloach  
a  
Krib

1  
inch  
clown  
loach  
with  
16  
cory  
cats  
5  
Australian  
Rainbows  

If  
you  
took V V
out  
the  
clown  
loach  
it  
would  
make V V
a  
nice  
150  
gallon  
tank  
.  

fill V V
it  
with  
water  
:)  
lol  

for  
a  
tank

size  
i  
would  
suggest V V

Best  
Electrician  
in  
Florence  

I  
have V V
been V V
using V V
Steele  
Electric  
for  
years

They  
have V V
always  
done V V
a

job  
at  
a  
reasonable  
price V V
.  

Highly  
recommended V V

Not  
impressed  V

Overpriced  
and  
the  
doctor  
acted V V
arrogant V 
and  
rushed V V
at  
a  
time  
when  
there  
was V V
very  
few  
clients  
in  
the  
facility

I  
wo  
n't  
return V V
.  

A  
thoroughly  
comprehensive  
service V V
;  
excellent  
communication V V
and  
best  
of  
they  
are V V
transparent V 
with  
their  
fee  
(  
ie  
nothing  
is V V
simply  
implied V V
or  
assumed V V
)  
.  

I  
gave V V
Dr.  
Rohatgi  
2  
stars  
because  
her  
assistant  
was V V
very  
pleasant V V
.  

However  
,  
I  
did V V
not  
find V V
her  
very  
helpful V V
and  
her  
receptionist  
was V V
rude V V

Extremely

Hit V V

Pretty

great

The

This  
is V V
by

the  
best

The

gets V V
busy V V
but  
you  
never  
have V V
to  
wait V V
long  
because  
they  
ARE V V
orginizied  V
,  
so  
you  
are V V
in  
,  
out

and  
paid V V
well

is V V
easy V V
to  
use V V
and  
it  
keeps V V
the  
cold  
out  
during  
the  
winter  
.  

The  
sales  
staff  
and  
the  
installation  
staff  
were V V
all  
easy V V
to  
get V V
along  
with  
.  

I  
highly  
recommend V V
Garage  
Pros  
to  
my  
friends  
.  

umm  
...  

okay  
,  
I  
do V V
nt  
have V V
a  
review V V
,  
but  
why  
in  
the  
hell  
would  
you  
name V V
your  
business  
something  
that  
has V V
the  
initials  
KKK  
....  
is V V
there  
something  
behind  
the  
scenes  
at  
this  
place  
?  

Like  
I  
'm V V
legitimately  
concerned V V
at  
this  
point  
...  
lol  

Fresh  
and  
Excellent  
Quality  

We  
order V V
take  
out  
from  
here  
all  
the  
time  
and  
we  
are V V
never  
disappointed  V
.  

The  
food  
is V V
always  
fresh V V
and  
delicious V V
.  

It  
can  
be V V
a  
little  
on  
the  
spicy  
side  
but  
just  
ask V V
them  
exactly  
what  
you  
want V V
and  
they  
are V V
very  
helpful V V
.  

I  
really  
want V V
to  
like V V
this  
place  
since  
I  
work V V
right  
around  
the  
corner  
.  

Unfortunately  
,  
I  
've V V
given V V
it  
a  
couple  
of  
tries V V
at  
different  
times  
and  
decided V V
to  
stop V V
going V V
.  

The  
employees  
do V V
n't  
really  
seem V V
to  
enjoy V V
what  
they  
are V V
doing V V
and  
it  
shows V V
.  

Class  
act  
.  

It  
was V V
late V V
in  
the  
day  
and  
I  
was V V
worried V V
I  
would  
get V V
charged V V
an  
arm  
and  
a  
leg  
and  
have V V
to  
wait V V
forever  
.  

They  
picked V V
my  
car  
up  
in  
Yarmouth  
and  
towed V V
to  
Bath  
for  
a  
great  
price V V
.  

Would  
do V V
business  
with  
them  
again  
.

Do V V
n't  
judge V V
a  
book  
by  
its

From

like  
it

This  
could

The

amazing V V

the

They  
walked V V
me  
through  
all  
the

that  
there  
were V V
no

slow  
service V V

I  
used V V
to  
take V V
my  
cars  
there  
all  
the  
time  
,  
but  
management V V
changes V V
hands  
too  
frequently  
,  
the  
service V V
has V V
been V V
slow V V
,  
and  
they  
often  
try V V
to  
"  
add V V
on  
"  
extra  
services V V
,  
which  
sometimes  
is V V
not  
needed V V

I  
do V V
nt  
go V V
there  
anymore

this

not

hopefully  
you

Which  
should  
be V V
a  
private  
issue V V

I  
hired V V
this  
company  
to  
unlock V V
my  
car  
.  

The  
price V V
they  
gave V V
was V V
good V V
so  
I  
said V V
hey  
this  
seems V V
great V V
.  

After  
they  
showed V V
up  
there  
was V V
a  
little  
trouble  
to  
get V V
my  
car  
unlocked V V
,  
it  
took V V
quite  
a  
bit  
of  
time

the  
job  
was V V
well  
done  V

Eric  
came V V
by  
as  
scheduled V V
today  
and  
sprayed V V
our  
house

He  
seemed V V
to  
understand V V
how

it  
was V V
for  
us  
to  
make V V
sure V V
the  
whole

was V V
sprayed V V
so  
he  
took V V
his

My  
favorite  
place  
...  

My  
daughter  
and  
I  
stayed V V
here  
again  
from  
the  
7th  
to  
the  
14th  
of  
December  
.  

yet  
again  
it  
was V V
a  
great  
stay V V
from  
begiinning V V
to  
end V V
.  

Okay  
our  
room  
was V V
at  
times  
noisy  
but  
we  
were V V
in  
a  
mega  
busy  
city  
at  
an  
extremely  
busy  
time  
of  
year  
.  

A  
Definite  
No  

Incompetent  
servers  
,  
kitchen  
and  
management V V
.  

Expect V V
either  
undercooked  
or  
mushy  
food  
and  
lackluster  
service V V
.  

The  
investors  
put V V
big  
bucks  
into  
the  
building  
but  
are V V
clueless V 
about  
what  
makes V V
a  
good  
dining V 
or  
bar  
experience V V
.  

Even  
the  
least  
discriminating  
diner  
would  
know V V
not  
to  
eat V V
at  
Sprecher

Wonderful  
Atmosphere  

I  
have V V
been V V
going V V

Believe V V
it

not

the

most  
helpful V V
to  
my

my

we  
could  
not  
have V V
been V V
happier V V

We  
went V V
through  
six  
photographers  
to  
find V V
the  
right  
photographers  
that  
would  
represent V V
our  
firm  
in  
the  
light  
we  
wished V V
to  
and  
Michael  
and  
his

made V V
that  
happen V V

He  
's V V
worth V V
every

Average  
food  
and  
deathly  
slow  
service V V

I  
have V V
eaten V V
here  
several  
times  
and  
every  
time  
the  
service V V
is V V
slower V V
than  
slow  
.  

One  
time  
we  
even  
left V V
after  
sitting V V
at  
the  
table  
for  
20  
minutes  
and  
not  
being V V
greeted V V
with  
a

Ridiculous

the

was V V
so

I  
get V V
that  
careless  
teenager  
kind  
of  
treatment V V
from  
some  
of  
their

perhaps  
they  
should  
hire V V
more  
serious  
adults  
to  
help V V
serve V V

cook V V

The  
Donuts

very  
over  
proofed

making V V
them  
stale

bready  V

The  
service V V

fast V V

this  
just  
does V V
nt  
make V V
up  
for  
the

product

We  
tried V V
4  
different

they  
were V V
all  
the
