From  
the  
AP  
comes V V
this  
story  
:  

President  
Bush  
on  
Tuesday  
nominated V V
two  
individuals  
to  
replace V V
retiring  
jurists  
on  
federal  
courts  
in  
the  
Washington  
area  
.  

Bush  
nominated V V
Jennifer  
M.  
Anderson  
for  
a  
15  
-  
year  
term  
as  
associate  
judge  
of  
the  
Superior  
Court  
of  
the  
District  
of  
Columbia  
,  
replacing V V
Steffen  
W.  
Graae  
.  

***  

Bush  
also  
nominated V V
A.  
Noel  
Anketell  
Kramer  
for  
a  
15  
-  
year  
term  
as  
associate  
judge  
of  
the  
District  
of  
Columbia  
Court  
of  
Appeals  
,  
replacing V V
John  
Montague  
Steadman  
.  

The  
sheikh  
in  
wheel  
-  
chair  
has V V
been V V
attacked V V
with  
a  
F  
-  
16  
-  
launched  V
bomb  
.  

He  
could  
be V V
killed V V
years  
ago  
and  
the  
israelians  
have V V
all  
the  
reasons  
,  
since  
he  
founded V V
and  
he  
is V V
the  
spiritual  
leader  
of  
Hamas  
,  
but  
they  
did V V
n't  
.  

Today  
's  
incident  
proves V V
that  
Sharon  
has V V
lost V V
his  
patience  
and  
his  
hope V V
in  
peace V V
.  

Nervous  
people  
make V V
mistakes V V
,  
so  
I  
suppose V V
there  
will  
be V V
a  
wave V V
of  
succesfull  
arab  
attacks V V
.  

A  
la  
guerre  
c'est  
comme  V
a  
la  
guerre  
!  

In  
the  
eastern  
city  
of  
Baqubah  
,  
guerrillas  
detonated V V
a  
car  
bomb  
outside  
a  
police  
station  
,  
killing V V
several  
people  
.  

The  
US  
lost V V
yet  
another  
helicopter  
to  
hostile  
fire V V
near  
Habbaniyah  
in  
the  
Sunni  
heartland  
,  
but  
this  
time  
the  
crew  
was V V
safe V V
.  

In  
Fallujah  
,  
hundreds  
of  
demonstrators  
came V V
out  
against  
US  
troops  
when  
they  
briefly  
arrested V V
a  
yound  
newlywed  
bride  
.  

(  
I  
hope V V
that  
the  
US  
army  
got V V
an  
enormous  
amount  
of  
information  
from  
her  
relatives  
,  
because  
otherwise  
this  
move V V
was V V
a  
bad  
,  
bad  
tradeoff V V
)  
.  

The  
US  
troops  
fired V V
into  
the  
hostile  
crowd  
,  
killing V V
4  
.  

It  
seems V V
clear V V
to  
me  
that  
the  
manhunt  
for  
high  
Baath  
officials  
in  
the  
Sunni  
heartland  
is V V
being V V
done V V
wrong  V
,  
or  
at  
least  
in  
ways V V
that  
are V V
bad V V
for  
US  
standing  
with  
local  
Iraqis  
.  

Google  
has V V
finally  
had V V
an  
analyst  
day  
--  
a  
chance V V
to  
present V V
the  
company  
's  
story  
to  
the  
(  
miniscule  
number  
of  
)  
people  
who  
have V V
n't  
heard V V
it  
.  

Usually  
,  
these  
are V V
just  
a  
chance V V
for  
the  
suckups  
to  
suck V V
up  
,  
but  
this  
time  
people  
are V V
actually  
concerned V V
about  
the  
company  
's  
plans V V
.  

They  
work V V
on  
Wall  
Street  
,  
after  
all  
,  
so  
when  
they  
hear V V
a  
company  
who's  
stated  V
goals  
include V V
"  
Do V V
n't  
be V V
evil V V
,  
"  
they  
imagine V V
a  
company  
who's  
eventually  
history  
will  
be V V
"  
Do V V
n't  
be V V
profitable  V
.  
"  

It  
's V V
not  
quite  
as  
freewheeling  
an  
environment  
as  
you  
'd  
imagine V V
:  
Sergey  
Brin  
has V V
actually  
created V V
a  
mathematical  
'  
proof V 
'  
that  
the  
company  
's  
self  
-  
driven  
research  
strategy  
,  
which  
gives V V
employees  
one  
day  
a  
week  
to  
do V V
research  V
projects  
on  
their  
own  
,  
is V V
a  
good  
,  
respectable  
idea  
.  

Read V V
the  
entire  
article  
;  
there  
's V V
a  
punchline  
,  
too  
.  

My  
opinion  
piece  
on  
the  
implications V V
of  
Arafat  
's  
passing V V
for  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
has V V
appeared V V
at  
Newsday  
.  

Excerpt  
:  

"  
Arafat  
's  
secular  
nationalism  
was V V
supple V 
enough V 
to  
compromise V V
with  
Israel  
and  
to  
imagine V V
a  
two  
-  
state  
solution V V
,  
even  
if  
the  
road  
of  
negotiations V V
remained V V
rocky  
.  

The  
continued  
Israeli  
colonization V V
of  
the  
occupied  
Palestinian  
territories  
during  
the  
1990s  
helped V V
,  
along  
with  
terrorist  
attacks V V
by  
radical  
groups  
such  
as  
Hamas  
,  
to  
derail V V
the  
peace  
process V V
,  
which  
Sharon  
had V V
always  
opposed V V
.  

Arafat  
's  
death V V
creates V V
a  
vacuum  
in  
Palestinian  
leadership V V
that  
will  
not  
soon  
be V V
filled V V
.  

Sharon  
's  
assassination V V
of  
major  
Hamas  
leaders  
has V V
also  
weakened V V
authority  
structures  
in  
that  
party  
.  

If  
the  
Israelis  
and  
the  
Palestinian  
leadership V V
can  
not  
find V V
a  
way V V
to  
reinvigorate V V
the  
peace  
process V V
,  
cells  
of  
radical  
young  
Palestinians  
may  
grow V V
up  
that  
look V V
to  
bin  
Laden  
for  
their  
cues  V
.  

Even  
if  
local  
Palestinian  
leaders  
remain V V
strong V V
enough V V
to  
keep V V
al  
-  
Qaida  
out  
,  
the  
festering V 
Israeli  
-  
Palestinian  
struggle V V
remains V V
among  
the  
best  
recruiting  
posters  
for  
al  
-  
Qaida  
with  
young  
Muslim  
men  
.  

Resolving V V
this  
conflict V V
would  
be V V
the  
most  
effective  
weapon  
the  
United  
States  
could  
deploy V V
in  
its  
war V V
on  
terror

Xinhua  
reports V V
that  
a  
wide  
range  
of  
Iraqi  
political  
forces  
on  
Tuesday  
condemned V V
Sharon  
's  
murder V V
of  
Sheikh  
Ahmed  
Yassin

a

leader

reports V V
that  
Fallujah  
was V V
closed V V
Tuesday  
in  
a  
general  
strike V V
.  

US  
troops  
there  
clashed V V
with  
guerrillas  
in  
a  
fight V V
that  
left V V
one  
Iraqi  
dead  
.  

In  
Ramadi  
,  
there  
was V V
a  
big  
demonstration V V
.  

Radical  
Shiite  
cleric  
Muqtada  
al  
-  
Sadr  
said V V
the  
attack V V
was V V
"  
criminal  
"  
and  
that  
"  
the  
Zionists

The  
interim  
Governing  
Council  
issued V V
a  
communique

"  
It  
is V V
a

This

only  
consolidate V V
the

acts

would  
not  
bring V V
peace V V

the  
message  
claimed V V

alleged V V
that

who  
suffer V V
the  
American  
occupation V V

relate V V
their  
case V V

that  
of

Palestinian  
people

under  
the  
Israeli  
occupation V V

"  

In  
an  
apparently  
unrelated  
incidents  
,  
some  
eleven  
Iraqis  
were V V
killed V V
by  
snipers

Tuesday

a  
group

trainees  
in  
a

two

Ever  
since  
the  
first  
whispers  V
about  
Google  
's  
IPO  
,  
most  
investors  
have V V
feared V V
that  
the  
stock  
would  
come V V
public  
at  
such  
a  
ridiculously  
high  
price V V
that  
,  
even  
with  
a  
spectacularly  
profitable  
business  
model V 
and  
some  
nearly  
flawless  
execution V V
,  
the  
price V V
would  
be V V
too  
high V V
for  
investors  
to  
make V V
a  
real  
profit V V
.  

We  
've V V
moved V V
on

We  
've V V
grown V V
up

Now  
,  
people  
wonder V V
if  
Google  
can  
even  
survive V V
.  

That  
's V V
overstating V V
it  
,  
I  
know V V
.  

What  
they  
wonder V V
is V V
whether  
Google  
can  
be V V
anything  
more  
than  
what  
it

always  
been V V

some  
real  
grass  
-  
roots  
support V V
,  
successful  
by  
the  
grace  
of  
simplicity

Simplicity  
gave V V
it  
that  
blessed  
,  
laudatory  
lack V V
of  
clutter  
,  
the  
efficient  
and  
effective  
text

ads  
,  
and  
the  
support V V
of  
anyone

The  
problem  
is V V
that  
customers  
attracted V V
by  
a  
simple  
interface  
are V V
among  
the  
least  
loyal  
you

The  
other  
problem  
?  

It  
's V V
tough V V
to  
make V V
money  
branching V V
out  
when  
your  
appeal V 
is V V
in  
your  
focus  
.  

As  
the  
survey V V
cited V V
in  
the  
above  
-  
linked V V
article  
shows V V
,  
most  
Google  
users  
do V V
n't  
intend V V
to

Google  
is V V

AOL

If  
they  
continue V V
to  
add V V
features  
so  
they  
can  
justify V V
their  
likely  
sky  
-  
high  
valuation  V
,  
Google  
risks V V
losing V V
a  
huge  
chunk

the  
next  
keep V

Remember V V
when  
a  
whole  
lot  
of  
people  
had V V
to  
die V V
because  
a  
Swedish  
newspaper  
printed V V
those  
cartoons  
of  
the  
Prophet  
Mohammed  
?  

Now  
Iran  
wants V V
to  
turn V V
the  
tables  
and  
is V V
inviting V V
cartoonists  
to  
do V V
their  
best  
by  
depicting V V
the  
Holocaust  
.  

Amazingly  
,  
these  
idiots  
think V V
a  
cartoon  
of  
Mohammed  
is V V
comparable V V
to  
what  
we  
can  
expect V V
in  
this  
new  
fun  
contest V V
:  

TEHRAN  
(  
AFP  
)  
-  

An  
international  
contest V V
of  
cartoons  
on  
the  
Holocaust  
opened V V
in  
Tehran  
in  
response V V
to  
the  
publication V V
in  
Western  
papers  
last  
September  
of  
caricatures  
of  
the  
Prophet  
Mohammed  
.  

"  
We  
staged V V
this  
fair  V
to  
explore V V
the  
limits V V
of  
freedom  
Westerners  
believe V V
in  
,

Masoud  
Shojai  
,  
head  
of  
the  
country

Iran  
Cartoon  
"  
association  
and  
the  
fair  
organizer  
,  
said V V
.  

"  
They  
can  
freely  
write V V
anything  
they  
like V V
about  
our  
prophet  
,  
but  
if  
one  
raises V V
doubts V V
about  
the  
Holocaust  
he  
is V V
either  
fined V V
or  
sent V V
to  
prison  
,  
"  
he  
added V V
.  

"  
Though  
we  
do V V
not  
deny V V
that  
fact  
that  
Jews  
were V V
killed V V
in  
the  
(  
second  
world  
)  
war  V
,  
why  
should  
the  
Palestinians  
pay V V
for  
it  
?  
"  

Shojai  
told V V
the  
opening  
ceremony  
of  
the  
month  
-  
long  
fair  
in  
Tehran  
's  
Palestine  
Contemporary  
Art  
Museum  
.  

He  
added V V
that  
around  
1,100  
cartoons  
were V V
submitted V V
by  
participants  
from  
more  
than  
60  
countries  
and  
that  
more  
than  
200  
are V V
on  
show V V
.  

He  
said V V
the  
top  
three  
cartoons  
will  
be V V
announced V V
on  
September  
2  
,  
with  
the  
winners  
being V V
awarded V V
prizes  
of  
12,000  
,  
8,000  
and  
5,000  
dollars  
respectively  
.  

This  
cute  
little  
stunt V 
is V V
only  
going V V
to  
prove V V
just  
how  
fanatic  
the  
extremist  
Muslims  
are V V
.  

When  
they  
saw V V
a  
cartoon  
of  
their  
prophet  
,  
people  
had V V
to  
die V V
.  

When  
their  
precious  
cartoons  
are V V
released V V
I  
highly  
doubt V V
it  
will  
look V V
like  
the  
end V V
of  
the  
world  
.  

US  
Marines  
moved V V
into  
most  
of  
Fallujah  
on  
Wednesday  
,  
though  
they  
were V V
still  
meeting V V
pockets  
of  
resistance V V
.  

The  
Fallujah  
fighting V V
has V V
killed V V

northern  
Iraqi  
cities  
on  
Wednesday  
,  
leaving V V
some  
22  
persons  
dead  
in  
Mosul  
,  
Baiji  
,  
and  
Tuz  
.  

Hundreds  
of  
persons  
mounted V V
demonstrations V V
against  
the  
Fallujah  
campaign V V
in  
Tikrit  
and  
Huwaijah  
,  
as  
well  
,  
according  
to  
az  
-  
Zaman  
.  

The  
battles V V
and  
demonstrations V V
were V V
provoked V V
by  
the  
US  
assault V V
on  
Fallujah  
.  

Guerrillas  
threatened V V
to  
assassinate V V
Prime  
Minister  
Iyad  
Allawi  
and  
Minister  
of  
Defense  
Hazem  
Shaalan  
in  
retaliation V V
for  
the  
attack V V
.  

Allawi  
's  
aged  
cousin  
and  
the  
man  
's  
wife  
and  
daughter  
-  
in  
-  
law  
were V V
abducted V V
and  
guerrillas  
threaten V V
to  
behead V V
them  
if  
the  
Fallujah  
compaign  V
is V V
not  
stopped V V
.  

In  
Iraqi  
society  
,  
PM  
Allawi  
is V V
responsible V V
for  
protecting V V
his  
clan  
,  
including  
especially  
his  
first  
cousins  
,  
so  
this  
kidnapping V V
makes V V
him  
look V V
weak V V
and  
brings V V
substantial  
shame V V
on  
him  
.  

The  
US  
Marines  
took V V
most  
of  
Fallujah  
Wednesday  
,  
but  
still  
face V V
pockets  
of  
resistance V V
.  

If  
Samarra  
and  
other  
cities  
are V V
any  
guide  
,  
those  
pockets  
of  
resistance V V
could  
go V V
on  
bedeviling V V
the  
US  
for  
some  
time  
to  
come V V
.  

The  
intrepid  
Ed  
Wong  
of  
the  
NYT  
has V V
more  
on  
the  
Sunni  
boycott V 
of  
the  
elections V V
.  

He  
reports V V
that  
the  
Iraqi  
Islamic  
Party  
,  
which  
had V V
earlier  
been V V
absolutely  
committed V V
to  
getting V V
out  
the  
Sunni  
vote V V
,  
is V V
now  
wavering V V
and  
saying V V
their  
position  
will  
depend V V
on  
the  
situation  
.  

The  
outbreak V V
of  
demonstrations V V
and  
violence  
throughout  
the  
Sunni  
Arab  
regions  
on  
Wednesday  
did V V
not  
bode V V
well  
for  
Sunni  
participation V V
in  
the  
January  
elections V V
.  

Jim  
Lobe  
has V V
more  
on  
the  
political  
implications V V
of  
the  
Fallujah  
assault V V
,  
both  
in  
Iraq  
and  
in  
Washington

some  
black  
satire

Fallujah

The  
hottest  
item  
on  
Christmas  
wish  
lists  
this  
year  
is V V
nuclear  
weapons  
.  

Al  
-  
Qaeda  
wants V V
them  
,  
Iran  
wants V V
them  
,  
Russia  
wants V V
the  
better  
ones  
,  
and  
all  
the  
US  
wants V V
is V V
to  
give V V
them  
all  
a  
piece  
of  
coal  
.  

For  
the  
last  
few  
years  
there  
have V V
been V V
tensions V V
with  
Iran  
’s  
nuclear  
program  
with  
word  
coming V V
this  
week  
that  
a  
deal V V
was V V
reached V V
through  
the  
European  
Union  
that  
meets V V
with  
the  
approval V V
of  
the  
International  
Atomic  
Energy  
Agency  
.  

At  
the  
same  
time  
,  
an  
Iranian  
Opposition  
Group  
released V V
what  
they  
call V V
proof V V
of  
a  
covert  
nuclear  
weapons  
program  
.  

Arial  
photos V V
,  
loose  
connections V V
to  
AQ  
Kahn  
and  
Libya  
make V V
up  
the  
evidence  
that  
the  
group  
presented V V
.  

Russia  
also  
announced V V
that  
it  
was V V
seeking V V
and  
building V V
the  
best  
nukes  
the  
world  
’s V 
ever  
seen V V
.  

President  
Vladimir  
Putin  
said V V
Russia  
is  V
will  
have V V
new  
nuclear  
weapons  
that  
other  
countries  
do V V
not  
and  
will  
not  
have V V
.  

With  
the  
demand V V
so  
high V V
,  
the  
question V V
arises V V
on  
to  
who  
should  
be V V
or  
has V V
the  
right V V
to  
be V V
the  
Santa  
of  
nuclear  
weapons  
.  

Right  
now  
that  
seems V V
to  
be V V
the  
US  
,  
EU  
,  
and  
IAEA  
.  

But  
not  
always  
do V V
those  
three  
agree V V
,  
and  
not  
always  
are V V
their  
decisions V V
equal V V
.  

The  
US  
has V V
strongly  
opposed V V
a  
nuclear  
weapons  
program  
of  
Iran  
,  
yet  
Israel  
,  
which  
to  
this  
day  
has V V
never  
officially  
said V V
that  
they  
posses V V
nuclear  
weapons  
,  
ranks V V
around  
fifth  
in  
nuclear  
strength  
.  

It  
is V V
estimated V V
that  
Israel  
has V V
over  
200  
nuclear  
weapons  
yet  
neither  
the  
US  
nor  
any  
of  
her  
allies  
expresses V V
the  
slightest  
concern V V
.  

North  
Korea  
’s  
Kim  
Jong  
Ill  
also  
has V V
the  
bomb  
at  
the  
top  
of  
his  
list  
and  
Santa  
seems V V
to  
have V V
already  
come V V
a  
few  
years  
ago  
.  

It  
is V V
rumored V V
that  
North  
Korea  
has V V
at  
least  
a  
couple  
nuclear  
weapons  
.  

But  
getting V V
past  
who  
should  
get V V
them  
,  
is V V
who  
has V V
them  
,  
and  
who  
is V V
really  
close V V
.  

The  
case V V
against  
Iran  
has V V
a  
feeling V V
of  
Déjà  
vu  
.  

Arial  
photos V V
of  
the  
lab  
were V V
uranium  
is V V
being V V
enriched V V
,  
somewhat  
like  
those  
of  
chemical  
weapons  
stockpiles  
in  
Iraq  
.  

America  
cried V V
wolf  
in  
Iraq  
,  
and  
what  
’s V 
scary V V
is V V
that  
sooner  
or  
later  
,  
that  
wolf  
will  
probably  
get V V
us  
.  

I  
ran V V
across  
this  
item  
on  
the  
Internet  
.  

Sooooo  
.  

The  
United  
States  
goes V V
into  
a  
war  
zone  
and  
evacuates V V
a  
bunch  
of  
U.S.  
citizens  
(  
most  
of  
whom  
were V V
"  
dual  
-  
citizens  
"  
)  
.  

Then  
,  
eschewing V V
normal  
procedure V V
,  
the  
Department  
of  
State  
waived V V
the  
fees  
that  
they  
charge V V
for  
evacuating V V
U.S.  
citizen  
.  

Why  
?  

To  
pander V V
to  
the  
mythical  
"  
Arab  
street  
"  
,  
of  
course  
.  

Now  
,  
I  
would  
argue V V
that  
one  
could  
have V V
reasonably  
predicted V V
that  
some  
form  
of  
military  
violence  
was V V
likely V V
to  
occur V V
in  
Lebanon  
(  
considering V V
that  
the  
country  
has V V
been V V
experiencing V V
some  
form  
of  
conflict V V
for  
approximately  
the  
last  
32  
years  
)  
.  

In  
other  
words  
,  
those  
Americans  
were V V
there  
by  
their  
own  
choice V V
,  
mired V V
in  
a  
situation  
that  
was V V
totally  
predictable V V
.  

Yet  
we  
did V V
n't  
charge V V
them  
for  
the  
evacuation V V
.  

This  
is V V
unlike  
the  
situation  
last  
year  
in  
Asia  
when  
we  
evacuated V V
U.S.  
citizens  
from  
areas  
that  
were V V
hit V V
by  
the  
tsunami V V
-  
a  
phenomenon  
that  
is V V
much  
less  
predictable V 
than  
the  
Hezbollah  
-  
provoked  V
destruction V V
that  
rained V V
down  
on  
Lebanon  
.  

And  
what  
do V V
we  
get V V
for  
this  
effort V V
?  

A  
lawsuit  
.  

That  
's V V
right V V
,  
folks  
.  

The  
American  
-  
Arab  
Discrimination  
Committee  
is V V
suing V V
Condoleeza  
Rice  
and  
Donald  
Rumsfeld  
,  
charging V V
that  
they  
mismanaged V V
the  
evacuation  
efforts V V
.  

Here  
's V V
an  
excerpt  
from  
the  
article  
:  

Nina  
Chahine  
,  
19  
,  
who  
with  
her  
family  
was V V
among  
the  
named  
plaintiffs  
in  
the  
lawsuit  
,  
said V V
her  
wedding V V
in  
the  
southern  
city  
of  
Tyre  
was V V
set V V
for  
July  
13  
.  

The  
wedding V V
had V V
to  
be V V
postponed V V
as  
family  
members  
fled V V
the  
outbreak V V
of  
the  
war V V
,  
she  
said V V
.  

"  
We  
were V V
on  
the  
road  
and  
the  
first  
bridge  
was V V
bombed V V
and  
we  
drove V V
home  
and  
all  
the  
other  
bridges  
were V V
bombed V V
and  
there  
was V V
absolutely  
no  
way V V
for  
us  
to  
get V V
home  
,  
"  
Chahine  
told V V
reporters  
outside  
federal  
court  
in  
Detroit  
.  

"  
We  
were V V
all  
American  
citizens  
and  
there  
was V V
no  
way V V
that  
anybody  
helped V V
us  
.  

No  
communications V V
nothing  
.  

I  
was V V
on  
my  
way V V
to  
my  
wedding V V
fearing V V
death V V
,  
basically  
.  
"  

Chahine  
said V V
her  
immediate  
family  
spent V V
about  
$  
20,000  
to  
return V V
to  
Detroit  
via  
Syria  
and  
Jordan  
.  

Dear  
Nina  
,  

Here  
's V V
a  
tip V V
:  
Do V V
n't  
get V V
married V V
in  
countries  
that  
house V V
illegal  
militias  
that  
attack V V
other  
countries  
and  
hence  
are V V
likely V V
to  
come V V
under  
counter-attack  V
!  

Crap  
like  
this  
sure  
makes V V
me  
want V V
to  
rush V V
right  
out  
and  
rescue V V
people  
from  
dilemmas  
of  
their  
own  
making V V
.  

Though  
I  
am V V
loathe  V
to  
quote V V
other  
writers  
at  
legnth  
in  
this  
space  
,  
this  
little  
bit  
from  
Dan  
Froomkin  
's  
"  
White  
House  
Briefing  
"  
column  
in  
the  
WashPost  
today  
is V V
just  
too  
good V V
to  
pass V V
up  
(  
read V V
the  
whole  
column  
here  
)  
:  

At  
the  
Ask V V
the  
President  
event  
on  
Friday  
,  
one  
of  
the  
questions V V
was V V
about  
whether  
Bush  
has V V
any  
thoughts V V
about  
his  
memoirs  
.  

This  
is V V
one  
example  
of  
what  
happens V V
when  
Bush  
gets V V
a  
question V V
that  
he  
has V V
n't  
anticipated V V
.  

"  
Q  
Thank V V
you  
--  
I  
was V V
wondering V V
,  
there  
's V V
a  
lot  
of  
talk V V
right  
now  
about  
memoirs  
being V V
written V V
with  
the  
former  
President  
.  

After  
you  
are V V
elected V V
in  
2004  
,  
what  
will  
your  
memoirs  
say V V
about  
you  
,  
what  
will  
the  
title  
be V V
,  
and  
what  
will  
the  
main  
theme  
say V V
?  

"  
THE  
PRESIDENT  
:  
I  
appreciate V V
that  
.  

(  
Laughter  
.  
)  

There  
is V V
a  
painting V V
on  
my  
wall  
in  
the  
Oval  
--  
first  
of  
all  
,  
I  
do V V
n't  
know V V
.  

I  
'm V V
just  
speculating V V
now  
.  

I  
really  
have V V
n't  
thought V V
about  
writing V V
a  
book  
.  

My  
life  
is V V
too  
complicated V V
right  
now  
trying V V
to  
do V V
my  
job  
.  

(  
Laughter  
.  
)  

But  
if  
--  
there  
's V V
a  
painting V 
on  
the  
wall  
in  
the  
Oval  
Office  
that  
shows V V
a  
horseman  
charging V V
up  
a  
steep  
cliff  
,  
and  
there  
are V V
at  
least  
two  
other  
horsemen  
following V 
.  

It  
's V V
a  
Western  
scene  
by  
a  
guy  
named V V
W.H.S.  
Koerner  
called V V
'  
A  
Charge  
to  
Keep V V
.  
'  

It  
's V V
on  
loan V V
,  
by  
the  
way V V
,  
from  
a  
guy  
named V V
Joe  
O'Neill  
in  
Midland  
,  
Texas  
.  

He  
was V V
the  
person  
,  
he  
and  
his  
wife  
Jan  
,  
introduced V V
--  
reintroduced V V
me  
and  
Laura  
in  
his  
backyard  
in  
July  
of  
1977  
.  

Four  
months  
later  
,  
we  
were V V
married V V
.  

So  
he  
's V V
got V V
a  
--  
I  
'm V V
a  
decision  V
-  
maker  
and  
I  
can  
make V V
good  
decisions V V
.  

(  
Applause  
.  
)  

"  
And  
so  
we  
sang V V
this  
hymn  
--  
this  
is V V
a  
long  
story  
trying V V
to  
get V V
to  
your  
answer V V
.  

(  
Laughter  
.  
)  

This  
is V V
not  
a  
filibuster  
.  

(  
Laughter  
.  
)  

That  
's V V
a  
Senate  
term  
--  
particularly  
on  
good  
judges  
.  

(  
Applause  
.  
)  

The  
hymn  
was V V
sung V V
at  
my  
first  
inaugural  
church  
service V V
as  
governor  
.  

Laura  
and  
I  
are V V
Methodists  
.  

One  
of  
the  
Wesley  
boys  
wrote V V
the  
hymn  
.  

The  
painting V 
is V V
based V V
upon  
the  
hymn  
called V V
,  
'  
A  
Charge  V
to  
Keep V V
.  
'  

I  
have V V
.  

The  
hymn  
talks V V
about  
serving V V
something  
greater  
than  
yourself  
in  
life  
.  

I  
--  
which  
I  
try V V
to  
do V V

The

I  
guess V V
one  
way V V
,  
one  
thing  
to  
think V V
about  
it  
is V V
--  
one  
of  
the  
themes  
would  
be V V
,  
I  
was V V
given V V
a  
charge V V
to  
keep V V
.  

And  
I  
gave V V
it  
all  
my  
heart  
,  
all  
my  
energy  
,  
based  
upon  
principles  
that  
did V V
not  
change V V

I  
got V V

Now  
that  
's V V
a  
rambling  
response V V
.  

And  
I  
have V V
to  
wonder V V
:  
Did V V
he  
forget V V
that  
he  
already  
has V V
a  
memoir  
called V V
"  
A  
Charge  V
to  
Keep V V
"  
?  

That  
was V V
the  
name  
of  
his  
"  
autobiography  
"  
--  
ghost  
-  
written V V
by  
adviser  
Karen  
Hughes  
in  
1999  
.  

There  
has V V
been V V
random  
speculation V V
about  
Google  
developiong V V
a  
new  
browser  
and  
/  
or  
acquiring V V
Firefox  
.  

It  
is V V
true V V
that  
Google  
has V V
been V V
in  
acquisition  
mode  
.  

They  
have V V
acquired V V
Urchin

Zipdash

Applied  
Semantics  
,  
Picasa  
,  
Blogger  
,  
and

imaging V 
company  
Keyhole  
,  
so  
why  
not  
Firefox  
?  

I  
have V V
no  
inside  
information  
,  
but  
I  
have V V
been V V
following V V
links  
today  
that  
strongly  
indicate V V
that

this  
in

As

remain V V
largely

I

Ben  
made V V
another  
announcement V V
on  
March  
28  
,  
2005  
:  

I  
want V V
to  
use V V
this  
opportunity  
to  
welcome V V
Brian  
Ryner  
to  
Google  
!  

Brian  
has V V
been V V
one  
of  
the  
most  
crucial  
elements  
to  
the  
success V V
of  
Mozilla  
software  
over  
the  
past  
few  
years  
,  
...  

Great  
to  
have V V
you  
on  
board  
!  

Now  
,  
none  
of  
this  
has V V
been V V
confirmed V V
by  
Google  
at  
the  
present  
time  
,  
but  
it  
's V V
an  
old  
adage  
that  
you  
follow V V
the  
money  
to  
see V V
who  
is V V
behind  
something  
.  

In  
this  
case V 
,  
following V V
the  
talent  
leads V V
me  
to  
think V V
that  
Google  
will  
be V V
making V V
an  
announcement V V
this  
year  
that  
formalizes V V
the  
Google  
-  
Mozilla  
/  
Firefox  
relationship V V
.  

If  
you  
have V V
not  
already  
seen V V
the  
Flash  
movie  
Epic  
,  
you  
should  
take V V
a  
few  
minutes  
and  
view V V
the  
future  
history  
of  
media  
as  
conceived V V
by  
Robin  
Sloan  
and  
Matt  
Thompson  
,  
with  
music  
by  
Aaron  
McLeran  
.  

In  
this  
movie  
Google  
and  
Amazon  
(  
GOOGLEZON  
)  
create V V
a  
brave  
new  
world  
of  
media  
in  
2008  
.  

This  
is V V
one  
thought  V
-  
provoking  V
film  
.  

Every  
move V V
Google  
makes V V
brings V V
this  
particular  
future  
closer  
.  

Just  
one  
small  
commment  
-  
it  
's V V
not  
possible V V
,  
as  
far  
as  
I  
know V V
,  
for  
Google  
to  
"  
Aquire V V
"  
Firefox  
.  

They  
already  
have V V
rights V V
to  
take V V
it  
,  
alter V V
it  
,  
and  
release V V
those  
changes V V
to  
the  
world  
-  
this  
is V V
what  
the  
whole  
open  
source  
thing  
is V V
about  
.  

I  
'm V V
inclined V V
to  
say V V
that  
google  
is V V
doing V V
what  
they  
can  
to  
both  
shape V V
and  
support V V
the  
growth  V
of  
the  
most  
popular  
non-Microsoft  
browser  
out  
there  
-  
by  
taking V V
on  
the  
leading  
lights  
in  
Firefox  
development V V
,  
they  
're V V
ensuring V V
the  
continued  
life  
of  
the  
project  
,  
and  
ensuring V V
(  
not  
that  
I  
think V V
they  
need V V
to  
)  
that  
their  
voice V 
will  
be V V
heard V V
admidst  
the  
higher  
echelons  
of  
the  
firefox  
development V 
team  
.  

It  
's V V
this  
sort  
of  
enlightened  
self  
interest V V
that  
keeps V V
large  
open  
source  
projects  
alive V V
.  

Fascinating  
viewpoint  
of  
the  
future  
in  
Epic  
.  

Thanks V V
for  
the  
link  
.  

Malach  
,  
What  
you  
say V V
makes V V
sense V V
.  

Acquiring V V
open  
source  
talent  
gives V V
a  
company  
an  
inexpensive  
way V V
of  
influencing V V
and  
anticipating V V
the  
direction  V
an  
open  
source  
project  
will  
go V V
.  

It  
probably  
gives V V
more  
bang  
for  
the  
buck  
than  
acquiring V V
a  
private  
company  
and  
having V V
to  
handle V V
the  
inevitable  
culture  
clashes V V
and  
process  V
mis-matches  
.  

The  
Coalition  
decision V V
to  
provoke V V
a  
fight V V
with  
Muqtada  
al  
-  
Sadr  
's  
movement V V
only  
three  
months  
before  
the  
Coalition  
Provisional  
Authority  
goes V V
out  
of  
business  
has V V
to  
be V V
seen V V
as  
a  
form  
of  
gross  
incompetence  
in  
governance V V
.  

How  
did V V
the  
CPA  
get V V
to  
the  
point  
where  
it  
has V V
turned V V
even  
Iraqi  
Shiites  
,  
who  
were V V
initially  
grateful V V
for  
the  
removal V V
of  
Saddam  
Hussein  
,  
against  
the  
United  
States  
?  

Where  
it  
risks V V
fighting V V
dual  
Sunni  
Arab  
and  
Shiite  
insurgencies  
simultaneously  
,  
at  
a  
time  
when  
US  
troops  
are V V
rotating V V
on  
a  
massive  
scale  
and  
hoping V V
to  
downsize V V
their  
forces  
in  
country  
?  

At  
a  
time  
when  
the  
Spanish  
,  
Thai  
and  
other  
contingents  
are V V
already  
committed V V
to  
leaving V V
,  
and  
the  
UN  
is V V
reluctant V V
to  
get V V
involved V V
?  

One  
answer V V
is V V
that  
the  
Pentagon  
prevented V V
the  
State  
Department  
from  
running V V
the  
CPA  
.  

State  
is V V
the  
body  
with  
experience V V
in  
international  
affairs  
and  
administration V V
.  

The  
civilians  
in  
the  
Department  
of  
Defense  
only  
know V V
how  
to  
blow V V
things  
up  
.  

Rumsfeld  
,  
Wolfowitz  
and  
Feith  
staffed V V
the  
CPA  
with  
Neoconservatives  
,  
most  
of  
whom  
had V V
no  
administrative  
experience V V
,  
no  
Arabic  
,  
and  
no  
respect V V
for  
Muslim  
culture  
(  
or  
knowledge  
about  
it  
)  
.  

They  
actively  
excluded V V
State  
Department  
Iraq  
hands  
like  
Tom  
Warrick  
.  

(  
Only  
recently  
have V V
a  
few  
experienced  
State  
Department  
Arabists  
been V V
allowed V V
in  
to  
try V V
to  
begin V V
mopping V V
up  
the  
mess  
.  
)  

The  
Neocons  
in  
the  
CPA  
have V V
all  
sorts  
of  
ulterior  
motives  
and  
social  
experiments V V
they  
want V V
to  
impose  V
on  
the  
Iraqi  
people  
,  
including  
Polish  
-  
style  
economic  
shock V 
therapy  
,  
some  
sort  
of  
sweetheart  
deal V V
for  
Israel  
,  
and  
maybe  
even  
breaking V V
the  
country  
up  
into  
three  
parts  
.  

The  
Washington  
Monthly  
's  
Who  
's V V
Who  
of  
Neocons  
in  
Iraq  
helps V V
explain V V
the  
extreme  
incompetence  
and  
possibly  
double  
-  
dealing V V
of  
many  
in  
the  
CPA  
.  

Sept.  
11  
Commission  
member  
Philip  
Zelikow  
,  
who  
is V V
close V V
to  
the  
Bush  
administration V V
,  
admitted V V
on  
Sept.  
10  
,  
2002  
,  
that  
the  
ulterior  
motive  
of  
the  
Bush  
administration V V
for  
the  
Iraq  
War  
was V V
to  
"  
protect V V
Israel  
,  
"  
according  
to  
the  
Asian  
Times  
.  

I  
have V V
long  
been V V
a  
trenchant  
critic  
of  
the  
Sadrists  
.  

But  
they  
have V V
n't  
been V V
up  
to  
anything  
extraordinary  
as  
far  
as  
I  
can  
see V V
in  
recent  
weeks  
.  

Someone  
in  
the  
CPA  
sat V V
down  
and  
thought V V
up  
ways V V
to  
stir V V
them  
up  
by  
closing V V
their  
newspaper  
and  
issuing V V
28  
arrest  
warrants  V
and  
taking V V
in  
people  
like  
Yaqubi  
.  

This  
is V V
either  
gross  
incompetence  
or  
was V V
done V V
with  
dark  
ulterior  
motives  
that  
can  
scarcely  
be V V
guessed V V
at  
.  

There  
is V V
a  
classical  
logical  
fallacy  
,  
post  
hoc  
ergo  
propter  
hoc  
(  
Z  
happens V V
after  
X  
,  
therefore  
Z  
is V V
caused V V
by  
X  
)  
,  
and  
I  
keep V V
revising V V
this  
posting V V
this  
evening  
because  
I  
do V V
n't  
want V V
to  
fall V V
into  
it  
.  

But  
sometimes  
,  
of  
course  
,  
when  
Z  
happens V V
after  
X  
it  
is V V
because  
of  
X  
.  

So  
I  
may  
as  
well  
just  
come V V
out  
with  
it  
:  
It  
is V V
pretty  
suspicious  
,  
given  
the  
Neocon  
predominance  
in  
the  
CPA  
and  
in  
the  
upper  
reaches  
of  
the  
Defense  
Department  
that  
on  
April  
2  
AP  
reported V V
of  
Muqtada  
:  

'  
A  
radical  
Shiite  
Muslim  
cleric  
has V V
expressed V V
solidarity  
with  
the  
militant  
Palestinian  
group  
Hamas  
and  
said V V
that  
he  
should  
be V V
considered V V
the  
group  
's  
"  
striking  
arm  
"  
in  
Iraq  
.  

"  
I  
have V V
said V V
and  
I  
repeat V V
my  
expression V V
of  
solidarity  
which  
Hassan  
Nasrallah  
called V V
for  
to  
stand V V
with  
Hamas  
,  
"  
Shiite  
cleric  
Muqtada  
al  
-  
Sadr  
said V V
Friday  
in  
a  
reference V V
to  
Nasrallah  
,  
the  
leader  
of  
the  
militant  
Lebanese  
Shiite  
group  
Hezbollah  
.  

Last  
month  
,  
Nasrallah  
announced V V
that  
his  
party  
would  
close V V
ranks  
with  
Hamas  
.  

"  
Let V V
(  
Hamas  
)  
consider V V
me  
their  
striking  
arm  
in  
Iraq  
because  
the  
fate  
of  
Iraq  
and  
Palestine  
is V V
the  
same  
,  
"  
al  
-  
Sadr  
said V V
during  
a  
Friday  
prayer  
sermon  
in  
Kufa  
,  
his  
home  
base  
south  
of  
Baghdad  
.  

He  
did V V
comment V V
on  
what  
he  
meant V V
by  
the  
phrase  
.  
'  

And  
on  
April  
3  
his  
chief  
aide  
in  
Najaf  
was V V
suddenly  
arrested V V
along  
with  
13  
other  
members  
of  
his  
organization  
,  
and  
the  
Coalition  
forces  
are V V
put V V
into  
violent  
conflict V V
with  
his  
organization  
,  
which  
leaves V V
7  
US  
soldiers  
dead  
.  

The  
Army  
is V V
unlikely V V
to  
forgive V V
or  
forget V V
;  
but  
who  
provoked V V
it  
and  
why  
?  

I  
'm V V
not  
even  
in  
Iraq  
and  
I  
could  
have V V
predicted V V
to  
you  
the  
consequences  
of  
doing V V
what  
the  
CPA  
has V V
been V V
doing V V
.

All  
:  

It  
is V V
my  
understanding V V
,  
from  
good  
sources  
in  
the  
Gov  
s  
office  
that  
the  
Gov  
will  
order V V
Loretta  
Lynch  
to  
expeditiously  
implement V V
the  
provision V V
to  
suspend V V
all  
parties  
auhtority  
to  
enter V V
into  
direct  
access V V
contracts  
.  

The  
premise  
with  
which  
the  
administartion  V
is V V
acting V V
is V V
that  
if  
they  
expeditiously  
suspend V V
everyone  
's  
right V V
to  
bilateral  
contracts  
quickly  
,  
it  
sets V V
up  
a  
barrier  
which  
the  
direct  
access V 
coalition  
must  
break V V
through V 
.  

In  
other  
words  
the  
table  
is V V
set V V
.  

Deal V V
your  
meal  
from  
where  
the  
dishes  
are V V
located V V
.  

I.E.  
the  
Davis  
Administration V V
wants V V
to  
place V V
all  
direct  
access  V
advocates  
in  
the  
position  
of  
having V V
to  
justify V V
why  
each  
and  
every  
party  
should  
be V V
the  
exception V V
to  
the  
suspension V V
rather  
than  
have V V
a  
general  
rule V V
concerning  
how  
direct  
access V V
should  
work V V
for  
all  
parties  
.  

It  
clearly  
gives V V
the  
Admin  V
a  
very  
strong  
upper  
hand  
to  
control V V
who  
when  
and  
where  
direct  
access V V
can  
occur V V
without  
having V V
to  
say V V
that  
they  
oppose V V
direct  
access V V
.  

Power  
be V V
where  
power  
lies V V
.  

you  
are V V
n't  
going V V
in  
for  
the  
wedding V V
until  
sunday  
now  
?  

I  
'm V V

I  
spoke V V
to  
Bruce  
Garcey  
at  
NiMo  
regarding  
their  
RFP  
.  

Bruce  
indicated V V
NiMo  
short  
listed V V
five  
companies  
who  
all  
bid V V
higher  
than  
ENA  
.  

However  
,  
he  
also  
mentioned V V
we  
were V V
a  
close  
sixth  
,  
that  
is V V
close V V
to  
the  
fifth  
highest  
bid V V
.  

He  
gave V V
no  
indication V V
on  
the  
value  
of  
the  
highest  
bid V V
.  

He  
also  
said V V
that  
the  
other  
five  
companies  
making V V
the  
short  
list  
all  
proposed V 
alternative  
structures  
to  
the  
proposed  
NiMo  
Tier  
Structure  
.  

NiMo  
released V V
an  
additional  
RFP  
for  
peaking V 
supplies V V
for  
this  
winter  
,  
I  
believe V V
Phil  
should  
have V V
or  
be V V
getting V V
that  
RFP  
.  

Phil  
if  
you  
could  
please  
make V V
copies V V
and  
distribute V V
ASAP

On  
or  
about  
September  
23

a

for  
service V V
was V V
placed V V
by  
the  
above  
referenced V V
counterparty  
.  

The  
request V V
was V V
for  
a  
Intrastate  
Gas  
Transportation V 
Agreement V V
and  
311  
Gas  
Transportation V 
Agreement V V
.  

These

she  
informed V V
me  
that

the  
agreement V V
,  
which  
reads V V
in  
part  
:  
Gas  
is V V
free V V
from  
liens  
and  
adverse  
claims V V
of  
every  
kind  
,  
should  
be V V
changed V V
because  
the  
gas  
that  
the  
counterparty  
will  
be V V
transporting V V
on  
HPL  
may  
and  
/  
or  
is V V
subject  
to  
liens  
.  

She  
was V V
instructed V V
to  
destroy V V
the  
agreement V V
and  
another

be V V
forwarded V V
to  
her

the  
necessary  
corrections V V
and  
re-wording V V
of  
Section

the  
attached  
guaranty

A  
clean  
and  
redlined V V
version  
are V V
attached V V

I

language  
based  
on  
our

added V V
the  
language  
concerning  
interest  V
which  
we

previously  
approved V V

What  
's V V
going V V
on  
dude  
?  

Antigua  
was V V
awesome V V
.  

I  
survived V V
it  
without  
a  
problem  
.  

Heather  
moving V V
in  
has V V
been V V
a  
different  
story  
.  

I  
did V V
n't  
realize V V
how  
much  
"  
stuff  
"  
you  
could  
pack V V
into  
a  
one  
bedroom  
apartment  
.  

How  
is V V
your  
love  
life  
.  

The  
gal  
from  
the  
wedding V V
was V V
pretty  
hot V V
.  

Are V V
you  
still  
chasing V V
that  
?  

Let V V
s  
get V V
together  
soon  
.  

Our  
extra  
bedroom  
is V V
nicer V V
now  
.  

My  
old  
bed  
got V V
tossed V V
in  
a  
dumpster  
.  

It  
smelled V V
like  
shit  
.  

Talk V V
to  
you  
later  

GT  

How  
is V V
it  
going V V
?  

Did V V
you  
survive V V
the  
honeymoon V V
?  

These  
look V V
fine V V
to  
me  
.  

Go V V
ahead  
and  
forward V V
to  
Brant  
if  
you  
are V V
ready V V
.

Glad  
to  
hear V V
all  
is V V
well V V
.  

I  
meant V V
to  
comment V V
that  
I  
thought V V
the  
people  
profiled V V
in  
the  
article  
should  
pull V V
their  
heads  
out  
of  
their  
self  
important  
asses  
.  

It  
is V V
n't  
about  
finding V V
the  
meaning V V
of  
life  
at  
work V V
.  

It  
is V V
all  
about  
the  
$$$  
.  

Work V V
hard  
.  

Make V V
$$$  
.  

Retire V V
young V 
.  

Things  
with  
me  
are V V
great V V
.  

Moving  V
back  
to  
Calgary  
in  
about  
a  
month  
which  
is V V
a  
little  
sooner  
than  
I  
thought V V
I  
would  
be V V
going V V
back  
but  
when  
opportunity  
knocks V V
you  
got V V
ta  
go V V
.  

Take V V
care V V
.  

I  
do V V
n't  
hear V V
from  
you  
in  
months  
and  
then  
you  
level V V
me  
with  
such  
a  
thought  
provoking  V
,  
soul  
searching  
article  
.  

Thanks V V
for  
thinking V V
of  
me  
to  
send V V
it  
to  
.  

I  
really  
enjoyed V V
reading V V
it  
.  

We  
certainly  
fit V V
into  
certain  
parts  
of  
the  
article  
.  

There  
are V V
a  
few  
life  
theories  
like  
that  
which  
working V V
through  
.  

It  
s V V
all  
interesting  
stuff  
.  

How  
are V V
things  
going V V
with  
you  
?  

Are V V
you  
enjoying V V
Houston  
?  

London  
has V V
been V V
great V V
.  

Brokering V V
over  
here  
has V V
been V V
pretty  
rewarding  
.  

Traders  
over  
here  
seem V V
to  
have V V
a  
lot  
more  
respect V V
for  
other  
humans  
.  

Catriona  
is V V
well V V
and  
has V V
landed V V
herself  
a  
pretty  
cool  
job  
in  
PR  
.  

Keep V V
in  
touch V V
,

I  
was V V
thinking V V
of  
converting V V
it  
to  
a  
hover  
vehicle  
.  

I  
might  
just  
sell V V
the  
car  
and  
get V V
you  
to  
drive V V
me  
around  
all  
winter  
.  

How  
about  
skidoo  
skis  
for  
the  
front  
and  
tracks  
for  
the  
back  
..  

Lexus  
IS  V
300  
.  

Not  
sure  
if  
I  
am V V
going V V
to  
buy V V
17  
"  
or  
16  
"  
wheels  
for  
the  
winter  
.  

Jackass  
.  

You  
have V V
always  
been V V
on  
the  
move V V
seeking V V
affectionate  
,  
satisfying  
and  
harmonious  
relationships V V
.  

Your  
ultimate  
goal  
has V V
been V V
the  
realisation V V
of  
an  
intimate  
union V 
in  
which  
there  
could  
be V V
love V V
,  
self  
-  
sacrifice V V
and  
mutual  
trust  
.  

It  
has V V
often  
been V V
said V V
that  
"  
True  
love V V
is V V
just  
around  
the  
corner  
"  
...  
and  
maybe  
...  
if  
you  
have V V
n't  
found V V
it  
as  
yet  
-  
you  
possibly  
soon  
will  
.  

In  
the  
past  
there  
have V V
been V V
..  
and  
maybe  
there  
still  
are V V
many  
things  
that  
you  
have V V
had V V
to  
do V V
without  
.  

You  
have V V
now  
decided V V
to  
set V V
your  
sights V 
on  
a  
position  
or  
situation  
that  
could  
give V V
you  
greater  
prestige  
and  
which  
will  
afford V V
you  
considerable  
self  
esteem  
.  

You  
wear V V
your  
heart  
on  
your  
sleeve  
...  
and  
since  
you  
are V V
an  
emotional  
person  
you  
are V V
apt V V
to  
give V V
your  
all  
...  
heart  
and  
soul  
...  
to  
all  
those  
that  
show V V
you  
a  
little  
affection V V
...  
but  
take V V
care V V
...  
it  
would  
appear V V
that  
you  
have V V
been V V
extremely  
hurt V V
in  
the  
past  
...  
and  
you  
keep V V

Whatever  
you  
strive V V
to  
do V V
,  
something  
always  
seems V V
to  
be V V
holding V V
you  
back  
.  

There  
is V V
no  
subterfuge  
in  
you

You  
are V V

clear  
thinker  
and  
all  
you  
demand V V
from  
life  
,  
in  
a  
relationship V V
,  
is V V
a  
partner  
whom  
you  
can  
trust V V
and  
with  
whom  
you  
can  
,  
together  
,  
develop V V
a  
foundation  
of  
trust  
based  
on  
understanding V V
.  

You  
are V V
your  
own  
person  
...  
and  
you  
demand V V
freedom  
of  
thought V V
...  
to  
follow V V
your  
own  
convictions V V
.  

You  
have V V
no  
interest V V
in  
"  
two V 
-  
timing  V
"  
and  
all  
you  
seek V V
is V V
sincerity  
and  
"  
straight  
-  
dealing V V
"  
.  

You  
wish V V
to  
be V V
left V V
in  
peace V V

no  
more  
conflict V V
and  
no

arguments V V
of  
any

All  
you  
want V V

get V V
on  
with  
it

Vince  

Dear  
All  
,  

My  
mane  
is V V
Visit  
Phunnarungsi  
.  

I  
used V V
to  
e-mail V V
Vince  
Kaminski  
about  
the  
advice  
on  
his  
article  
"  
The  
Challenge  V
of  
Pricing V V
and  
Risk  V
Managing V V
Electricity  
Derivatives  
"  
and  
he  
had V V
mailed V V
me  
the  
copy V V
.  

I  
am V V
now  
modelling V V
the  
Queensland  
electricity  
spot  
price V V
using V V
Geometric  
Brownian  
Mean  
Reverting V 
Jump  
Diffusion V 
Model V 
and  
have V V
followed V V
your  
paper  
"  
Making V V
the  
most  
of  
mean  
reversion  V
"  
to  
estimate V V
the  
mean  
reversion V 
speed  
.  

I  
use V V
Queensland  
half  
-  
hourly  
price V V
during  
13  
December  
,  
1998  
-  
30  
June  
2001  
giving V V
about  
44,000  
price  
observations V V
.  

However  
,  
the  
result  
from  
Ordinary  
Least  
Squares  
was V V
not  
as  
expected V V
due  
to  
different  
sign V 
for  
both  
slope  
&  
intercept  
.  

The  
coefficient  
and  
standard  
error V V
are V V
as  
followed V V
:  

Intercept  
:  
-  
0.3931  
(  
0.0076  
)  

Slope  
:  
0.1171  
(  
0.0022  
)  

R  
Square  
:  
0.0585  

Therefore  
I  
could  
not  
estimate V V
the  
mean  
reversion V 
rate  
as  
the  
estimated  
slope  
has V V
the  
positive  
sign V V
.  

I  
have V V
also  
tried V V
monthly  
data  
and  
the  
results  
are V V
the  
same  
.  

It  
would  
be V V
appreciated V V
if  
you  
could  
advice V V
me  
on  
this  
matter  
.

Thanks V V
for  
the  
message  
regarding  
a  
possible  
intern  
for  
your  
group  
.  

Right  
now  
,  
we  
are V V
in  
the  
process V V
of  
evaluating V V
both  
our  
new  
hire  
needs V V
and  
our  
summer  
needs V V
and  
will  
be V V
making V V
those  
decisions V V
after  
the  
first  
of  
the  
year  
.  

Until  
we  
have V V
come V V
up  
with  
those  
numbers  
it  
would  
be V V
premature V V
to  
make V V
any  
offers V V
for  
the  
summer  
.  

What  
I  
would  
like V V
to  
do V V
in  
this  
case  V
is V V
get V V
the  
information  
to  
Jeff  
Davis  
,  
who  
is V V
responsible V V
for  
Georgia  
Tech  
and  
ask V V
him  
to  
get V V
Sungjoo  
's  
resume  
and  
start V V
a  
file  
on  
him  
with  
a  
notation V V
that  
you  
would  
like V V
to  
hire V V
him  
for  
summer  
.  

When  
we  
start V V
the  
summer  
process V V
,  
we  
will  
interview V V
the  
candidate  
and  
slot  V
him  
for  
your  
group  
.  

Is V V
this  
okay  
with  
you  
?  

Hope V V
all  
is V V
well V V
with  
you  

Take V V
Care V V

Traci

I  
have V V
visited V V

interested V V

He  
came V V
across  
as  
a  
very  
bright  
person  
,  
very  
personable  
.  

I  
can  
take V V
him

Please

Thank V V

This  
section  
pertains V V
to  
terminated

The  
way V V
the  
tax  
law  
works V V
,  
the  
tax  
basis  
for  
your  
share  
distribution V V
will  
be V V
based V 
on  
the  
closing  
stock  
price V V
the  
day  
preceding V 
notification V V
to  
the  
transfer  
agent  
.  

As  
such  
,  
we  
will  
distribute V V
net  
shares V V
calculating V V
the  
proper  
withholding V V
at  
fair  
market  
value  
the  
day  
prior  
to  
notifying V V
the  
transfer  
agent  
.  

We  
will  
be V V
distributing V V
the  
shares V V
reflected V V
on  
your  
9/30/01  
statement V V
(  
6,606  
shares V V
plus

If  
you  
would  
prefer V V
to  
settle V V
the  
taxes  
with  
a  
personal  
check  
,  
we  
can  
distribute V V
gross

Please

As  
you  
know V V

in  
the

recordkeeping

As

He  
has V V
become V V

much  
more  
knowledgeable  
than  
myself  
)  
and  
the  
various  
plan  
provision  V
amendments V V
.  

If  
you  
would  
like V V
,  
we  
can  
set V V
up  
a  
conference  
call V V
with  
you

Larry  
to  
go V V

Please

Renee  
,  

Thank V V
you  
for  
digging V V
in  
to  
the  
issue V V
of  
Deferred V 
Phantom  
Stock  
Units  
.  

It  
is V V
clear V V
that  
the  
payment V V
will  
be V V
made V V
in  
shares V V
.  

However  
,  
I  
still  
do V V
n't  
understand V V
which  
date  
will  
be V V
used V V
to  
determine V V
the  
value  
and  
calculate V V
how  
many  
shares V V
.  

The  
plan  V
document  
under  
VII  
.  

Amount  
of  
Benefit  
Payments  
reads V V
"  
The  
value  
of  
the  
shares V V
,  
and  
resulting V 
payment  
amount  
will  
be V V
based V 
on  
the  
closing  
price V V
of  
Enron  
Corp.  
common  
stock  
on  
the  
January  
1  
before  
the  
date  
of  
payment V V
,  
and  
such  
payment V V
shall  
be V V
made V V
in  
shares V V
of  
Enron  
Corp.  
common  
stock  
.  
"  

Can  
you  
help V V
me  
interpret V V
this  
statement V V
and  
work V V
through  
the  
numbers  
on  
my  
account  
.  

Thank V V
you

Let V V
me  
know V V
when  
you  
get V V
the  
quotes V V
from  
Pauline  
.  

I  
am V V
expecting V V
to  
pay V V
something  
in  
the  
$  
3,  
to  
$  
5,000  
range  
.  

I  
would  
like V V
to  
see V V
the  
quotes V V
and  
a  
description V V
of  
the  
work V V
to  
be V V
done V V
.  

It  
is V V
my  
understanding V V
that  
some  
rock  
will  
be V V
removed V V
and  
replaced V V
with  
siding  
.  

If  
they  
are V V
getting V V
quotes V V
to  
put V V
up  
new  
rock  
then  
we  
will  
need V V
to  
clarify V V
.  

Jacques  
is V V
ready V V
to  
drop V V
in  
a  
dollar  
amount  
on  
the  
release V V
.  

If  
the  
negotiations V V
stall V V
,  
it  
seems V V
like  
I  
need V V
to  
go V V
ahead  
and  
cut V V
off  
the  
utilities  
.  

Hopefully  
things  
will  
go V V
smoothly  
.

I  
faxed V V

promotional  
on  
10300  
Heritage  
Office  
Building  
with  
the  
Nimitz

office  
.  

The  
broker  
called V V
back  
shortly  
after  
I  
spoke V V
to  
you  
to  
let V V
me  
know V V
that  
the

air  
park  
building  
and  
the  
strip  
center  
at

had V V
both  
sold V V
.  

Let V V
me  
know V V
what  
you  
think V V
of  
this  
property  
.  

Also  
,  
let V V

know V V

Take V V
a  
look V V
at

I

to  
calculate V V
the  
IRR  
on  
the

Roma

Is V V
this  
how  
your

usually  
evaluate V V
these

The  
Roma  
deal V V
looks V V
much  
better V V

Phillip  

Mery

This  
sounds V V
better V V
than  
the  
limitations V V
you  
were V V
describing V V

the  
meeting V V
.  

We

be V V
able V V

I  
for  
one  
was V V
very  
happy V V
to  
hear V V
about  
your  
quitting V V
smoking V V

I  
've V V
never

&  
am V V
a  
very  
strong  
anti-smoker

but  
I  
'm V V
an  
over-eater  
&  
so  
I  
know V V
how  
hard  
it  
is V V
to  
change V V
a  
habit  
.  

Good  
luck  
w/  
it

will  
pray V V

you

have V V
the

they

I  
was V V
ashamed

...  
until  
I  
undrstood V V
that  
it

as  
well  
as  
women  
wearing V V
men  
's

Some

COMPLETE  
ARTICLE  V
AT  
:  
http://discountairlineticket.blogspot.com/2005/10/some-techniques-to-...  

Several  
years  
ago  
I  
developed V V
a  
short  
paper  
and  
pencil  
screening  V
test V V
which  
,  
in  
a  
small  
pilot  
study V V
,  
discriminated V V
between  
ADHD  
,  
LD  
,  
and  
control  
subjects  
.  

I  
recently  
converted V V
this  
test V V
to  
an  
online  
test V V
in  
order  
to  
norm V V
it  
to  
a  
larger  
population V V
and  
,  
subsequently  
,  
to  
make V V
it  
available V V
to  
any  
one  
who  
has V V
access V V
to  
a  
computer  
and  
the  
Internet  
.  

The  
test V V
itself  
is V V
what  
is V V
called V V
a  
substitution  
test V V
.  

It  
has V V
two  
parts  
,  
both  
of  
which  
are V V
timed V V
for  
90  
seconds  
each  
and  
the  
differential  
between  
the  
resulting V V
two  
scores V 
determines V V
the  
likelihood  V
of  
having V V
a  
learning  
disability  
or  
attention  
deficit  
disorder  
.  

I  
am V V
in  
need V V
of  
test  
subjects  
and  
hope V V
you  
will  
take V V
it  
.  

The  
test V V
,  
along  
with  
an  
information  
form  
,  
is V V
available V V
at  
:  
.  

I  
think V V
a  
test V V
like  
this  
one  
is V V
much  
needed V V
.  

A  
person  
can  
take V V
it  
directly  
instead  
of  
others  
completing V V
behavioral  
checklists  
or  
a  
completing V V
a  
lengthy  
program  
intensive  
test V V
like  
TOVA  
.  

Perhaps  
you  
are V V
willing V V
to  
recommend V V
this  
site  
and  
,  
if  
you  
have V V
a  
website  
,  
place V V
a  
link  
on  
your  
website  
.  

are V V
there  
any  
sadists  
out  
there  
who  
share V V
the  
same  
tastes V V
as  
i  
do V V
?  

i  
do V V
nt  
know V V
what  
it  
is V V
,  
but  
since  
a  
very  
young  
age  
i  
have V V
had V V
a  
strange  
but  
very  
gratifying  
urge V 
to  
torture V V
or  
maime V V
animals  
.  

i  
am V V
deadly  
serious V V
,  
i  
really  
do V V
get V V
sexual  
releif  
from  
even  
hearing V V
of  
torture V V
of  
animals  
,  
now  
some  
people  
may  
call V V
me  
a  
brute  
or  
a  
coward  
but  
i  
ca  
nt  
help V V
my  
true  
feelings V V
.  

badger  
baiting V V
is V V
natrually  
a  
huge  
turn  V
on V 
,  
so  
i  
thought V V
a  
few  
words  
in  
this  
group  
might  
uncover V V
some  
mutual  
enthusiasts  
.  

sincere  
appologies  
to  
anyone  
who  
is V V
offended V V
by  
my  
request V V
but  
my  
request V V
is V V
genuine V V
.

Once  
upon  
a  
time  
(  
in  
2001  
,  
to  
be V V
specific  V
)  
,  
the  
Coca  
-  
Cola  
corporation  
built V V
a  
bottling  
plant  
in  
a  
small  
and  
remote  
Indian  
village  
in  
the  
state  
of  
Kerala  
.  

In  
exchange V V
for  
sucking V V
vast  
amounts  
of  
water  
out  
of  
the  
local  
land  
,  
the  
mighty  
corporation  
promised V V
to  
bring V V
the  
people  
great  
wealth  
.  

But  
within  
a  
few  
short  
months  
,  
the  
village  
people  
began V V
to  
notice V V
their  
wells  
were V V
running V V
dry  
,  
so  
they  
complained V V
to  
the  
corporation  
.  

Coca  
-  
Cola  
calmed V V
the  
concerns V V
of  
the  
people  
and  
attempted V V
to  
win V V
back  
their  
favor  
by  
giving V V
them  
vast  
amounts  
of  
free  
fertilizer  
,  
saying V V
it  
would  
grow V V
bountiful  
crops  
beyond  
their  
wildest  
dreams V V
.  

After  
several  
years  
of  
use V V
,  
we  
arrive V V
at  
the  
present  
day  
when  
the  
village  
people  
have V V
suddenly  
discovered V V
the  
fertilizer  
is V V
actually  
the  
bottling  
plant  
's  
waste  V
sludge  
and  
is V V
laden  V
with  
cadmium  
,  
a  
highly  
toxic  
,  
cancer  
-  
causing  V
heavy  
metal  
.  

The  
village  
soil  
and  
water  
are V V
now  
too  
heavily  
contaminated V V
to  
safely  
occupy V V
human  
life  
,  
so  
the  
plant  
was V V
shut V V
down  
last  
week  
.  

Moral  
of  
the  
story  
:  
Do V V
n't  
drink V V
Coke  
..........  
drink V V
Pepsi  
!  

Just  
kidding V V
,  
Pepsi  
is V V
actually  
in  
the  
process V V
of  
being V V
thrown V V
out  
of  
India  
for  
similar  
crimes  
,  
as  
well  
.  

The  
Greater  
New  
Orleans  
Fair  
Housing  
Action  
Center  
(  
GNOFHAC  
)  
filed V V
a  
housing  
discrimination V 
complaint V V
against  
the  
Housing  
Authority  
of  
New  
Orleans  
(  
HANO  
)  
last  
week  
.  

The  
complaint V V
,  
filed V V
with  
the  
United  
States  
Department  
of  
Housing  
and  
Urban  
Development  
,  
accuses V V
HANO  
of  
violating V V
a  
2003  
enforcement  
agreement V V
entered V V
into  
between  
former  
St.  
Thomas  
Housing  
Development  
residents  
,  
the  
City  
of  
New  
Orleans  
,  
HANO  
,  
and  
the  
U.S.  
Department  
of  
Housing  
and  
Urban  
Development  
during  
the  
HOPE  
VI  
redevelopment  V
of  
St.  
Thomas  
,  
now  
known V V
as  
River  
Garden  
.  

The  
current  
complaints V V
allege V V
that  
HANO  
has V V
not  
provided V V
qualified  
former  
St.  
Thomas  
residents  
a  
preference V V
with  
respect V V
to  
available  
public  
housing V V
units  
at  
River  
Garden  
per  
the  
2003  
agreement V V
.  

Upon  
return V V
to  
New  
Orleans  
after  
the  
Hurricane  
Katrina  
evacuation V V
,  
former  
residents  
have V V
been V V
informed V V
that  
there  
are V V
no  
available  
public  
housing V 
units  
at  
River  
Garden  
because  
those  
units  
have V V
been V V
reserved V V
for  
HANO  
employees  
.  

Therefore  
,  
public  
housing V V
residents  
have V V
been V V
unable V V
to  
secure V V
the  
units  
for  
which  
they  
qualified V V
prior  
to  
the  
storm  
and  
are V V
left V V
homeless V V
,  
as  
a  
result  
.  

"  
In  
the  
wake  V
of  
Hurricane  
Katrina  
,  
affordable  
housing V V
in  
New  
Orleans  
is V V
more  
scarce V V
than  
ever  
.  

As  
such  
,  
it  
is V V
essential V V
that  
HANO  
comply V V
with  
2003  
enforcement  
agreement V V
,  
"  
said V V
James  
Perry

Director  

Crude  
-  
oil  
prices V V
rose V V
Wednesday  
as  
strengthening  
Hurricane  
Rita  
,  
now  
a  
Category  
5  
storm  
,  
threatened V V
to  
disrupt V V
oil  
production V V
in  
the  
Gulf

Mexico  
.  

New  
York  
's  
main  
contract  
,  
light  
sweet  
crude  
for  
delivery V V
in  
November  
rose V V
60  
cents  
to  
close V V
at  
66.80  
dollars  
per  
barrel  
.  

In  
London  
,  
the  
price V V
of  
Brent  
North  
Sea  
crude  
for  
November  
delivery V V
advanced V V
53  
cents  
to  
64.73  
dollars  
.  

After  
brushing V V
the  
Florida  
Keys  
islands  
on  
Tuesday  
,  
Rita  
packed V V
winds  
of  
about  
240  
kilometers  
an  
hour  
as  
it  
headed V V
across  
the  
Gulf  
of  
Mexico  
.  

The  
US  
National  
Hurricane  
Center  
said V V
Rita  
was V V
"  
extremely  
dangerous V V
"  
and  
could  
become V V
a  
top  
-  
level  
category  
five  
storm  
on  
the  
Saffir  
-  
Simpson  
scale  
.  

The  
storm  
threatened V V
oil  
installations  V
in  
the  
Gulf  
of  
Mexico  
where  
about  
one  
-  
quarter  
of  
US  
oil  
operations V V
are V V
based V V
.  

Oil  
companies  
evacuated V V
offshore  
facilities  
as  
the  
storm  
's  
progress V V
kept V V
global  
markets  
on  
tenterhooks  
.  

In  
Texas  
,  
BP  
shut V V
its  
460,000  
barrels  
per  
day  
refinery  
and  
Marathon  
shut V V
its  
72,000  
bpd  
plant  
.  

Valero  
said V V
it  
was V V
reducing V V

at  
its  
243,000

Exxon

nonessential

Last  
month

Katrina  
devastated V V

(

NASA  
is V V
looking V V
to  
private  
companies  
to  
launch V V
both  
supplies V V
and  
astronauts  
to  
the  
International  
Space  
Station  
,  
it  
announced V V
this  
week  
.  

[  
...  
]  

"  
It  
's V V
not  
cost  
-  
effective V 
doing V V
station  
flights V V
while  
at  
the  
same  
time  
focusing V V
on  
getting V V
back  
to  
the  
Moon  
,  
"  
says V V
Brett  
Alexander  
,  
vice-president  
of  
Transformational  
Space  
,  
one  
of  
the  
companies  
hoping V V
to  
launch V V
astronauts  
to  
the  
ISS  
.  

NASA  
intends V V
upon  
retiring V V
the  
space  
shuttles  
in  
2010  
,  
which  
only  
leaves V V
it  
with  
18  
flights V V
towards  
the  
ISS  
.  

Outsourcing V V
these  
responsibilities  
would  
be V V
a  
wise  
alternative  
,  
considering V V
the  
accomplishments  V
of  
the  
private  
sector  
regarding  
the  
space  
elevator  
.  

Although  
some  
may  
praise V V
this  
as  
an  
opportunity  
for  
the  
private  
sector  
to  
finally  
serve V V
the  
public  
good  
,  
NASA  
seems V V
hesitant V V
about  
turning V V
over  
the  
reigns  
to  
the  
corporate  
world  
.  

(  
New

On  
3  
November  
,  
NASA  
administrator  
Michael  
Griffin  
told V V
the  
US  
house  
science  
committee  
that  
the  
agency  
expects V V
to  
invest V V
about  
$  
500  
million  
in  
the  
commercial  
cargo  
and  
crew  
project  
over  
five  
years  
.  

"  
That  
kind  
of  
a  
financial  
incentive  
[  
...  
]  
will  
be V V
sufficient  V
to  
allow V V
substantial  
providers  
to  
emerge V V
,  
"  
Griffin  
said V V
.  

"  
I  
hope V V
that  
industry  
,  
if  
put V V
to  
the  
test V V
,  
can  
do V V
better  
[  
than  
the  
government  
]  
,  
but  
I  
do V V
not  
expect V V
it  
,  
"  
Griffin  
added V V
.  

Only  
time  
will  
reveal V V
whether  
Griffin  
's  
expectations V V
are V V
either  
exceeded V V
or  
confirmed V V
.  

But  
seeing V V
how  
the  
private  
sector  
has V V
been V V
able V V
to  
successfully  
transport V V
civilians  
to  
the  
ISS  
(  
at  
about  
a  
fifth  
of  
the  
cost  
)  
,  
it  
would  
come V V
to  
no  
surprise V V
if  
corporate  
America  
was V V
able V V
to  
out  
perform V V
their  
bureaucratic  
friends  
in  
government

Normally  
this  
author  
is V V
semi-objective  
(  
what  
blogger  
is V V
)  
but  
on  
the  
Seattlepi.com  
(  
see V V
source  
link  
)  
Palestinian  
Leader  
Mahmoud  
Abbas  
has V V
demanded V V
that  
Israel  
leave V V
all  
the  
land  
that  
it  
occupies V V
before  
the  
1967  
border  
(  
which  
includes V V
East  
Jerusalem  
by  
the  
way  V
)  
.  

One  
thing  
is V V
certain V V
for  
sure  
.  

If  
Abbas  
keeps V V
up  
this  
"  
macho  
talk V V
"  
he  
will  
kill V V
potential

might  
as

allow V V
Hamas  
(  
which  
has V V
probably  
done V V
a  
better  
job  
at

election V V
Mahmoud  
Abbas  
talks V V
during  
his  
first  
official  
campaign  
speech V V
in  
the  
West  
Bank  
town  
of  
Ramallah  
,  
Saturday  
Dec.  
25  
,  
2004  
.  

Cloaking V V
himself  
in  
Yasser  
Arafat  
's  
legacy  
,  
Abbas  
pledged V V
to  
fulfill V V
Palestinian  
dreams V V
of  
statehood  V
.  

It  
seems V V
that  
the  
Palestinian  
leadership V V
(  
upcoming  
)  
will  
not  
be V V
a  
peace  
partner  
with  
Israel  
.  

He  
is V V
already  
demanding V V
claims V V
that  
Israel  
said V V
no  
to  
not  
only  
the  
world  
,  
but  
to  
Arafat  
himself  
.  

Listing V V
his  
priorities  
,  
Abbas  
told V V
supporters  
of  
the  
ruling  
Fatah  
party  
that  
he  
was V V
determined V V
to  
provide V V
security  
to  
his  
people  
and  
continue V V
the  
struggle V V
against  
Israel  
's  
partially  
completed  
West  
Bank  
barrier  
.  

Abbas  
also  
pledged V V
to  
resolve V V
the  
problem  
of  
millions  
of  
Palestinian  
refugees  
and  
their  
descendants  
.  

Abbas  
,  
a  
refugee  
himself  
from  
what  
is V V
today  
the  
northern  
Israeli  
city  
of  
Safed  
,  
called V V
the  
refugee  
issue V V
"  
very  
important V V
and  
very  
dangerous V V
.  
"  

Having V V
personally  
visited V V
the  
West  
Bank  
and  
Israel  
,  
I  
can  
say V V
that  
this  
new  
political

(  
Hat  
Tip V

Captain  
s  
Quarters  
)  

(  
BBC  
)  

The  
Palestinian  
militant  
organisation  
Hamas  
has V V
announced V V
an  
end V V
to  
rocket  
attacks V V
on  
Israel  
from  
the  
Gaza  
Strip  
after  
a  
weekend  
of  
escalating  V
violence  
.  

Up  
to  
40  
rockets  
had V V
been V V
fired V V
at  
Israel  
,  
weeks  
after  
its  
military  
withdrew V V
from  
the  
territory  
.  

In  
response V V
to  
the  
rockets  
,  
Israel  
resumed V V
its  
policy  
of  
targeting V V
militant  
leaders  
in  
air  
strikes V V
.  

Authorised V V
by  
Ariel  
Sharon  
to  
make V V
"  
unrestricted  
"  
strikes V V
,  
its  
military  
launched V V
new  
missile  
attacks V V
overnight  
.  

It  
looks V V
as  
if  
Hamas  
has V V
thrown V V
in  
the  
towel  
for  
this  
round V 
,  
unable V V
to  
take V V
the  
beating V V
the  
Israeli  
Defense  
Forces  
have V V
unleashed V V
upon  
this  
terrorist  
group  
.  

Mahmoud  
Zahar  
,  
Hamas  
's  
leader  
declared V V
the  
cease  
fire V V
after  
Israel  
killed V V
it's  
former  
leader  
,  
Muhammed  
Sheikh  
Khalil  
.  

Hamas  
has V V
become V V
rather  
unpopular  V
in  
Gaza  
,  
as  
many  
see V V
the  
Israeli  
air  
strikes V V
as  
a  
response V V
towards  
the  
rocket  
attacks V V
upon  
Israeli  
soil  
.  

Egypt  
had V V
a  
role  
to  
play V V
as  
they  
convinced V V
Hamas  
to  
end V V
the  
attacks V V
,  
although  
the  
same  
can  
not  
be V V
said V V
of  
Islamic  
Jihad  
.  

(  
Jerusalem  
Post  
)  

"  
We  
're V V
not  
happy V V
with  
Hamas  
's  
position  
at  
this  
stage  
and  
in  
light  
of  
the  
Israeli  
escalation V V
against  
the  
Palestinians  
,  
"  
commented V V
Khader  
Habib  
,  
a  
senior  
Islamic  
Jihad  
official  
.  

"  
But  
it  
seems V V
that  
Hamas  
has V V
its  
own  
political  
agenda  
.  
"  

[  
...  
]  

"  
The  
problem  
is V V
not  
with  
the  
Palestinian  
resistance  
groups  
but  
with  
Israel  
's  
scheme  
to  
destroy V V
the  
Palestinians  
'  
infrastructure  
,  
"  
Habib  
said V V
.  

"  
Hamas  
remains V V
targeted V V
by  
Israel  
,  
as  
in  
the  
past  
,  
and  
the  
Israeli  
occupation V V
does V V
not  
need V V
excuses V V
to  
pursue V V
its  
aggression V 
.  

Israel  
wants V V
to  
drive V V
the  
Palestinians  
toward  
civil  
war V V
.  
"  

Islamic  
Jihad  
has V V
refused V V
to  
recognized V V
the  
cease  
fire V V
,  
and  
hopes V V
to  
turn V V
the  
Gaza  
strip  
"  
into  
a  
vast  
battlefield  
.  
"  

Unless  
President  
Mahmoud  
Abbas  
steps V V
in  
,  
Gaza  
will  
probably  
look V V
like  
a  
battle  
field  
by  
the  
time  
Israel  
is V V
done V V
reminding V V
Hamas  
of  
their  
critical  
error V V
,  
although  
currently  
the  
only  
thing  
Abbas  
is V V
doing V V
is V V
lashing V V
out  
and  
refusing V V
to  
take V V
responsibility  
for  
his  
inability  
to  
act V V
.

trainer  
or  
something

He  
deserved V V
respect V V

the

I  
'm V V
writing V V
an  
essay  
for  
school

I  
need V V
to  
know V V
if  
the  
iPhone  
was V V
the  
first  
Smart  
Phone  
.  

Was  
it  
?  

Technically  
,  
blackberry  
was V V
because  
it  
was V V
the  
first  
with  
real  
email V V
and

But  
iPhone

No  
,  
it

But  
it  
did V V
revolutionize V V

Canon

It

!?????!!!!  

Go V V
with

It  
's V V
more  
compact  
,  
ISO  
6400

(  
SX40  
only  
3200

at

the

only

2.7  
.  

Both  
have V V
full  
1080  
video  
with  
stereo  
recording V V
,  
so  
that  
does V V
n't  
matter V V
.  

The  
S100  
has V V
a

Help V V

It  
's V V
my  
two  
year  
anniversary V V
in  
a  
few  
days  
and  
was V V
wondering V V
if  
somone  
could  
tell V V
me  
about  
a  
great  
restaurant  
in  
sf  
or  
other  
nearby  
cities  

I  
like V V
Hayes  
Street  
Grill  
....  
another  
plus  
,  
it  
's V V
right  
by  
Civic  
Center  
,  
so  
you  
can  
take V V
a  
romantic  
walk V V
around  
the  
Opera

,  
City

What

if  
you  
flew V V
the  
flag  
of  
South  
Vietnam  
in  
Modern  
day  
Vietnam  
?  

It  
would  
be V V
similar V V
to  
flying V V
the  
flag  
of  
the  
Third  
Reich  
in  
modern  
day  
Germany  
or  
in  
Israel  
.  

You  
would  
be V V
violating V V
the  
law  
.  

The  
police  
would  
make V V
you  
take V V
it  
down  
and  
you  
may  
face V V
fines  V
and  
imprisonment  V
(  
but  
definitely  
not  
execution V V
.  
)  

You  
will  
also  
face V V
the  
ire  
of  
most  
people  
there  
.  

They  
might  
be V V
imprisoned V V

Yes

it  
would  
be V V
an

Houseboat  
in  
Kerala  
is V V
a  
good  
option  
for  
you  
,  
all  
the  
best  
!!!  

Try V V
Varkala  
,  
it  
s V V
a  
ammazing  
and  
is V V
by  
the  
beach  
.  

People  
are V V
open  V
minded V V
thr  
since  
the  
place  
is V V
frequented V V
by  
Firangs  
.  

I  
have V V
a  
male  
and  
female  
cockatiel  
,  
and  
there  
are V V
2  
eggs  
in  
the  
bottom  
of  
the  
cage  
,  
will  
they  
hatch V V
?  

Most  
likely  
not  
,  
if  
there  
is V V
not  
a  
bird  
sitting V V
on  
the  
eggs  
.  

This  
is V V
hard V V
to  
tell V V
.  

Cockatiels  
can  
lay V V
unfertilized  
eggs  
as  
well  
.  

Just  
because  
you  
have V V
a  
male  
and  
female  
,  
it  
can  
not  
be V V
guaranteed V V
the  
two  
mated V V
.  

You  
can  
try V V
picking V V
up  
the  
eggs  
and  
holding V V
it  
up  
against  
a  
very  
bright  
light  
.  

If  
you  
see V V
a  
dark  
spot  
in  
the  
egg  
,  
that  
means V V
it  
is V V
fertilized  V
and  
will  
hatch V V
if  
cared V V
for  
properly  
.  

Have V V
fun V V
.  

Why  
is V V
the  
city  
called V V
Miramar  
?  

I  
'm V V
not  
sure V V
about  
the  
origin V V
of  
the  
name  
but  
they  
are V V
a  
lot  
of  
different  
cities  
with  
different  
and  
unique  
names  
like  
Miramar  
so  
it  
's V V
just  
a  
name  
.  

There  
's V V
lots  
of  
towns  
called V V
Miramar  
,  
it  
'd  
help V V
a  
lot  
if  
you  
listed V V
a  
state  
or  
some  
sort  
of  
context  
you  
're V V
looking V V
for  
it  
in  
.  

Here  
's V V
two  
examples  
:  

There  
's V V
a  
Miramar  
in  
Florida  
,  
just  
north  
of  
Miami  
.  

There  
's V V
also  
a  
Miramar  
in  
California  
,  
the  
site  
of  
a  
rather  
large  
Air  
Force  
Base  
...  

Miramar  
California  
is V V
a  
bit  
north  
of  
San  
Diego

taking V V
another  
plane  
ride V V

2  
)

the  
high  
mountain  
deserts  
.  

Alike  
...  
both  
were V V
fought V V
for  
securities  
reasons  
by  
the  
US  
(  
no  
matter  
what  
the  
liberal  
revisionist  
historians  
tell V V
you  
)  
.  

What  
is V V
your  
cat  
s  
name  
and  
why  
did V V
you  
name V V
him  
/  
her  
that  
?  

If  
you  
HAVE V V
a  
cat  
of  
course  
.  

My  
cat  
s  
name  
is V V
Twinky  
.  

When  
she  
was V V
a  
tiny  
little  
kitten  
she  
looked V V
like  
those  
twinky  
snack  
cakes  
.  

She  
is V V
a  
creme  
tabby  
and  
I  
've V V
had V V
her  
for  
over  
2  
years  
now  
.  

I  
have V V
a  
siamese  
lynx  
name V 
Star  
we  
called V V
her  
that  
because  
she  
has V V
a  
star  
pattern  
on  
her  
face  
.  

And  
she  
is V V
the  
STAR  
of  
the  
family  
.  

I  
love V V
her  
.  
:)  

I  
have V V
a  
Norwegian  
Forest  
Cat  
that  
is V V
named V V
Achilles  
bc  
as  
a  
kitten  
he  
always  
attacked V V
your  
feet  
when  
you  
walked V V
by  
!  

My  
cat  
s V 
Called V V
Frank  
because  
the  
year  
we  
got V V
him  
was V V
the  
year  
Frank  
Sinatra  
died V V

He  
also  
had V V
bright  
blue  
eyes  
like  
Frank  
Sinatra  
did V V
:)  

what  
does V V
it  
mean V V
when  
a  
veiled  
chameleon  
egg  
is V V
soft V V
?  

my  
female  
chameleon  
just  
laid V V
eggs  
yesterday  
and  
today  
some  
of  
the  
eggs  
are V V
soft V V
when  
i  
mean V V
soft  V
i  
mean V V
like  
not  
like  
ordinary  
chameleon  
eggs  
.  

They  
are V V
probably  
infertile  V
.  

If  
there  
is V V
no  
male  
they  
are V V
probably  
infertile  V
!  

If  
you  
take V V
a  
flash  
light  
and  
shine V V
it  
through  
the  
eggs  
and  
you  
see V V
nothing  
throw V V
them  
away  
!  

If  
you  
do V V
not  
they  
will  
start V V
to  
rot V V
!  

If  
she  
has V V
no  
male  
to  
fertilize V V
the  
eggs  
,  
the  
eggs  
will  
aways  
be V V
infertile  V
.  

if  
you  
do V V
have V V
a  
male  
but  
they  
are V V
not  
in  
the  
same  
cage  
or  
breeding V V
but  
you  
touch V V
him  
then  
her  
she  
will  
smell V V
his  
sent  V
and  
probably  
lay V V
eggs  
.  

Hope V V
she  
stops V V
laying V V
eggs  
because  
she  
will  
get V V
really  
skinny  V
!  

If  
she  
continues V V

Hope V V
this  
helps V V

Take V V
a  
ferry  
ride V V
!!!  

It  
's V V
an  
amazing  
experience V V
!  

Is V V
it  
better V V
to  
book V V
a  
cruise  
online  
or  
by  
a  
travel  
agent  
?  

First  
time  
to  
go V V
on  
A  
cruise  
any  
and  
all  
info  
is V V
appreciated V V

Personally  
,  
I  
do V V
n't  
find V V
a  
travel  
agent  
to  
be V V
of  
value  
to  
me  
as  
I  
am V V
willing V V
to  
put V V
in  
the  
time  
doing V V
research V V
on  
the  
internet  
.  

I  
have V V
not  
had V V
good  
experience V V
with  
travel  
agents  
.  

They  
do V V
n't  
seem V V
to  
know V V
anything  
but  
the  
hype  
they  
are V V
told V V
and  
the  
packages  
they  
have V V
available V V
to  
them  
.  

The  
one  
time  
I  
actually  
booked V V
through  
a  
travel  
agent  
I  
did V V
not  
get V V
all  
of  
the  
amenities  
I  
had V V
paid V V
for  
.  

The  
few  
times  
I  
have V V
consulted V V
with  
a  
travel  
agent  
I  
was V V
able V V
to  
find V V
the  
same  
for  
less  
on  
my  
own  
,  
and  
more  
options  
than  
what  
they  
were V V
selling V V
.  

So  
now  
I  
do V V
not  
bother V V
with  
them  
at  
all  
.  

best  
is V V
using V V

My  
Hamster  
escaped V V
....  
NEED V V
HELP V V
NOW  
!?  

okay  
....  
I  
have V V
a  
dog  
and  
my  
mother  
is V V
really  
really  
terrified V V
of  
hamsters  
.  

Well  
last  
night  
while  
I  
was V V
sleeping V V
,  
my  
hamster  
escaped V V
from  
his  
cage  
.  

He  
is V V
in  
my  
room  
,  
but  
there  
are V V
so  
many  
things  
inside  
there  
,  
I  
du V V
n  
no V V
what  
to  
do V V
.  

I  
have V V
lots  
of  
containers  
in  
there  
.  

Anybody  
give V V
me  
ideas  
like  
a  
trap  
or  
something  
?  

Find V V
him  
before  
he  
finds V V
the  
dog  
food  
.  

I  
'm V V
not  
kidding V V
,  
I  
once  
lost V V
a  
hamster  
in  
my  
house  
3  
months  
later  
I  
walk V V
down  
in  
the  
basement  
and  
it  
was V V
as  
big V V
as  
a  
rat  
.  

It  
had V V
been V V
eating V V
dog  
food  
the  
whole  
time  
.  

It  
was V V
huge V V
and  
scared V V
the  
crap  
out  
of  
me  
.  

Make V V
sure V V
he  
is V V
n't  
trapped V V
somewhere  
&  
put V V
a  
bowl  
of  
food  
out  
.  

He  
will  
come V V
and  
eat V V

Start V V
cleaning V V
and  
start V V
looking V V
.  

can  
i  
have V V
some  
indoor  
pet  
ideas  
please  
!!!!!!!!!!!!!?  

i  
want V V
a  
small  
indoor  
pet  
that  
my  
mother  
will  
let V V
me  
have V V
please  
help V V

i  
want V V
something  
cheap  
east  
to  
take V V
care V V
of  
and  
something  
to  
hopefully  
fit V V
in  
my  
room  

no  
pet  
is V V
really  
easy V V
to  
take V V
care V V
of  
.  

they  
all  
need V V
love V V
and  
attn  
,  
food  
,  
proper  
surroundings  
etc  
.  

the  
easiest  
thing  
would  
be V V
a  
fish  
-  
but  
u  
need V V
to  
clean V V
the  
tank  
weekly  
,  
feed V V
it  
the  
right  
amt  
,  
etc  
etc  
x  

Having V V
a  
pet  
is V V
n't  
easy V V
.  

You  
should  
treat V V
all  
pets  
like  
children  
.  

They  
require V V
a  
lot  
of  
attention V V
or  
they  
get V V
fussy  
and  
tear V V
stuff  
up  
.  

If  
you  
want V V
easy  
then  
go V V
with  
a  
gold  
fish  
or  
hamster  
.  

I  
would  
go V V
with  
a  
small  
rodent  
such  
as  
a  
mouse  
,  
rat  
,  
hamster  
or  
gerbil  
if  
you  
want V V
something  
you  
can  
handle V V
and  
hold V V
.  

Fish  
are V V
probably  
the  
easiest  
to  
take V V
care V V
of  
though  
.  

french  
male  
sensuality  
?  

I  
ve V V
been V V
dating V V
a  
man  
from  
brittany  
france  
for  
a  
couple  
of  
months  
now  
.  

He  
's V V
been V V
away  
for  
a  
week  
and  
I  
was V V
thinking V V
of  
waiting V V
for  
him  
in  
his  
apartment  
wearing V V
only  
his  
dress  
shirt  
.  

It  
s V V
still  
a  
fairly  
new  
relationship V V
and  
we  
have V V
nt  
had V V
sex V 
yet  
so  
it  
s V V
kind  
of  
a  
big  
deal V V
.  

I  
just  
do V V
nt  
want V V
to  
freak V V
him  
out  
or  
make V V
him  
feel V V
uncomfortable V 
.  

Is V V
it  
ok  
for  
a  
woman  
in  
french  
culture  
to  
make V V
the  
first  
move V V
?  

What  
do V V
french  
men  
find V V
sexy  V
?  

French  
women  
are V V
the  
ones  
to  
say V V
yes  
,  
the  
way V V
we  
say V V
it  
is V V
not  
usually  
as  
straigthforward  
as  
you  
propose V V
to  
do V V
.  

Why  
not  
wait V V
for  
him  
in  
a  
sexy  
dress  
with  
lunch  
or  
dinner  
,  
or  
a  
light  
snack  
at  
his  
house  
.  

And  
you  
take V V
it  
up  
from  
there  
.  

Just  
make V V
sure V V
that  
it  
is V V
a  
light  
meal  
with  
little  
alcohol  
.

Perfect  
since  
I  
'm V V
on  
a

But  
otherwise  
,  
it  
can  
feel V V
pricey  
for  
what  
you  
get V V
.  

Like V 
the  
sushi  
,  
do V V
n't  
like V V

service V V

There  
are V V
a

decent  
people  
working V V
there

but  
the

are V V
VERY  
dishonest V 
,  
as

as  
rude V 
,  
I  
have V V
yet  
to  
hear V V
the  
truth  
come V V
out  
of  
their  
mouths  
.  

Give V V
them  
a

and  
they  
're V V

How  
much  
better  
does V V
it  
get V V
?!  

I  
loved V V
the  
atmosphere  
here  
and  
the  
food  
is V V
good V V
,  
however  
the  
tables  
are V V
so  
close V V
together  
that  
it  
feels V V
very  
cramped  
.  

We  
were V V
made V V
to  
feel V V
very  
welcome V V

I  
love V V
walking V V
in  
and  
not  
being V V
hassled V V
.  

I  
was V V
there  
when  
they  
did V V
a  
free  
raffle  
in  
August  
and  
I  
won V V
a  
hard  
drive  V
!  

The  
reason  
I  
go V V
back  
is V V
because  
the  
employees  
are V V
sooooo  
nice V V
.  
”  

Horrible  
customer  
service V V
.  

I  
came V V
in  
to  
get V V
a  
nice  
gift  
for  
my  
wife  
.  

The  
one  
guy  
who  
was V V
there  
,  
I  
'm V V
guessing V V
was V V
the  
owner  
,  
was V V
probably  
the  
least  
helpful  
person  
I  
've V V
ever  
met V V
.  

But  
thankfully  
there  
are V V
other  
flowers  
shops  
around  
Norman  
.  

Pure  
Beauty  

What  
a  
joy  
to  
stroll V V
off  
historic

Road

Santa  
Fe  
into  
a  
gallery  
with  
a  
gorgeous  
diversity  
of  
art

Destiny  
Allison

!  

This  
is V V
one  
of  
my  
favorite  
places  
to  
eat V V
for  
lunch  
.  

They  
offer V V
a  
good  
portions  
at  
a  
great  
price V V
,  
it  
's V V
enough  V
food  
to  
fill V V
you  
up  
,  
but  
you  
do V V
n't  
ever  
feel V V
like  
you  
ate V V
too  
much  
.  

Plus  
,  
it  
's V V
super  
healthy V V

If  
you  
want V V
cheaply  
made  
glass  
from  
India  
and  
China  
,  
this  
is V V
not  
your  
place  
.  

These  
people  
only  
carry V V
the  
very  
best  
American  
blown  
glass  
.  

Their  
selection V V
is V V
top  
notch  
and  
the

Chuck  
and  
Gretchen  
were V V
very  
positive V V
,  
and  
when  
Alan  
's  
refused V V
to  
work V V
on  
my  
bike  
,  
Chuck  
came V V
right  
out  
and  
saw V V
the  
problem  
and  
did V V
what  
Alan  
's  
mechanic  
would  
n't  
do V V
.  

He  
worked V V
on  
it  
right  
on  
the  
back  
of  
my  
car  
.  

I  
am V V
extremely  
pleased V V

Quick  
and  
Cheap  

Walked V V
in  
and  
was V V
out  
ta  
there  
in  
10  
mins  
with  
a  
really  
good  
deal V V
i  
thought V V
i  
was V V
going V V
to  
be V V
paying V V
a  
lot  
because  
i  
had V V
a  
DUI  
but  
with  
my  
DUI  
and  
Sr  
-  
22  
they  
were V V
able V V
to  
get V V
me  
the  
best  
deal V V
out  
there  
.  

Is V V
not  
a  
service  V
office  

This  
is V V
a  
delivery  
office  
only  
and  
does V V
not  
take V V
walk  V
ins  
but  
they  
do V V
have V V
a  
blue  
box  
out  
front  
.  

Glad  
I  
called V V
before  
I  
arrived V V
with  
my  
box  
to  
ship V V
.  

Thought V V
adding V V
a  
comment V V
would  
save V V
someone  
the  
hassle V V
with  
a  
useless  
trip V V
there  
.  

the  
food  
is V V
mediocre  
at  
best  
.  

the  
waitress  
took V V
my  
name  
and  
then  
called V V
me  
that  
all  
night  
.  

not  
sure  
how  
I  
feel V V
about  
that  
one  
.  

it  
's V V
passable  V
as  
a  
pub  
,  
but  
the  
pizza  
is V V
not  
that  
great V V
.  

if  
you  
want V V
good  
pizza  
,  
go V V
to  
famoso  
.  

seriously  
.  

Anyone  
else  
find V V
it  
a  
little  
suspicious  V
that  
there  
are V V
not  
only  
20  
reviews V V
for  
this  
dentist  
(  
a  
HUGE  
number  
compared  
to  
the  
others  
in  
the  
area  
)  
,  
but  
that  
they  
all  
have V V
the  
same  
unique  
grammar  
structure  
?  

And  
they  
seem V V
to  
be V V
posted V V
at  
fairly  
regular  
intervals  
?  

Best  
YET  
!  

We  
go V V
to  
Japaneiro  
's

the  
time  
and

been V V
disappointed V 
!  

Wait  
staff  
is V V
always  
ready V V
to  
help V V
if  
you  
ca  
n't  
decide V V
(  
which  
happens V V
every  
time  
for  
me  
d  
/  
t  
the  
huge  
menu  
of  
rolls V V

Good

Harlan  
provides V V
great  
service V V
.  

He  
is V V
very  
knowledgeable V V
and  
took V V
the  
time  
to  
explain V V
the  
repairs V V
to  
me  
.  

The  
work V V
on  
my  
car  
was V V
done V V
quickly  
and  
I  
felt V V
I  
could  
trust V V
his  
work V V
.  

I  
have V V
nothing  
but  
fantastic  
things  
to  
say V V
.  

I  
highly  
recommend V V
his  
shop  
.  

Best  
in  
Memphis  

This  
shop  
is V V
by  
far  
the  
best  
I  
have V V
been V V
to  
.  

I  
have V V
a  
Saab  
...  
which  
everything  
is V V
expensive V V
on  
and  
they  
have V V
been V V
extrememly  
fair V V
and  
price V V
a  
lot  
lower  V
than  
any  
other  
shop  
I  
called V V
.  

They  
are V V
the  
only  
place  
I  
would  
take V V
my  
car  
peiod  
.  

Took V V
a  
laptop  
in  
for  
a  
video  
cable  
to  
be V V
replaced V V
.  

Everything  
except  
the  
display  
worked V V
fine  
before  
I  
took V V
it  
in  
.  

The  
video  
cable  
was V V
replaced V V
and  
suddenly  
the  
motherboard  
was V V
dead  
.  

Phone  
calls V V
were V V
n't  
returned V V
when  
promised V V
and  
the  
botched V 
repair V V
took V V
a  
week  
longer  
than  
promised V V
.  

We  
have V V
stayed V V
at  
Tanglewood  
for  
many  
years  
now  
.  

We  
go V V
over  
about  
5  
times  
a  
year  
.  

We  
have V V
never  
had V V
a  
problem  
with  
the  
cabins  
.  

They  
are V V
always  
so  
helpful V V
.  

The  
cabins  
have V V
always  
been V V
clean V V
.  

Helen  
is V V
a  
wonderful  
place  
to  
take V V
you  
family  
.  

We  
recommend V V
these  
cabins  
!  

Ca  
n't  
say V V
enough  

I  
used V V
to  
tan V V
down  
the  
street  
before  
I  
was V V
referred V V
to  
this  
place  
by  
one  
of  
my  
friends  
.  

WOW  
!  

I  
did V V
n't  
know V V
what  
I  
was V V
missing V V
.  

The  
lowest  
bed  
here  
is V V
better V V
than  
my  
last  
salon  
s  
highest  
level  
.  

Salon  
is V V
clean V V
and  
girls  
are V V
nice V V
.  

Great  
People  
and  
even  
better  
service V V
!  

Best  
to  
deal V V
with  
!  

In  
a  
few  
words  
...  
I  
'm V V
pleasantly  
surprised V V
that  
you  
can  
still  
find V V
"  
old  
school  
"  
service V V
out  
there  
where  
company  
care V V
more  
about  
good  
name  
and  
customers  
than  
their  
pockets  
...  

Highly  
recommended  
people  
/  
business  
.  

Thanks V V
Josh  
!  

Dentist  
you  
can  
trust V V

If  
possible  
I  
try V V
the  
services V V
on  
myself  
before  
I  
bring V V
in  
my  
son  
.  

Drs.  
Ali  
work V V
wonders V V
.  

Neither  
me  
nor  
my  
son  
have V V
n't  
had V V
a  
single  
cavity  
since  
we  
started V V
dental  
care V V
there  
.  

The  
team  
focus  V
is V V
prevention V V
and  
education V V
.  

That  
alone  
makes V V
them  
unique V V
.  

This  
is V V
not  
your  
usual  
cheap  
hotdog  
place  
.  

They  
offer V V
a  
large  
variety  
of  
quality  
hotdogs  
and  
hamburgers  
They  
also  
offer V V
veggie  
dogs  
.  

The  
fries  
are V V
of  
good  
quality  
,  
the  
staff  
is V V
friendly V V
.  

The  
atmosphere  
is V V
your  
typical  
indie  
outfit  
with  
old  
movie  
posters  
and  
memorabilia  
from  
the  
70's  
and  
80's  
.  

Over  
charged V 
.  

I  
used V V
my  
card  
to  
purchase V V
a  
meal  
on  
the  
menu  
and  
the  
total  
on  
my  
receipt  
was V V
$  
8.95  
but  
when  
I  
went V V
on  
line  
to  
check V V
my  
transaction V V
it  
show V V
$  
10.74  
.  

There  
is V V
something  
wrong  
or  
maybe  
the  
individual  
made V V
a  
mistake V V
but  
to  
me  
that  
is V V
not  
integrity  
.  

Elmira  
,  
you  
r V V
the  
best  
!  

All  
I  
can  
say V V
is V V
that  
Elmira  
you  
are V V
the  
best  
I  
ve V V
experienced V V
,  
never  
before  
has V V
the  
seamstress  
done V V
a  
perfect  
job  
until  
i  
met V V
you  
.  

I  
recommend V V
you  
to  
everyone  
in  
Calgary  
,  
as  
she  
is V V
a  
professional  
and  
the  
cost  
for  
her  
was V V
low V V
.  

5  
star  
detail  
job  

I  
took V V
my  
Mustang  
here  
and  
it  
looked V V
amazing V V
after  
they  
were V V
done V V
,  
they  
did V V
a  
great  
job  
,  
I  
'm V V
very  
satisfied  
with  
the  
results  
.  

The  
paint  
and  
wheels  
looked V V
like  
glass  
and  
the  
interior  
looked V V
new V V
!  

Also  
,  
they  
have V V
great  
customer  
service V V
and  
a  
very  
knowledgeable
