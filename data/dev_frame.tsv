From	
the	
AP	
comes	V.03
this	
story	
:	

President	
Bush	
on	
Tuesday	
nominated	V.01
two	
individuals	
to	
replace	V.01
retiring	
jurists	
on	
federal	
courts	
in	
the	
Washington	
area	
.	

Bush	
nominated	V.01
Jennifer	
M.	
Anderson	
for	
a	
15	
-	
year	
term	
as	
associate	
judge	
of	
the	
Superior	
Court	
of	
the	
District	
of	
Columbia	
,	
replacing	V.01
Steffen	
W.	
Graae	
.	

***	

Bush	
also	
nominated	V.01
A.	
Noel	
Anketell	
Kramer	
for	
a	
15	
-	
year	
term	
as	
associate	
judge	
of	
the	
District	
of	
Columbia	
Court	
of	
Appeals	
,	
replacing	V.01
John	
Montague	
Steadman	
.	

The	
sheikh	
in	
wheel	
-	
chair	
has	V.01
been	V.03
attacked	V.01
with	
a	
F	
-	
16	
-	
launched	
bomb	
.	

He	
could	
be	V.03
killed	V.01
years	
ago	
and	
the	
israelians	
have	V.03
all	
the	
reasons	
,	
since	
he	
founded	V.01
and	
he	
is	V.01
the	
spiritual	
leader	
of	
Hamas	
,	
but	
they	
did	V.01
n't	
.	

Today	
's	
incident	
proves	V.01
that	
Sharon	
has	V.01
lost	V.02
his	
patience	
and	
his	
hope	V.01
in	
peace	V.01
.	

Nervous	
people	
make	V.LV
mistakes	V.02
,	
so	
I	
suppose	V.01
there	
will	
be	V.02
a	
wave	V.04
of	
succesfull	
arab	
attacks	V.01
.	

A	
la	
guerre	
c'est	
comme	
a	
la	
guerre	
!	

In	
the	
eastern	
city	
of	
Baqubah	
,	
guerrillas	
detonated	V.01
a	
car	
bomb	
outside	
a	
police	
station	
,	
killing	V.01
several	
people	
.	

The	
US	
lost	V.02
yet	
another	
helicopter	
to	
hostile	
fire	V.01
near	
Habbaniyah	
in	
the	
Sunni	
heartland	
,	
but	
this	
time	
the	
crew	
was	V.01
safe	V.01
.	

In	
Fallujah	
,	
hundreds	
of	
demonstrators	
came	V.01
out	
against	
US	
troops	
when	
they	
briefly	
arrested	V.01
a	
yound	
newlywed	
bride	
.	

(	
I	
hope	V.01
that	
the	
US	
army	
got	V.01
an	
enormous	
amount	
of	
information	
from	
her	
relatives	
,	
because	
otherwise	
this	
move	V.01
was	V.01
a	
bad	
,	
bad	
tradeoff	V.03
)	
.	

The	
US	
troops	
fired	V.01
into	
the	
hostile	
crowd	
,	
killing	V.01
4	
.	

It	
seems	V.01
clear	V.06
to	
me	
that	
the	
manhunt	
for	
high	
Baath	
officials	
in	
the	
Sunni	
heartland	
is	V.03
being	V.03
done	V.02
wrong	
,	
or	
at	
least	
in	
ways	V.01
that	
are	V.01
bad	V.04
for	
US	
standing	
with	
local	
Iraqis	
.	

Google	
has	V.01
finally	
had	V.03
an	
analyst	
day	
--	
a	
chance	V.02
to	
present	V.01
the	
company	
's	
story	
to	
the	
(	
miniscule	
number	
of	
)	
people	
who	
have	V.01
n't	
heard	V.01
it	
.	

Usually	
,	
these	
are	V.01
just	
a	
chance	V.02
for	
the	
suckups	
to	
suck	V.04
up	
,	
but	
this	
time	
people	
are	V.01
actually	
concerned	V.01
about	
the	
company	
's	
plans	V.01
.	

They	
work	V.01
on	
Wall	
Street	
,	
after	
all	
,	
so	
when	
they	
hear	V.01
a	
company	
who's	
stated	
goals	
include	V.01
"	
Do	V.01
n't	
be	V.01
evil	V.01
,	
"	
they	
imagine	V.01
a	
company	
who's	
eventually	
history	
will	
be	V.01
"	
Do	V.01
n't	
be	V.01
profitable	
.	
"	

It	
's	V.01
not	
quite	
as	
freewheeling	
an	
environment	
as	
you	
'd	
imagine	V.01
:	
Sergey	
Brin	
has	V.01
actually	
created	V.01
a

proof	V.01

the

do	V.02

projects	
on

is	V.01
a

idea

Read	V.01
the	
entire	
article	
;	
there	
's	V.02
a	
punchline	
,	
too

My	
opinion	
piece	
on	
the	
implications	V.01
of	
Arafat	
's	
passing	V.20
for	
al	
-

has	V.01
appeared	V.01
at	
Newsday	
.	

Excerpt	
:	

"	
Arafat	
's	
secular	
nationalism	
was	V.01
supple	V.01
enough	V.01
to	
compromise	V.01
with	
Israel	
and	
to	
imagine	V.01
a	
two	
-	
state	
solution	V.01
,	
even	
if	
the	
road	
of	
negotiations	V.01
remained	V.01
rocky	
.	

The	
continued	
Israeli	
colonization	V.01
of	
the	
occupied	
Palestinian	
territories	
during	
the	
1990s	
helped	V.01
,	
along	
with	
terrorist	
attacks	V.01
by	
radical	
groups	
such	
as	
Hamas	
,	
to	
derail	V.01
the	
peace	
process	V.02
,	
which	
Sharon	
had	V.01
always	
opposed	V.01
.	

Arafat	
's	
death	V.01
creates	V.01
a	
vacuum	
in	
Palestinian	
leadership	V.02
that	
will	
not	
soon	
be	V.03
filled	V.01
.	

Sharon	
's	
assassination	V.01
of	
major	
Hamas	
leaders	
has	V.01
also	
weakened	V.01
authority	
structures	
in	
that	
party	
.	

If	
the	
Israelis	
and	
the	
Palestinian	
leadership	V.02
can	
not	
find	V.01
a	
way	V.01
to	
reinvigorate	V.01
the	
peace	
process	V.02
,	
cells	
of	
radical	
young	
Palestinians	
may	
grow	V.04
up	
that	
look	V.01
to	
bin	
Laden	
for	
their	
cues	
.	

Even	
if	
local	
Palestinian	
leaders	
remain	V.01
strong	V.02
enough	V.01
to	
keep	V.02
al	
-	
Qaida	
out	
,	
the	
festering	V.01
Israeli	
-	
Palestinian	
struggle	V.02
remains	V.01
among	
the	
best	
recruiting	
posters	
for	
al

Qaida	
with	
young	
Muslim	
men

Resolving	V.01
this	
conflict	V.01
would	
be	V.01
the	
most	
effective	
weapon	
the	
United

could	
deploy	V.01
in	
its	
war	V.01

US

In

apparently

some

Ever	
since	
the	
first

about

most	
investors	
have	V.01
feared	V.01
that

a	
ridiculously	
high

,	
even	
with

spectacularly	
profitable	
business	
model	V.01
and	
some	
nearly	
flawless	
execution	V.02
,	
the	
price	V.01
would	
be	V.01
too	
high	V.02
for	
investors	
to	
make	V.LV

We	
've	V.01
moved	V.08

That	
's	V.01
overstating	V.01

I	
know	V.01

What	
they

the	
efficient

the

Remember	V.01
when	
a	
whole	
lot

had	V.02
to	
die	V.01
because	
a	
Swedish	
newspaper	
printed	V.01
those	
cartoons	
of

Prophet	
Mohammed

wants	V.01

to	
do	V.02
their	
best	
by	
depicting	V.01

Holocaust

Amazingly	
,	
these	
idiots	
think	V.01
a

comparable	V.02

told	V.01

opening	
ceremony	
of	
the	
month

long	
fair	
in	
Tehran

Contemporary	
Art

He	
added	V.01
that	
around	
1,100	
cartoons	
were	V.03
submitted	V.01
by	
participants	
from	
more	
than	
60	
countries	
and	
that	
more	
than	
200	
are	V.01
on

He	
said	V.01
the	
top	
three	
cartoons	
will	
be	V.03
announced	V.01
on	
September	
2	
,	
with	
the

awarded	V.01
prizes	
of	
12,000

8,000	
and	
5,000	
dollars	
respectively

This	
cute	
little	
stunt	V.02
is	V.03
only	
going	V.04
to	
prove	V.01
just	
how	
fanatic

they	
saw	V.01

highly	
doubt	V.01

look	V.02

them

the	
Fallujah	
compaign

In	
Iraqi	
society

PM	
Allawi	
is	V.01
responsible	V.03
for	
protecting	V.01
his	
clan	
,	
including	
especially	
his	
first	
cousins	
,	
so	
this	
kidnapping	V.01
makes	V.02
him	
look	V.02
weak	V.02
and	
brings	V.01
substantial	
shame	V.02
on	
him	
.	

The	
US	
Marines	
took	V.01
most	
of	
Fallujah	
Wednesday	
,	
but	
still	
face	V.01
pockets	
of	
resistance	V.01

If	
Samarra	
and	
other	
cities	
are	V.01
any	
guide	
,	
those	
pockets	
of	
resistance	V.01
could	
go	V.15
on	
bedeviling	V.01
the

some	
time

The	
intrepid	
Ed

has	V.03
more	
on	
the	
Sunni	
boycott	V.01
of	
the

He	
reports	V.01
that	
the	
Iraqi	
Islamic

which	
had	V.01
earlier	
been	V.03
absolutely	
committed	V.01
to	
getting	V.05
out	
the

vote	V.01

is	V.03
now	
wavering	V.01
and	
saying	V.01
their	
position	
will	
depend	V.01
on	
the	
situation

The	
outbreak	V.01
of	
demonstrations	V.01
and	
violence	
throughout	
the	
Sunni	
Arab	
regions	
on	
Wednesday	
did	V.01
not	
bode	V.01
well	
for	
Sunni	
participation	V.01
in	
the	
January	
elections	V.01

Jim

more

The	
hottest	
item	
on	
Christmas	
wish	
lists	
this	
year	
is	V.01
nuclear	
weapons	
.	

Al	
-	
Qaeda	
wants	V.01
them	
,	
Iran	
wants	V.01
them	
,	
Russia	
wants	V.01
the	
better	
ones	
,	
and	
all	
the	
US	
wants	V.01
is	V.01
to	
give	V.01
them	
all	
a	
piece	
of	
coal	
.	

For	
the	
last	
few	
years	
there	
have	V.01
been	V.02
tensions	V.01
with	
Iran	
’s	
nuclear	
program	
with	
word	
coming	V.03
this	
week	
that	
a	
deal	V.01
was	V.03
reached	V.01
through	
the	
European	
Union	
that	
meets	V.05
with	
the	
approval	V.01
of	
the	
International	
Atomic	
Energy	
Agency	
.	

At	
the	
same	
time	
,	
an	
Iranian	
Opposition	
Group	
released	V.01
what	
they	
call	V.01
proof	V.01
of	
a	
covert	
nuclear	
weapons	
program	
.	

Arial	
photos	V.01
,	
loose	
connections	V.01
to	
AQ	
Kahn	
and	
Libya	
make	V.07
up	
the	
evidence	
that	
the	
group	
presented	V.01
.	

Russia	
also	
announced	V.01
that	
it	
was	V.03
seeking	V.01
and	
building	V.01
the	
best	
nukes	
the	
world	
’s	V.03
ever	
seen	V.01
.	

President	
Vladimir	
Putin	
said	V.01
Russia	
is	
will	
have	V.03
new	
nuclear	
weapons	
that	
other	
countries	
do	V.01
not	
and	
will	
not	
have	V.03
.	

With	
the	
demand	V.01
so	
high	V.02
,	
the	
question	V.01
arises	V.02
on	
to	
who	
should	
be	V.01
or	
has	V.03
the	
right	V.05
to	
be	V.01
the	
Santa	
of	
nuclear	
weapons	
.	

Right	
now	
that	
seems	V.01
to	
be	V.01
the	
US	
,	
EU	
,	
and	
IAEA	
.	

But	
not	
always	
do	V.01
those	
three	
agree	V.01
,	
and	
not	
always	
are	V.01
their	
decisions	V.01
equal	V.01
.	

The	
US	
has	V.01
strongly	
opposed	V.01
a	
nuclear	
weapons	
program	
of	
Iran	
,	
yet	
Israel	
,	
which	
to	
this	
day	
has	V.01
never	
officially	
said	V.01
that	
they	
posses	V.01
nuclear	
weapons	
,	
ranks	V.01
around	
fifth	
in	
nuclear	
strength	
.	

It	
is	V.03
estimated	V.01
that	
Israel	
has	V.03
over	
200	
nuclear	
weapons	
yet	
neither	
the	
US	
nor	
any	
of	
her	
allies	
expresses	V.01
the	
slightest	
concern	V.01
.	

North	
Korea	
’s	
Kim	
Jong	
Ill	
also	
has	V.03
the	
bomb	
at	
the	
top	
of	
his	
list	
and	
Santa	
seems	V.01
to	
have	V.01
already	
come	V.01
a	
few	
years	
ago	
.	

It	
is	V.03
rumored	V.01
that	
North	
Korea	
has	V.03
at	
least	
a	
couple	
nuclear	
weapons	
.	

But	
getting	V.05
past	
who	
should	
get	V.01
them	
,	
is	V.01
who	
has	V.03
them	
,	
and	
who	
is	V.01
really	
close	V.10
.	

The	
case	V.03
against	
Iran	
has	V.LV
a	
feeling	V.01
of	
Déjà	
vu	
.	

Arial	
photos	V.01
of	
the	
lab	
were	V.01
uranium	
is	V.03
being	V.03
enriched	V.01
,	
somewhat	
like	
those	
of	
chemical	
weapons	
stockpiles	
in	
Iraq	
.	

America	
cried	V.01
wolf	
in	
Iraq	
,	
and	
what	
’s	V.01
scary	V.03
is	V.01
that	
sooner	
or	
later	
,	
that	
wolf	
will	
probably	
get	V.01
us	
.	

I	
ran	V.07
across	
this	
item	
on	
the	
Internet	
.	

Sooooo	
.	

The	
United	
States	
goes	V.02
into	
a	
war	
zone	
and	
evacuates	V.01
a	
bunch	
of	
U.S.	
citizens	
(	
most	
of	
whom	
were	V.01
"	
dual	
-	
citizens	
"	
)	
.	

Then	
,	
eschewing	V.01
normal	
procedure	V.01
,	
the	
Department	
of	
State	
waived	V.01
the	
fees	
that	
they	
charge	V.01
for	
evacuating	V.01
U.S.	
citizen	
.	

Why	
?	

To	
pander	V.01
to	
the	
mythical	
"	
Arab	
street	
"	
,	
of	
course	
.	

Now	
,	
I	
would	
argue	V.01
that	
one	
could	
have	V.01
reasonably	
predicted	V.01
that	
some	
form	
of	
military	
violence	
was	V.01
likely	V.01
to	
occur	V.01
in	
Lebanon	
(	
considering	V.02
that	
the	
country	
has	V.01
been	V.03
experiencing	V.01
some	
form	
of	
conflict	V.01
for	
approximately	
the	
last	
32	
years	
)	
.	

In	
other	
words	
,	
those	
Americans	
were	V.01
there	
by	
their	
own	
choice	V.01
,	
mired	V.01
in	
a	
situation	
that	
was	V.01
totally	
predictable	V.02
.	

Yet	
we	
did	V.01
n't	
charge	V.01
them	
for	
the	
evacuation	V.01
.	

This	
is	V.01
unlike	
the	
situation	
last	
year	
in	
Asia	
when	
we	
evacuated	V.01
U.S.	
citizens	
from	
areas	
that	
were	V.03
hit	V.01
by	
the	
tsunami	V.01
-	
a	
phenomenon	
that	
is	V.01
much	
less	
predictable	V.02
than	
the	
Hezbollah	
-	
provoked	
destruction	V.01
that	
rained	V.01
down	
on	
Lebanon	
.	

And	
what	
do	V.01
we	
get	V.01
for	
this	
effort	V.01
?	

A	
lawsuit	
.	

That	
's	V.01
right	V.06
,	
folks	
.	

The	
American	
-	
Arab	
Discrimination	
Committee	
is	V.03
suing	V.02
Condoleeza	
Rice	
and	
Donald	
Rumsfeld	
,	
charging	V.06
that	
they	
mismanaged	V.01
the	
evacuation	
efforts	V.01
.	

Here	
's	V.01
an	
excerpt	
from	
the	
article	
:	

Nina	
Chahine	
,	
19	
,	
who	
with	
her	
family	
was	V.01
among	
the	
named	
plaintiffs	
in	
the	
lawsuit	
,	
said	V.01
her	
wedding	V.01
in	
the	
southern	
city	
of	
Tyre	
was	V.03
set	V.02
for	
July	
13	
.	

The	
wedding	V.01
had	V.02
to	
be	V.03
postponed	V.01
as	
family	
members	
fled	V.05
the	
outbreak	V.01
of	
the	
war	V.01
,	
she	
said	V.01
.	

"	
We	
were	V.01
on	
the	
road	
and	
the	
first	
bridge	
was	V.03
bombed	V.01
and	
we	
drove	V.01
home	
and	
all	
the	
other	
bridges	
were	V.03
bombed	V.01
and	
there	
was	V.02
absolutely	
no	
way	V.01
for	
us	
to	
get	V.05
home	
,	
"	
Chahine	
told	V.01
reporters	
outside	
federal	
court	
in	
Detroit	
.	

"	
We	
were	V.01
all	
American	
citizens	
and	
there	
was	V.02
no	
way	V.01
that	
anybody	
helped	V.01
us	
.	

No	
communications	V.01
nothing	
.	

I	
was	V.01
on	
my	
way	V.01
to	
my	
wedding	V.01
fearing	V.01
death	V.01
,	
basically	
.	
"	

Chahine	
said	V.01
her	
immediate	
family	
spent	V.01
about	
$	
20,000	
to	
return	V.01
to	
Detroit	
via	
Syria	
and	
Jordan	
.	

Dear	
Nina	
,	

Here	
's	V.01
a	
tip	V.05
:	
Do	V.01
n't	
get	V.03
married	V.01
in	
countries	
that	
house	V.01
illegal	
militias	
that	
attack	V.01
other	
countries	
and	
hence	
are	V.01
likely	V.01
to	
come	V.04
under	
counter-attack	
!	

Crap	
like	
this	
sure	
makes	V.02
me	
want	V.01
to	
rush	V.01
right	
out	
and	
rescue	V.01
people	
from	
dilemmas	
of	
their	
own	
making	V.01
.	

Though	
I	
am	V.01
loathe	
to	
quote	V.01
other	
writers	
at	
legnth	
in	
this	
space	
,	
this	
little	
bit	
from	
Dan	
Froomkin	
's	
"	
White	
House	
Briefing	
"	
column	
in	
the	
WashPost	
today	
is	V.01
just	
too	
good	V.02
to	
pass	V.13
up	
(	
read	V.01
the	
whole	
column	
here	
)	
:	

At	
the	
Ask	V.01
the	
President	
event	
on	
Friday	
,	
one	
of	
the	
questions	V.01
was	V.01
about	
whether	
Bush	
has	V.LV
any	
thoughts	V.01
about	
his	
memoirs	
.	

This	
is	V.01
one	
example	
of	
what	
happens	V.01
when	
Bush	
gets	V.LV
a	
question	V.01
that	
he	
has	V.01
n't	
anticipated	V.01
.	

"	
Q	
Thank	V.01
you	
--	
I	
was	V.03
wondering	V.01
,	
there	
's	V.02
a	
lot	
of	
talk	V.01
right	
now	
about	
memoirs	
being	V.03
written	V.01
with	
the	
former	
President	
.	

After	
you	
are	V.03
elected	V.01
in	
2004	
,	
what	
will	
your	
memoirs	
say	V.01
about	
you	
,	
what	
will	
the	
title	
be	V.01
,	
and	
what	
will	
the	
main	
theme	
say	V.01
?	

"	
THE	
PRESIDENT	
:	
I	
appreciate	V.02
that

Laughter

There	
is	V.02
a	
painting	V.02
on	
my	
wall	
in	
the	
Oval

first	
of	
all	
,	
I	
do	V.01
n't	
know	V.01

I	
'm	V.03
just	
speculating	V.01
now	
.	

I	
really	
have	V.01
n't	
thought	V.01
about	
writing	V.01
a	
book

My	
life	
is	V.01
too	
complicated	V.01
right	
now	
trying	V.01
to	
do	V.02
my	
job

But	
if	
--	
there	
's	V.02
a	
painting	V.02
on	
the	
wall	
in	
the	
Oval	
Office	
that	
shows	V.01
a	
horseman	
charging	V.02
up	
a	
steep	
cliff	
,	
and	
there	
are	V.02
at	
least	
two	
other	
horsemen	
following	V.01
.	

It	
's	V.01
a	
Western	
scene	
by	
a	
guy	
named	V.01
W.H.S.	
Koerner	
called	V.01
'	
A	
Charge	
to

It	
's	V.01

a	
guy	
named	V.01
Joe

in	
July	
of	
1977

Four	
months	
later

we	
were	V.03

So	
he	
's	V.03

can	
make	V.LV
good	
decisions	V.01

Applause

"	
And	
so	
we	
sang	V.01
this	
hymn

this	
is	V.01

long	
story

to	
get	V.05

your

talks	V.01
about	
serving	V.01
something	
greater	
than	
yourself	
in	
life

I

which	
I	
try	V.01

best

Now	
that

I	
have	V.02
to	
wonder	V.01

acquiring	V.01
Firefox	
.	

It	
is	V.01
true	V.01
that	
Google	
has	V.01
been	V.01
in	
acquisition	
mode	
.	

They

Zipdash	
,	
Applied	
Semantics	
,	
Picasa	
,	
Blogger	
,	
and	
satellite	
imaging	V.01

so	
why	
not	
Firefox	
?	

I	
have	V.03
no	
inside	
information	
,	
but	
I	
have	V.01
been	V.03
following	V.01
links	
today	
that	
strongly	
indicate	V.01
that	
Google	
is	V.01
damn	
serious	V.01
about	
securing	V.01
permanent	
control	V.01
of	
the	
leading	
edge

technology	
in

Ben	
Goodger	
is	V.01
the	
lead	
engineer	
for

He	
announced	V.01
this	
in	
January	
:	

As	
of	
January

2005

my

changed	V.01
from	
The	
Mozilla	
Foundation	
to	
Google	
,	
Inc.	
of	
Mountain

,	
California

My	
role	
with	
Firefox	
and	
the	
Mozilla	
project	
will	
remain	V.01
largely	
unchanged	V.01
,	
I	
will	
continue	V.01
doing	V.LV
much	
the	
same	
work	V.01
as	
I	
have	V.01
described	V.01
above	
-	
with	
the	
new	
goal	
of	
successful	
1.1	
,	
1.5	
and	
2.0	
releases	V.01

I	
remain	V.01
devoted	
full

time	
to	
the	
advancement	
of	
Firefox	
,	
the	
Mozilla	
platform	
and	
web	
browsing	V.01
in	
general

He	
also	
announced	V.01
this	
in

Following	
on	
the	
heels	
of	
Ben	
's	
annoucement	
yesterday

I	
thought	V.01
I	
'd	
post	V.01
that	
I	
have	V.01
joined	V.04

as	
well

Like

Ben	
made	V.LV
another	
announcement	V.01
on	
March	
28	
,	
2005	
:	

I	
want	V.01
to	
use	V.01
this	
opportunity	
to	
welcome	V.01
Brian	
Ryner	
to	
Google	
!	

Brian	
has	V.01
been	V.01
one	
of	
the	
most	
crucial	
elements	
to	
the	
success	V.01
of	
Mozilla	
software	
over	
the	
past	
few	
years	
,	
...	

Great	
to	
have	V.03
you	
on	
board	
!	

Now	
,	
none	
of	
this	
has	V.01
been	V.03
confirmed	V.01
by	
Google	
at	
the	
present	
time	
,	
but	
it	
's	V.01
an	
old	
adage	
that	
you	
follow	V.01
the	
money	
to	
see	V.01
who	
is	V.01
behind	
something	
.	

In	
this	
case	V.04
,	
following	V.01
the	
talent	
leads	V.03
me	
to	
think	V.01
that	
Google	
will	
be	V.03
making	V.LV
an	
announcement	V.01
this	
year	
that	
formalizes	V.01
the	
Google	
-	
Mozilla	
/	
Firefox	
relationship	V.03
.	

If	
you	
have	V.01
not	
already	
seen	V.01
the	
Flash	
movie	
Epic	
,	
you	
should	
take	V.01
a	
few	
minutes	
and	
view	V.02
the	
future	
history	
of	
media	
as	
conceived	V.01
by	
Robin	
Sloan	
and	
Matt	
Thompson	
,	
with	
music	
by	
Aaron	
McLeran	
.	

In	
this	
movie	
Google	
and	
Amazon	
(	
GOOGLEZON	
)	
create	V.01
a	
brave	
new	
world	
of	
media	
in	
2008	
.	

This	
is	V.01
one	
thought	
-	
provoking	
film	
.	

Every	
move	V.02
Google	
makes	V.LV
brings	V.01
this	
particular	
future	
closer	
.	

Just	
one	
small	
commment	
-	
it	
's	V.01
not	
possible	V.01
,	
as	
far	
as	
I	
know	V.01
,	
for	
Google	
to	
"	
Aquire	V.01
"	
Firefox	
.	

They	
already	
have	V.03
rights	V.05
to	
take	V.01
it	
,	
alter	V.01
it	
,	
and	
release	V.01
those	
changes	V.01
to	
the	
world	
-	
this	
is	V.01
what	
the	
whole	
open	
source	
thing	
is	V.01
about	
.	

I	
'm	V.01
inclined	V.01
to	
say	V.01
that	
google	
is	V.03
doing	V.02
what	
they	
can	
to	
both	
shape	V.01
and	
support	V.01
the	
growth	
of	
the	
most	
popular	
non-Microsoft	
browser	
out	
there	
-	
by	
taking	V.21
on	
the	
leading	
lights	
in	
Firefox	
development	V.02
,	
they	
're	V.03
ensuring	V.01
the	
continued	
life	
of	
the	
project	
,	
and	
ensuring	V.01
(	
not	
that	
I	
think	V.01
they	
need	V.01
to	
)	
that	
their	
voice	V.01
will	
be	V.03
heard	V.01
admidst	
the	
higher	
echelons	
of	
the	
firefox	
development	V.02
team	
.	

It	
's	V.01
this	
sort	
of	
enlightened	
self	
interest	V.01
that	
keeps	V.02
large	
open	
source	
projects	
alive	V.01
.	

Fascinating	
viewpoint	
of	
the	
future	
in	
Epic	
.	

Thanks	V.01
for	
the	
link	
.	

Malach	
,	
What	
you	
say	V.01
makes	V.LV
sense	V.02
.	

Acquiring	V.01
open	
source	
talent	
gives	V.01
a	
company	
an	
inexpensive	
way	V.01
of	
influencing	V.01
and	
anticipating	V.01
the	
direction	
an	
open	
source	
project	
will	
go	V.01
.	

It	
probably	
gives	V.01
more	
bang	
for	
the	
buck	
than	
acquiring	V.01
a	
private	
company	
and	
having	V.02
to	
handle	V.01
the	
inevitable	
culture	
clashes	V.01
and	
process	
mis-matches	
.	

The	
Coalition	
decision	V.01
to	
provoke	V.01
a	
fight	V.01
with	
Muqtada	
al	
-	
Sadr	
's	
movement	V.07
only	
three	
months	
before	
the	
Coalition	
Provisional	
Authority	
goes	V.08
out	
of	
business	
has	V.02
to	
be	V.03
seen	V.01
as	
a	
form	
of	
gross	
incompetence	
in	
governance	V.01
.	

How	
did	V.01
the	
CPA	
get	V.05
to	
the	
point	
where	
it	
has	V.01
turned	V.02
even	
Iraqi	
Shiites	
,	
who	
were	V.01
initially	
grateful	V.01
for	
the	
removal	V.01
of	
Saddam	
Hussein	
,	
against	
the	
United	
States	
?	

Where	
it	
risks	V.01
fighting	V.01
dual	
Sunni	
Arab	
and	
Shiite	
insurgencies	
simultaneously	
,	
at	
a	
time	
when	
US	
troops	
are	V.03
rotating	V.01
on	
a	
massive	
scale	
and	
hoping	V.01
to	
downsize	V.01
their	
forces	
in	
country	
?	

At	
a	
time	
when	
the	
Spanish	
,	
Thai	
and	
other	
contingents	
are	V.01
already	
committed	V.01
to	
leaving	V.11
,	
and	
the	
UN	
is	V.01
reluctant	V.01
to	
get	V.03
involved	V.01
?	

One	
answer	V.01
is	V.01
that	
the	
Pentagon	
prevented	V.01
the	
State	
Department	
from	
running	V.01
the	
CPA	
.	

State	
is	V.01
the	
body	
with	
experience	V.01
in	
international	
affairs	
and	
administration	V.01
.	

The	
civilians	
in	
the	
Department	
of	
Defense	
only	
know	V.01
how	
to	
blow	V.06
things	
up	
.	

Rumsfeld	
,	
Wolfowitz	
and	
Feith	
staffed	V.01
the	
CPA	
with	
Neoconservatives	
,	
most	
of	
whom	
had	V.LV
no	
administrative	
experience	V.01
,	
no	
Arabic	
,	
and	
no	
respect	V.01
for	
Muslim	
culture	
(	
or	
knowledge	
about	
it	
)	
.	

They	
actively	
excluded	V.01
State	
Department	
Iraq	
hands	
like	
Tom	
Warrick	
.	

(	
Only	
recently	
have	V.01
a	
few	
experienced	
State	
Department	
Arabists	
been	V.03
allowed	V.01
in	
to	
try	V.01
to	
begin	V.02
mopping	V.01
up	
the	
mess	
.	
)	

The	
Neocons	
in	
the	
CPA	
have	V.03
all	
sorts	
of	
ulterior	
motives	
and	
social	
experiments	V.01
they	
want	V.01
to	
impose	
on	
the	
Iraqi	
people	
,	
including	
Polish	
-	
style	
economic	
shock	V.01
therapy	
,	
some	
sort	
of	
sweetheart	
deal	V.01
for	
Israel	
,	
and	
maybe	
even	
breaking	V.08
the	
country	
up	
into	
three	
parts	
.	

The	
Washington	
Monthly	
's	
Who	
's	V.01
Who	
of	
Neocons	
in	
Iraq	
helps	V.01
explain	V.01
the	
extreme	
incompetence	
and	
possibly	
double	
-	
dealing	V.01
of	
many	
in	
the	
CPA	
.	

Sept.	
11	
Commission	
member	
Philip	
Zelikow	
,	
who	
is	V.01
close	V.10
to	
the	
Bush	
administration	V.01
,	
admitted	V.01
on	
Sept.	
10	
,	
2002	
,	
that	
the	
ulterior	
motive	
of	
the	
Bush	
administration	V.01
for	
the	
Iraq	
War	
was	V.01
to	
"	
protect	V.01
Israel	
,	
"	
according	
to	
the	
Asian	
Times	
.	

I	
have	V.01
long	
been	V.01
a	
trenchant	
critic	
of	
the	
Sadrists	
.	

But	
they	
have	V.01
n't	
been	V.01
up	
to	
anything	
extraordinary	
as	
far	
as	
I	
can	
see	V.01
in	
recent	
weeks	
.	

Someone	
in	
the	
CPA	
sat	V.02
down	
and	
thought	V.02
up	
ways	V.01
to	
stir	V.02
them	
up	
by	
closing	V.01
their	
newspaper	
and	
issuing	V.01
28	
arrest	
warrants	
and	
taking	V.06
in	
people	
like	
Yaqubi	
.	

This	
is	V.01
either	
gross	
incompetence	
or	
was	V.03
done	V.02
with	
dark	
ulterior	
motives	
that	
can	
scarcely	
be	V.03
guessed	V.01
at	
.	

There	
is	V.02
a	
classical	
logical	
fallacy	
,	
post	
hoc	
ergo	
propter	
hoc	
(	
Z	
happens	V.01
after	
X	
,	
therefore	
Z	
is	V.03
caused	V.01
by	
X	
)	
,	
and	
I	
keep	V.02
revising	V.01
this	
posting	V.01
this	
evening	
because	
I	
do	V.01
n't	
want	V.01
to	
fall	V.10
into	
it	
.	

But	
sometimes	
,	
of	
course	
,	
when	
Z	
happens	V.01
after	
X	
it	
is	V.01
because	
of	
X	
.	

So	
I	
may	
as	
well	
just	
come	V.09
out	
with	
it	
:	
It	
is	V.01
pretty	
suspicious	
,	
given	
the	
Neocon	
predominance	
in	
the	
CPA	
and	
in	
the	
upper	
reaches	
of	
the	
Defense	
Department	
that	
on	
April	
2	
AP	
reported	V.01
of	
Muqtada	
:	

'	
A	
radical	
Shiite	
Muslim	
cleric	
has	V.01
expressed	V.01
solidarity	
with	
the	
militant	
Palestinian	
group	
Hamas	
and	
said	V.01
that	
he	
should	
be	V.03
considered	V.01
the	
group	
's	
"	
striking	
arm	
"	
in	
Iraq	
.	

"	
I	
have	V.01
said	V.01
and	
I	
repeat	V.01
my	
expression	V.01
of	
solidarity	
which	
Hassan	
Nasrallah	
called	V.03
for	
to	
stand	V.11
with	
Hamas	
,	
"	
Shiite	
cleric	
Muqtada	
al	
-	
Sadr	
said	V.01
Friday	
in	
a	
reference	V.01
to	
Nasrallah	
,	
the	
leader	
of	
the	
militant	
Lebanese	
Shiite	
group	
Hezbollah	
.	

Last	
month	
,	
Nasrallah	
announced	V.01
that	
his	
party	
would	
close	V.01
ranks	
with	
Hamas	
.	

"	
Let	V.01
(	
Hamas	
)	
consider	V.01
me	
their	
striking	
arm	
in	
Iraq	
because	
the	
fate	
of	
Iraq	
and	
Palestine	
is	V.01
the	
same	
,	
"	
al	
-	
Sadr	
said	V.01
during	
a	
Friday	
prayer	
sermon	
in	
Kufa	
,	
his	
home	
base	
south	
of	
Baghdad	
.	

He	
did	V.01
comment	V.01
on	
what	
he	
meant	V.01
by	
the	
phrase	
.	
'	

And	
on	
April	
3	
his	
chief	
aide	
in	
Najaf	
was	V.03
suddenly	
arrested	V.01
along	
with	
13	
other	
members	
of	
his	
organization	
,	
and	
the	
Coalition	
forces	
are	V.03
put	V.01
into	
violent	
conflict	V.01
with	
his	
organization	
,	
which	
leaves	V.13
7	
US	
soldiers	
dead	
.	

The	
Army	
is	V.01
unlikely	V.01
to	
forgive	V.01
or	
forget	V.01
;	
but	
who	
provoked	V.01
it	
and	
why	
?	

I	
'm	V.01
not	
even	
in	
Iraq	
and	
I	
could	
have	V.01
predicted	V.01
to	
you	
the	
consequences	
of	
doing	V.02
what	
the	
CPA	
has	V.01
been	V.03
doing	V.02
.	

Anthony	
Shadid	
of	
the	
Washington	
Post	
reveals	V.01
that	
the	
warrants	
for	
the	
arrests	V.01
had	V.01
been	V.03
issued	V.01
months	
be	
for

Why	
were	V.03
they	
suddenly	
acted	V.02
on	
Saturday

look	V.02
like

All	
:	

It	
is	V.01
my	
understanding	V.01
,	
from	
good	
sources	
in	
the	
Gov	
s	
office	
that	
the	
Gov	
will	
order	V.01
Loretta	
Lynch	
to	
expeditiously	
implement	V.01
the	
provision	V.01
to	
suspend	V.01
all	
parties	
auhtority	
to	
enter	V.01
into	
direct	
access	V.01
contracts	
.	

The	
premise	
with	
which	
the	
administartion	
is	V.03
acting	V.02
is	V.01
that	
if	
they	
expeditiously	
suspend	V.01
everyone	
's	
right	V.05
to	
bilateral	
contracts	
quickly	
,	
it	
sets	V.03
up	
a	
barrier	
which	
the	
direct	
access	V.01
coalition	
must	
break	V.26
through	
.	

In	
other	
words	
the	
table	
is	V.03
set	V.14
.	

Deal	V.02
your	
meal	
from	
where	
the	
dishes	
are	V.03
located	V.01
.	

I.E.	
the	
Davis	
Administration	V.01
wants	V.01
to	
place	V.01
all	
direct	
access	
advocates	
in	
the	
position	
of	
having	V.02
to	
justify	V.01
why	
each	
and	
every	
party	
should	
be	V.01
the	
exception	V.01
to	
the	
suspension	V.01
rather	
than	
have	V.03
a	
general	
rule	V.01
concerning	
how	
direct	
access	V.01
should	
work	V.09
for	
all	
parties	
.	

It	
clearly	
gives	V.01
the	
Admin	
a	
very	
strong	
upper	
hand	
to	
control	V.01
who	
when	
and	
where	
direct	
access	V.01
can	
occur	V.01
without	
having	V.02
to	
say	V.01
that	
they	
oppose	V.01
direct	
access	V.01
.	

Power	
be	V.01
where	
power	
lies	V.07
.	

you	
are	V.03
n't	
going	V.02
in	
for	
the	
wedding	V.01
until	
sunday	
now	
?	

I	
'm	V.01
in

I	
spoke	V.01
to	
Bruce	
Garcey	
at	
NiMo	
regarding	
their	
RFP	
.	

Bruce	
indicated	V.01
NiMo	
short	
listed	V.01
five	
companies	
who	
all	
bid	V.01
higher	
than	
ENA	
.	

However	
,	
he	
also	
mentioned	V.01
we	
were	V.01
a	
close	
sixth	
,	
that	
is	V.01
close	V.10
to	
the	
fifth	
highest	
bid	V.01
.	

He	
gave	V.LV
no	
indication	V.01
on	
the	
value	
of	
the	
highest	
bid	V.01
.	

He	
also	
said	V.01
that	
the	
other	
five	
companies	
making	V.18
the	
short	
list	
all	
proposed	V.01
alternative	
structures	
to	
the	
proposed	
NiMo	
Tier	
Structure	
.	

NiMo	
released	V.01
an	
additional	
RFP	
for	
peaking	V.01
supplies	V.01
for	
this	
winter	
,	
I	
believe	V.01
Phil	
should	
have	V.03
or	
be	V.03
getting	V.01
that	
RFP	
.	

Phil	
if	
you	
could	
please	
make	V.LV

ASAP

On	
or	
about	
September	
23	
,	
1999	
a	
request	V.01
for	
service	V.01
was	V.03
placed	V.01
by	
the	
above	
referenced	V.04
counterparty	
.	

The	
request	V.01
was	V.01
for	
a	
Intrastate	
Gas	
Transportation	V.01
Agreement	V.01
and	
311	
Gas	
Transportation	V.01
Agreement	V.01
.	

These	
agreements	V.01
were	V.03
forwarded	V.01
to	
the	
counterparty	
,	
CCNG	
,	
Inc.	
.	

On	
or	
about	
October	
6	
,	
1999	
,	
Kelly	
Cloud	
,	
Senior	
Vice	
President	
of	
CCNG	
,	
Inc.	
(	
713	
)	
235-1972	
,	
called	V.02
and	
informed	V.01
me	
that	
the	
counterparty	
should	
be	V.01
CCGM	
,	
L.P.	
.	

Further	
,	
she	
informed	V.01
me	
that	
Section	
7	
of	
the	
agreement	V.01
,	
which	
reads	V.01
in	
part	
:	
Gas	
is	V.01
free	V.04
from	
liens	
and	
adverse	
claims	V.02
of	
every	
kind	
,	
should	
be	V.03
changed	V.01
because	
the	
gas	
that	
the	
counterparty	
will	
be	V.03
transporting	V.01
on	
HPL	
may	
and	
/	
or	
is	V.01
subject	
to	
liens	
.	

She	
was	V.03
instructed	V.01
to	
destroy	V.01
the	
agreement	V.01
and	
another	
would	
be	V.03
forwarded	V.01
to	
her	
with	
the	
necessary	
corrections	V.01
and	
re-wording	V.01
of	
Section	
7	
.	

Attached	V.01
find	V.01
the	
agreements	V.01
for	
the	
necessary	
changes	V.01
in	
Section	
7	
.	

Kelly	

Cloud	
has	V.01
instructed	V.01
me	
to	
call	V.02

What	
's	V.03
going	V.15
on	
dude	
?	

Antigua	
was	V.01
awesome	V.01
.	

I	
survived	V.01
it	
without	
a	
problem	
.	

Heather	
moving	V.01
in	
has	V.01
been	V.01
a	
different	
story	
.	

I	
did	V.01
n't	
realize	V.01
how	
much	
"	
stuff	
"	
you	
could	
pack	V.01
into	
a	
one	
bedroom	
apartment	
.	

How	
is	V.01
your	
love	
life	
.	

The	
gal	
from	
the	
wedding	V.01
was	V.01
pretty	
hot	V.03
.	

Are	V.03
you	
still	
chasing	V.01
that	
?	

Let	V.01
s	
get	V.14
together	
soon	
.	

Our	
extra	
bedroom	
is	V.01
nicer	V.01
now	
.	

My	
old	
bed	
got	V.03
tossed	V.01
in	
a	
dumpster	
.	

It	
smelled	V.02
like	
shit	
.	

Talk	V.01
to	
you	
later	

GT	

How	
is	V.03
it	
going	V.06
?	

Did	V.01
you	
survive	V.01
the	
honeymoon	V.01
?	

These	
look	V.02
fine	V.04
to	
me	
.	

Go	V.06
ahead	
and	
forward	V.01
to	
Brant	
if	
you	
are	V.01
ready	V.02

Glad	
to	
hear	V.01
all	
is	V.01
well	V.09
.	

I	
meant	V.02
to	
comment	V.01
that	
I	
thought	V.01
the	
people	
profiled	V.01
in	
the	
article	
should	
pull	V.01
their	
heads	
out	
of	
their	
self	
important	
asses	
.	

It	
is	V.01
n't	
about	
finding	V.01
the	
meaning	V.01
of	
life	
at	
work	V.01
.	

It	
is	V.01
all	
about	
the	
$$$	
.	

Work	V.01
hard	
.	

Make	V.05
$$$	
.	

Retire	V.01
young	V.01
.	

Things	
with	
me	
are	V.01
great	V.01
.	

Moving	
back	
to	
Calgary	
in	
about	
a	
month	
which	
is	V.01
a	
little	
sooner	
than	
I	
thought	V.01
I	
would	
be	V.03
going	V.02
back	
but	
when	
opportunity	
knocks	V.01
you	
got	V.06
ta	
go	V.02
.	

Take	V.LV
care	V.03
.	

I	
do	V.01
n't	
hear	V.01
from	
you	
in	
months	
and	
then	
you	
level	V.03
me	
with	
such	
a	
thought	
provoking	
,	
soul	
searching	
article	
.	

Thanks	V.01
for	
thinking	V.01
of	
me	
to	
send	V.01
it	
to	
.	

I	
really	
enjoyed	V.01
reading	V.01
it	
.	

We	
certainly	
fit	V.01
into	
certain	
parts	
of	
the	
article	
.	

There	
are	V.02
a	
few	
life	
theories	
like	
that	
which	
working	V.06
through	
.	

It	
s	V.01
all	
interesting	
stuff	
.	

How	
are	V.03
things	
going	V.06
with	
you	
?	

Are	V.03
you	
enjoying	V.01
Houston	
?	

London	
has	V.01
been	V.01
great	V.01
.	

Brokering	V.01
over	
here	
has	V.01
been	V.01
pretty	
rewarding	
.	

Traders	
over	
here	
seem	V.01
to	
have	V.LV
a	
lot	
more	
respect	V.01
for	
other	
humans	
.	

Catriona	
is	V.01
well	V.09
and	
has	V.01
landed	V.02
herself	
a	
pretty	
cool	
job	
in	
PR	
.	

Keep	V.02
in	
touch	V.01

I	
was	V.03
thinking	V.01
of	
converting	V.01
it	
to	
a	
hover	
vehicle	
.	

I	
might	
just	
sell	V.01
the	
car	
and	
get	V.04
you	
to	
drive	V.01
me	
around

You	
have	V.01
always	
been	V.01
on	
the	
move	V.01
seeking	V.01
affectionate	
,	
satisfying	
and	
harmonious	
relationships	V.03
.	

Your	
ultimate	
goal	
has	V.01
been	V.01
the	
realisation	V.02
of	
an	
intimate	
union	V.02
in	
which	
there	
could	
be	V.02
love	V.01
,	
self	
-	
sacrifice	V.01
and	
mutual	
trust	
.	

It	
has	V.01
often	
been	V.03
said	V.01
that	
"	
True	
love	V.01
is	V.01
just	
around	
the	
corner	
"	
...	
and	
maybe	
...	
if	
you	
have	V.01
n't	
found	V.01
it	
as	
yet	
-	
you	
possibly	
soon	
will	
.	

In	
the	
past	
there	
have	V.01
been	V.02
..	
and	
maybe	
there	
still	
are	V.02
many	
things	
that	
you	
have	V.01
had	V.02
to	
do	V.02
without	
.	

You	
have	V.01
now	
decided	V.01
to	
set	V.01
your	
sights	V.01
on	
a	
position	
or	
situation	
that	
could	
give	V.01
you	
greater	
prestige	
and	
which	
will	
afford	V.02
you	
considerable	
self	
esteem	
.	

You	
wear	V.01
your	
heart	
on	
your	
sleeve	
...	
and	
since	
you	
are	V.01
an	
emotional	
person	
you	
are	V.01
apt	V.01
to	
give	V.01
your	
all	
...	
heart	
and	
soul	
...	
to	
all	
those	
that	
show	V.01
you	
a	
little	
affection	V.01
...	
but	
take	V.LV
care	V.03
...	
it	
would	
appear	V.02
that	
you	
have	V.01
been	V.03
extremely	
hurt	V.01
in	
the	
past	
...	
and	
you	
keep	V.02
leaving	V.12
yourself	
wide	
open	V.08
for	
punishment	V.01
..	

Whatever	
you	
strive	V.01
to	
do	V.02
,	
something	
always	
seems	V.01
to	
be	V.03
holding	V.07
you	
back	
.	

There	
is	V.02
no	
subterfuge	
in	
you	
.	

You	
are	V.01
a	
clear	
thinker	
and	
all	
you	
demand	V.01
from	
life	
,	
in	
a	
relationship	V.03
,	
is	V.01
a	
partner	
whom	
you	
can	
trust	V.02
and	
with	
whom	
you	
can	
,	
together	
,	
develop	V.02
a	
foundation	
of	
trust	
based	
on	
understanding	V.01
.	

You	
are	V.01
your	
own	
person	
...	
and	
you	
demand	V.01
freedom	
of	
thought	V.01
...	
to	
follow	V.02
your	
own	
convictions	V.02
.	

You	
have	V.LV
no	
interest	V.01
in	
"	
two	
-	
timing	V.01
"	
and	
all	
you	
seek	V.01
is	V.01
sincerity	
and	
"	
straight	
-	
dealing	V.01
"	
.	

You	
wish	V.01
to	
be	V.03
left	V.14
in	
peace	V.01
...	
no	
more	
conflict	V.01
and	
no	
more	
differences	V.02
of	
opinion	
...	

In	
fact	
you	
just	
do	V.01

be	V.01
involved	V.01

any

All

Dear	
All	
,	

My	
mane	
is	V.01
Visit	
Phunnarungsi	
.	

I	
used	V.03
to	
e-mail	V.01
Vince	
Kaminski	
about	
the	
advice	
on	
his	
article	
"	
The	
Challenge	
of	
Pricing	V.01
and	
Risk	
Managing	V.01
Electricity	
Derivatives	
"	
and	
he	
had	V.01
mailed	V.01
me	
the	
copy	V.01
.	

I	
am	V.03
now	
modelling	V.01
the	
Queensland	
electricity	
spot	
price	V.01
using	V.01
Geometric	
Brownian	
Mean	
Reverting	V.01
Jump	
Diffusion	V.01
Model	V.01
and	
have	V.01
followed	V.02
your	
paper	
"	
Making	V.01
the	
most	
of	
mean	
reversion	
"	
to	
estimate	V.01
the	
mean	
reversion	V.01
speed	
.	

I	
use	V.01
Queensland	
half	
-	
hourly	
price	V.01
during	
13	
December	
,	
1998	
-	
30	
June	
2001	
giving	V.01
about	
44,000	
price	
observations	V.02
.	

However	
,	
the	
result	
from	
Ordinary	
Least	
Squares	
was	V.01
not	
as	
expected	V.01
due	
to	
different	
sign	V.07
for	
both	
slope	
&	
intercept	
.	

The	
coefficient	
and	
standard	
error	V.01
are	V.01
as	
followed	V.04
:	

Intercept	
:	
-	
0.3931	
(	
0.0076	
)	

Slope	
:	
0.1171	
(	
0.0022	
)	

R	
Square	
:	
0.0585	

Therefore	
I	
could	
not	
estimate	V.01
the	
mean	
reversion	V.01
rate	
as	
the	
estimated	
slope	
has	V.03
the	
positive	
sign	V.07
.	

I	
have	V.01
also	
tried	V.01
monthly	
data	
and	
the	
results	
are	V.01
the	
same	
.	

It	
would	
be	V.03
appreciated	V.02
if	
you	
could	
advice	V.01
me	
on	
this	
matter

Thanks	V.01

the

a

your

Right	
now

we	
are	V.01
in	
the	
process	V.02
of	
evaluating	V.01
both	
our	
new	
hire	
needs	V.01
and	
our	
summer	
needs	V.01
and	
will	
be	V.03
making	V.LV
those	
decisions	V.01
after	
the	
first	
of	
the	
year	
.	

Until	
we	
have	V.01
come	V.11
up	
with	
those	
numbers	
it	
would	
be	V.01
premature	V.01
to	
make	V.LV
any	
offers	V.01
for	
the	
summer	
.	

What	
I	
would	
like	V.02
to	
do	V.02
in	
this	
case	
is	V.01
get	V.01
the	
information	
to	
Jeff	
Davis	
,	
who	
is	V.01
responsible	V.03
for	
Georgia	
Tech	
and	
ask	V.02
him	
to	
get	V.01
Sungjoo	
's	
resume	
and	
start	V.01
a	
file	
on	
him	
with	
a	
notation	V.01
that	
you	
would	
like	V.02
to	
hire	V.01
him	
for	
summer	
.	

When	
we	
start	V.01
the	
summer	
process	V.02
,	
we	
will	
interview	V.01
the	
candidate	
and	
slot	
him	
for	
your	
group	
.	

Is	V.01
this	
okay	
with	
you	
?	

Hope	V.01
all	
is	V.01
well	V.09
with	
you	

Take	V.LV

I	
hope	V.01
you	
have	V.LV
a	
good	
flight	V.01

its	
finance	
sector

Thank	V.01
you	
for	
your	
time

I	
have	V.01
already	
submitted	V.01
my	
resume	
and	
cover	
letter	
right	
after	
the	
talk	V.01
.	

However	
,	
you	
ask	V.02
me	
to	
send	V.01
a	
copy	V.01
of	
resume	
and	
cover	
letter	
again	
.	

Those	
attachments	V.01
are	V.01
what	
I	
was	V.03
asked	V.02
.	

Again	
,	
it	
was	V.01
a	
good	
chance	V.02
for	
me	
to	
get	V.22
to	
know	V.01
what	
I	
can	
do	V.02
in	
this	
field	
and	
what	
I	
have	V.02
to	
more	
focus	V.01
on	
in	
school	
.	

I	
am	V.03
looking	V.03
forward	
to	
hearing	V.01
from	
you	
soon	
and	
have	V.03
a	
nice	
day

with	
you	
,	
myself	
,	
and	
Larry	
to	
go	V.06
over	
the	
payment	
methodology	
.	

Please	
let	V.01
me	
know	V.01
a	
date	
and	
time	
that	
is	V.01
convenient	V.01
for

Thanks	V.01

Renee	

Renee	
,	

Thank	V.01
you	
for	
digging	V.01
in	
to	
the	
issue	V.02
of	
Deferred	V.01
Phantom	
Stock	
Units	
.	

It	
is	V.01
clear	V.06
that	
the	
payment	V.01
will	
be	V.03
made	V.LV
in	
shares	V.01
.	

However	
,	
I	
still	
do	V.01
n't	
understand	V.01
which	
date	
will	
be	V.03
used	V.01
to	
determine	V.01
the	
value	
and	
calculate	V.01
how	
many	
shares	V.01
.	

The	
plan	
document	
under	
VII	
.	

Amount	
of	
Benefit	
Payments	
reads	V.01
"	
The	
value	
of	
the	
shares	V.01
,	
and	
resulting	V.01
payment	
amount	
will	
be	V.03
based	V.02
on	
the	
closing	
price	V.01
of	
Enron	
Corp.	
common	
stock	
on	
the	
January	
1	
before	
the	
date	
of	
payment	V.01
,	
and	
such	
payment	V.01
shall	
be	V.03
made	V.LV
in	
shares	V.01
of	
Enron	
Corp.	
common	
stock	
.	
"	

Can	
you	
help	V.01
me	
interpret	V.01
this	
statement	V.01
and	
work	V.06
through	
the	
numbers	
on	
my	
account	
.	

Thank	V.01
you	
,

Let	V.01
me	
know	V.01
when	
you	
get	V.01
the	
quotes	V.01
from	
Pauline	
.	

I	
am	V.03
expecting	V.01
to	
pay	V.01
something	
in	
the	
$	
3,	
to	
$	
5,000	
range	
.	

I	
would	
like	V.02
to	
see	V.01
the	
quotes	V.01
and	
a	
description	V.01
of	
the	
work	V.01
to	
be	V.03
done	V.02
.	

It	
is	V.01
my	
understanding	V.01
that	
some	
rock	
will	
be	V.03
removed	V.01
and	
replaced	V.01
with	
siding	
.	

If	
they	
are	V.03
getting	V.01
quotes	V.01
to	
put	V.01
up	
new	
rock	
then	
we	
will	
need	V.01
to	
clarify	V.10
.	

Jacques	
is	V.01
ready	V.02
to	
drop	V.07
in	
a	
dollar	
amount	
on	
the	
release	V.01
.	

If	
the	
negotiations	V.01
stall	V.01
,	
it	
seems	V.01
like	
I	
need	V.01
to	
go	V.06
ahead	
and	
cut	V.04
off	
the	
utilities	
.	

Hopefully	
things	
will	
go	V.06
smoothly	
.

The

Currently	
,	
Mercury

conjunct	
and	
the	
conjunction	
is	V.03
being	V.03
closely	
aspected	V.01
by	
Rahu

In	
Pakistan	
national	
chart	
besides	
the	
transit	
affliction	V.01
to	
transit	
Venus	
in	
the	
fourth	
house	
by	
FMs	
Rahu	
and	
Mercury	
,	
natal	
Saturn	
and	
Venus	
are	V.01
also	
under	
the	
close	
affliction	V.01
of	
transit	
Rahu	
.	

This	
has	V.01
resulted	V.01
in	
a	
major	
rail	
accident	
in	
Pakistan	
involving	V.01
three	
trains	
and	
involving	V.01
more

under	
the

which	
has	V.01
resulted	V.01
into

Heh	
,	
yep	
,	
I	
like	V.02
to	
wear	V.01
silk	
chemises	
,	
panties	
even	
stockings	
with	
garter	
belt	
.	

I	
feel	V.01
great	V.01
in	
it	
.	

First	
time	
I	
started	V.01
wearing	V.01
woman	
's	
lingerie	
I	
was	V.01
very	
young	V.01
.	

I	
did	V.01
n't	
fought	V.01
is	V.01
it	
good	V.02
or	
not	
than	
.	

Later	
on	
I	
red	V.01
somewhere	
that	
it	
's	V.01
seakness	
.	

I	
was	V.01
ashamed	
to	
be	V.01
in	
friendship	
with	
girls	
...	
until	
I	
undrstood	V.01
that	
it	
's	V.01
not	
seakness	
as	
well	
as	
women	
wearing	V.01
men	
's	
pants	
is	V.01
n't	
seak	
:)	

Now	
I	
have	V.03
wife	
and	
son	
.	

My	
wife	
know	V.01
my	
harmless	
secret	
and	
supports	V.01
me	
.	

So	
,	
I	
'm	V.01
Men	
and	
love	V.02
to	
wear	V.01
women	
's	
lingerie

when	
I

night	
the	
first	
thing	
I	
do	V.02
is	V.01
change	V.01

love	V.01

Frequent	
travelers	
and	
executives	
are	V.01
among	
the	
masses	
that	
get	V.01
a	
lot	
of	
discount	V.01
in	
the	
airfare	
.	

It	
is	V.01
easy	V.05
to	
get	V.01
discount	
airfare	
for	
them	
since	
they	
travel	V.01
very	
frequently	
.	

Cheap	
air	
tickets	
for	
Corporate	

Some	
of	
the	
corporate	
also	
get	V.01
cheap	
air	
tickets	
because	
they	
tie	V.05
up	
with	
some	
of	
the	
airlines	
for	
a	
certain	
period	
based	
on	
the	
discount	V.01
and	
services	V.01
they	
get	V.01
from	
the	
airlines	
.	

Corporate	
plans	V.01
are	V.03
clubbed	V.01
with	
other	
services	V.01
through	
some	
agencies	
to	
provide	V.01
better	
service	V.01
for	
their	
staff	
.	

Promotional	
discount	
airfare	

Some	
countries	
like	
Malaysia	
and	
Singapore	
promote	V.02
trading	V.01
for	
foreign	
visitors	
during	
some	
part	
of	
the	
year	
.	

During	
this	
period	
,	
they	
offer	V.01
cheap	
air	
tickets	
to	
their	
country	
on	
certain	
flights	V.01

Several	
years	
ago	
I	
developed	V.02
a	
short	
paper	
and	
pencil	
screening	
test	V.01
which	
,	
in	
a	
small	
pilot	
study	V.01
,	
discriminated	V.01
between	
ADHD	
,	
LD	
,	
and	
control	
subjects	
.	

I	
recently	
converted	V.01
this	
test	V.01
to	
an	
online	
test	V.01
in	
order	
to	
norm	V.01
it	
to	
a	
larger	
population	V.01
and	
,	
subsequently	
,	
to	
make	V.02
it	
available	V.02
to	
any	
one	
who	
has	V.03
access	V.01
to	
a	
computer	
and	
the	
Internet	
.	

The	
test	V.01
itself	
is	V.01
what	
is	V.03
called	V.01
a	
substitution	
test	V.01
.	

It	
has	V.03
two	
parts	
,	
both	
of	
which	
are	V.03
timed	V.01
for	
90	
seconds	
each	
and	
the	
differential	
between	
the	
resulting	V.01
two	
scores	V.01
determines	V.01
the	
likelihood	
of	
having	V.03
a	
learning	
disability	
or	
attention	
deficit	
disorder	
.	

I	
am	V.01
in	
need	V.01
of	
test	
subjects	
and	
hope	V.01
you	
will	
take	V.01
it	
.	

The	
test	V.01
,	
along	
with	
an	
information	
form	
,	
is	V.01
available	V.02
at	
:	
.	

I	
think	V.01
a	
test	V.01
like	
this	
one	
is	V.03
much	
needed	V.01
.	

A	
person	
can	
take	V.01
it	
directly	
instead	
of	
others	
completing	V.01
behavioral	
checklists	
or	
a	
completing	V.01
a	
lengthy	
program	
intensive	
test	V.01
like	
TOVA	
.	

Perhaps	
you	
are	V.01
willing	V.02
to	
recommend	V.01
this	
site	
and	
,	
if	
you	
have	V.03
a	
website	
,	
place	V.01
a	
link	
on	
your	
website	
.	

are	V.02
there	
any	
sadists	
out	
there	
who	
share	V.01
the	
same	
tastes	V.01
as	
i	
do	V.01
?	

i	
do	V.01
nt	
know	V.01
what	
it	
is	V.01
,	
but	
since	
a	
very	
young	
age	
i	
have	V.01
had	V.LV
a	
strange	
but	
very	
gratifying	
urge	V.01
to	
torture	V.01
or	
maime	V.01
animals	
.	

i	
am	V.01
deadly	
serious	V.01
,	
i	
really	
do	V.01
get	V.01
sexual	
releif	
from	
even	
hearing	V.01
of	
torture	V.01
of	
animals	
,	
now	
some	
people	
may	
call	V.01
me	
a	
brute	
or	
a	
coward	
but	
i	
ca	
nt	
help	V.02
my	
true	
feelings	V.01
.	

badger	
baiting	V.02
is	V.01
natrually	
a	
huge	
turn	V.13
on	
,	
so	
i	
thought	V.01
a	
few	
words	
in	
this	
group	
might	
uncover	V.01
some	
mutual	
enthusiasts	
.	

sincere	
appologies	
to	
anyone	
who	
is	V.03
offended	V.01
by	
my	
request	V.01
but	
my	
request	V.01
is	V.01
genuine	V.01

Once	
upon	
a	
time	
(	
in	
2001	
,	
to	
be	V.01
specific	
)	
,	
the	
Coca	
-	
Cola	
corporation	
built	V.01
a	
bottling	
plant	
in	
a	
small	
and	
remote	
Indian	
village	
in	
the	
state	
of	
Kerala	
.	

In	
exchange	V.01
for	
sucking	V.01
vast	
amounts	
of	
water	
out	
of	
the	
local	
land	
,	
the	
mighty	
corporation	
promised	V.01
to	
bring	V.01
the	
people	
great	
wealth	
.	

But	
within	
a	
few	
short	
months	
,	
the	
village	
people	
began	V.02
to	
notice	V.01
their	
wells	
were	V.03
running	V.01
dry	
,	
so	
they	
complained	V.01
to	
the	
corporation	
.	

Coca	
-	
Cola	
calmed	V.01
the	
concerns	V.01
of	
the	
people	
and	
attempted	V.01
to	
win	V.01
back	
their	
favor	
by	
giving	V.01
them	
vast	
amounts	
of	
free	
fertilizer	
,	
saying	V.01
it	
would	
grow	V.03
bountiful	
crops	
beyond	
their	
wildest	
dreams	V.01
.	

After	
several	
years	
of	
use	V.01
,	
we	
arrive	V.01
at	
the	
present	
day	
when	
the	
village	
people	
have	V.01
suddenly	
discovered	V.01
the	
fertilizer	
is	V.01
actually	
the	
bottling	
plant	
's	
waste	
sludge	
and	
is	V.01
laden	
with	
cadmium	
,	
a	
highly	
toxic	
,	
cancer	
-	
causing	
heavy	
metal	
.	

The	
village	
soil	
and	
water	
are	V.03
now	
too	
heavily	
contaminated	V.01
to	
safely	
occupy	V.01
human	
life	
,	
so	
the	
plant	
was	V.03
shut	V.05
down	
last	
week	
.	

Moral	
of	
the	
story	
:	
Do	V.01
n't	
drink	V.01
Coke	
..........	
drink	V.01
Pepsi	
!	

Just	
kidding	V.01
,	
Pepsi	
is	V.01
actually	
in	
the	
process	V.02
of	
being	V.03
thrown	V.01
out	
of	
India	
for	
similar	
crimes	
,	
as	
well	
.	

The	
Greater	
New	
Orleans	
Fair	
Housing	
Action	
Center	
(	
GNOFHAC	
)	
filed	V.01
a	
housing	
discrimination	V.02
complaint	V.01
against	
the	
Housing	
Authority	
of	
New	
Orleans	
(	
HANO	
)	
last	
week	
.	

The	
complaint	V.01
,	
filed	V.01
with	
the	
United	
States	
Department	
of	
Housing	
and	
Urban	
Development	
,	
accuses	V.01
HANO	
of	
violating	V.01
a	
2003	
enforcement	
agreement	V.01
entered	V.01
into	
between

one	
of

hoping	V.01

launch	V.01

NASA	
intends	V.01
upon	
retiring	V.02
the

in	
2010	
,	
which	
only	
leaves	V.13
it	
with	
18

Outsourcing	V.01

the

NASA	
seems	V.01
hesitant	V.01

(

On

,	
NASA	
administrator	
Michael

told	V.01
the

house

committee	
that	
the

expects	V.01

invest	V.01
about	
$	
500

in	
the	
commercial	
cargo

project	
over

years	
.	

"	
That	
kind	
of	
a

incentive	
[

]	
will	
be	V.01
sufficient	
to	
allow	V.01
substantial	
providers	
to	
emerge	V.01
,	
"	
Griffin	
said	V.01
.	

"	
I	
hope	V.01
that	
industry

if	
put	V.03
to	
the

can

I

added	V.01

Only

reveal	V.01
whether	
Griffin	
's	
expectations	V.01
are	V.03
either	
exceeded	V.01

successfully	
transport	V.01
civilians	
to	
the

(	
at	
about	
a	
fifth

it	
would	
come	V.04

no

Palestinian

,

Cloaking	V.01
himself	
in	
Yasser	
Arafat	
's	
legacy	
,	
Abbas	
pledged	V.01
to	
fulfill	V.01
Palestinian	
dreams	V.01
of	
statehood	
.	

It	
seems	V.01
that	
the	
Palestinian	
leadership	V.02
(	
upcoming	
)	
will	
not	
be	V.01
a	
peace	
partner	
with	
Israel	
.	

He	
is	V.03
already	
demanding	V.01
claims	V.01
that	
Israel	
said	V.01
no	
to	
not	
only	
the	
world	
,	
but	
to	
Arafat	
himself	
.	

Listing	V.01
his	
priorities	
,	
Abbas	
told	V.01
supporters	
of	
the	
ruling	
Fatah	
party	
that	
he	
was	V.01
determined	V.02
to	
provide	V.01
security	
to	
his	
people	
and	
continue	V.01
the	
struggle	V.01
against	
Israel	
's	
partially	
completed	
West	
Bank	
barrier	
.	

Abbas	
also	
pledged	V.01
to	
resolve	V.01
the	
problem	
of	
millions	
of	
Palestinian	
refugees	
and	
their	
descendants	
.	

Abbas	
,	
a	
refugee	
himself	
from	
what	
is	V.01
today	
the	
northern	
Israeli	
city	
of	
Safed	
,	
called	V.01
the	
refugee	
issue	V.02
"	
very	
important	V.01
and	
very	
dangerous	V.01
.	
"	

Having	V.01
personally	
visited	V.01
the	
West	
Bank	
and	
Israel	
,	
I	
can	
say	V.01
that	
this	
new	
political	
voice	V.01
is	V.03
threatening	V.01
to	
collapse	V.01
the	
peace	
process	V.02
.	

If	
Abbas	
does	V.01
not	
change	V.01
his	
former	
thinking	V.01
and	
continues	V.01
the	
path	
of	
Yasser	
Arafat	
,	
then	
there	
will	
not	
be	V.02
peace	V.01
in	
the	
Holy	
Land	
and	
the	
Palestinians	
will	
ultimately	
suffer	V.01

Quarters

(	
BBC	
)	

The	
Palestinian	
militant	
organisation	
Hamas	
has	V.01
announced	V.01
an	
end	V.01
to	
rocket	
attacks	V.01
on	
Israel	
from	
the	
Gaza	
Strip	
after	
a	
weekend	
of	
escalating	
violence	
.	

Up	
to	
40	
rockets	
had	V.01
been	V.03
fired	V.01
at	
Israel	
,	
weeks	
after	
its	
military	
withdrew	V.01
from	
the	
territory	
.	

In	
response	V.01
to	
the	
rockets	
,	
Israel	
resumed	V.01
its	
policy	
of	
targeting	V.01
militant	
leaders	
in	
air	
strikes	V.01
.	

Authorised	V.01
by	
Ariel	
Sharon	
to	
make	V.LV
"	
unrestricted	
"	
strikes	V.01
,	
its	
military	
launched	V.01
new	
missile	
attacks	V.01
overnight	
.	

It	
looks	V.02
as	
if	
Hamas	
has	V.01
thrown	V.01
in	
the	
towel	
for	
this	
round	V.05
,	
unable	V.01
to	
take	V.LV
the	
beating	V.01
the	
Israeli	
Defense	
Forces	
have	V.01
unleashed	V.01
upon	
this	
terrorist	
group	
.	

Mahmoud	
Zahar	
,	
Hamas	
's	
leader	
declared	V.01
the	
cease	
fire	V.01
after	
Israel	
killed	V.01
it's	
former	
leader	
,	
Muhammed	
Sheikh	
Khalil	
.	

Hamas	
has	V.01
become	V.01
rather	
unpopular	
in	
Gaza	
,	
as	
many	
see	V.01
the	
Israeli	
air	
strikes	V.01
as	
a	
response	V.01
towards	
the	
rocket	
attacks	V.01
upon	
Israeli	
soil	
.	

Egypt	
had	V.03
a	
role	
to	
play	V.02
as	
they	
convinced	V.01
Hamas	
to	
end	V.01
the	
attacks	V.01
,	
although	
the	
same	
can	
not	
be	V.03
said	V.01
of	
Islamic	
Jihad	
.	

(	
Jerusalem	
Post	
)	

"	
We	
're	V.01
not	
happy	V.01
with

's	
position

this	
stage	
and	
in	
light

the	
Israeli	
escalation	V.01
against	
the	
Palestinians	
,	
"	
commented	V.01
Khader	
Habib	
,	
a	
senior	
Islamic	
Jihad	
official	
.	

"	
But	
it	
seems	V.01
that	
Hamas	
has	V.03
its	
own	
political	
agenda	
.	
"	

[	
...	
]	

"	
The	
problem	
is	V.01
not	
with	
the	
Palestinian	
resistance	
groups	
but	
with	
Israel	
's	
scheme	
to	
destroy	V.01
the	
Palestinians	
'	
infrastructure	
,	
"	
Habib	
said	V.01
.	

"	
Hamas	
remains	V.01
targeted	V.01
by	
Israel	
,	
as	
in	
the	
past	
,	
and	
the	
Israeli	
occupation	V.01
does	V.01
not	
need	V.01
excuses	V.02
to	
pursue	V.01
its	
aggression	V.01
.	

Israel	
wants	V.01
to	
drive	V.02
the	
Palestinians	
toward	
civil	
war	V.01
.	
"	

Islamic	
Jihad	
has	V.01
refused	V.01
to	
recognized	V.02
the	
cease	
fire	V.01
,	
and	
hopes	V.01
to	
turn	V.02
the	
Gaza	
strip	
"	
into	
a	
vast	
battlefield	
.	
"	

Unless	
President	
Mahmoud	
Abbas	
steps	V.02
in	
,	
Gaza	
will	
probably	
look	V.02
like	
a	
battle	
field	
by	
the	
time	
Israel	
is	V.01
done	V.08
reminding	V.01
Hamas	
of	
their	
critical	
error	V.01
,	
although	
currently	
the	
only	
thing	
Abbas	
is	V.03
doing	V.02
is	V.01
lashing	V.02
out	
and	
refusing	V.01
to	
take	V.01
responsibility	
for	
his	
inability	
to	
act	V.02

Help	V.01

a

It	
's	V.01
my	
two	
year	
anniversary	V.01
in	
a	
few	
days	
and	
was	V.03
wondering	V.01
if	
somone	
could	
tell	V.01
me	
about	
a	
great	
restaurant	
in	
sf	
or	
other	
nearby

I	
like	V.01
Hayes

,	
it	
's	V.01
right

you	
can

happen	V.01
if	
you	
flew	V.01
the

Vietnam

It	
would	
be	V.01
similar	V.01
to	
flying	V.01
the	
flag	
of	
the	
Third	
Reich	
in	
modern	
day	
Germany	
or	
in	
Israel	
.	

You	
would	
be	V.03
violating	V.01
the	
law

The	
police	
would	
make	V.02
you	
take	V.22
it	
down	
and	
you	
may	
face	V.01
fines	
and	
imprisonment	
(	
but	
definitely	
not	
execution	V.01
.	
)	

You	
will	
also	
face	V.01
the	
ire	
of	
most	
people	
there

They	
might	
be	V.03
imprisoned	V.01

Yes

it	
would	
be	V.01
an

they

a

to	
tell	V.02

Cockatiels	
can	
lay	V.01
unfertilized	
eggs	
as	
well

Just	
because	
you	
have	V.03
a

it	
can	
not	
be	V.03
guaranteed	V.01

You	
can

picking	V.04
up	
the	
eggs	
and	
holding	V.01
it	
up

bright	
light

If	
you	
see	V.01
a	
dark	
spot	
in	
the	
egg	
,	
that	
means	V.01
it	
is	V.01

will

flight	V.01

where	
can	
I	
get	V.01
morcillas	
in	
tampa	
bay	
,	
I	
will	
like	V.01
the	
argentinian	
type	
,	
but	
I	
will	
to	
try	V.01
anothers	
please	
?	

I	
searched	V.01
all	
over

one	
place	
in

morcillas	
,	
also	
known	V.01
as

black	
pudding	
and	
blood

learned	V.01
that	
morcillas	
are	V.01
basically	
impossible	V.01
to	
find	V.01
all	
across	
the	
North	
American

,	
where	
they	
sell	V.01
all	
types	
of	
sausages

blood	
sausages

buy	V.01
some	
blood	
sausages	
.

n't	
know	V.01

Alike

both

fought	V.01
for

by	
the

(	
no

what	
the

What	
is	V.01
your	
cat	
s	
name	
and	
why	
did	V.01
you	
name	V.01
him	
/	
her	
that	
?	

If	
you	
HAVE	V.03
a	
cat	
of	
course	
.	

My	
cat	
s	
name	
is	V.01
Twinky	
.	

When	
she	
was	V.01
a	
tiny	
little	
kitten	
she	
looked	V.02
like	
those	
twinky	
snack	
cakes	
.	

She	
is	V.01
a	
creme	
tabby	
and	
I	
've	V.01
had	V.03
her	
for	
over	
2	
years	
now	
.	

I	
have	V.01
a	
siamese	
lynx	
name	V.01
Star	
we	
called	V.01
her	
that	
because	
she	
has	V.03
a	
star	
pattern	
on	
her	
face	
.	

And	
she	
is	V.01
the	
STAR	
of	
the	
family	
.	

I	
love	V.01
her	
.	
:)	

I	
have	V.03
a	
Norwegian	
Forest	
Cat	
that	
is	V.03
named	V.01
Achilles	
bc	
as	
a	
kitten	
he	
always	
attacked	V.01
your	
feet	
when	
you	
walked	V.01
by	
!	

My	
cat	
s	V.03
Called	V.01
Frank	
because	
the	
year	
we	
got	V.01
him	
was	V.01
the	
year	
Frank	
Sinatra	
died	V.01

He	
also	
had	V.03
bright	
blue	
eyes	
like	
Frank	
Sinatra	
did	V.02
:)	

what	
does	V.01
it	
mean	V.01
when	
a	
veiled	
chameleon	
egg	
is	V.01
soft	V.02
?	

my	
female	
chameleon	
just	
laid	V.01
eggs	
yesterday	
and	
today	
some	
of	
the	
eggs	
are	V.01
soft	V.02
when	
i	
mean	V.01
soft	
i	
mean	V.01
like	
not	
like	
ordinary	
chameleon	
eggs	
.	

They	
are	V.01
probably	
infertile	
.	

If	
there	
is	V.02
no	
male	
they	
are	V.01
probably	
infertile	
!	

If	
you	
take	V.01
a	
flash	
light	
and	
shine	V.01
it	
through	
the	
eggs	
and	
you	
see	V.01
nothing	
throw	V.07
them	
away	
!	

If	
you	
do	V.01
not	
they	
will	
start	V.01
to	
rot	V.01
!	

If	
she	
has	V.03
no	
male	
to	
fertilize	V.01
the	
eggs	
,	
the	
eggs	
will	
aways	
be	V.01
infertile	
.	

if	
you	
do	V.01
have	V.03
a	
male	
but	
they	
are	V.01
not	
in	
the	
same	
cage	
or	
breeding	V.01
but	
you	
touch	V.01
him	
then	
her	
she	
will	
smell	V.01
his	
sent	
and	
probably	
lay	V.01
eggs	
.	

Hope	V.01
she	
stops	V.01
laying	V.01
eggs	
because	
she	
will	
get	V.03
really	
skinny	
!	

If	
she	
continues	V.01
!	

Hope	V.01
this	
helps	V.01

Take	V.LV
a	
ferry	
ride	V.01
!!!	

It	
's	V.01
an	
amazing	
experience	V.01
!	

Is	V.01
it	
better	V.02
to	
book	V.03
a	
cruise	
online	
or	
by	
a	
travel	
agent	
?	

First	
time	
to	
go	V.02
on	
A	
cruise	
any	
and	
all	
info	
is	V.03
appreciated	V.02

Personally	
,	
I	
do	V.01
n't	
find	V.02
a	
travel	
agent	
to	
be	V.01
of	
value	
to	
me	
as	
I	
am	V.01
willing	V.02
to	
put	V.05
in	
the	
time	
doing	V.LV
research	V.01
on	
the	
internet	
.	

I	
have	V.01
not	
had	V.LV
good	
experience	V.01
with	
travel	
agents	
.	

They	
do	V.01
n't	
seem	V.01
to	
know	V.01
anything	
but	
the	
hype	
they	
are	V.03
told	V.01
and	
the	
packages	
they	
have	V.03
available	V.02
to	
them	
.	

The	
one	
time	
I	
actually	
booked	V.03
through	
a	
travel	
agent	
I	
did	V.01
not	
get	V.01
all	
of	
the	
amenities	
I	
had	V.01
paid	V.01
for	
.	

The	
few	
times	
I	
have	V.01
consulted	V.01
with	
a	
travel	
agent	
I	
was	V.01
able	V.01
to	
find	V.01
the	
same	
for	
less	
on	
my	
own	
,	
and	
more	
options	
than	
what	
they	
were	V.03
selling	V.01
.	

So	
now	
I	
do	V.01
not	
bother	V.02
with	
them	
at	
all	
.	

best	
is	V.01
using	V.01

have	V.03
a	
dog	
and	
my	
mother	
is	V.01
really	
really	
terrified	V.01
of	
hamsters	
.	

Well	
last	
night	
while	
I	
was	V.03
sleeping	V.01
,	
my	
hamster	
escaped	V.01
from	
his	
cage	
.	

He	
is	V.01
in	
my	
room	
,	
but	
there	
are	V.02
so	
many	
things	
inside	
there	
,	
I	
du	V.01
n	
no	V.01
what	
to	
do	V.02
.	

I	
have	V.03
lots	
of	
containers	
in	
there	
.	

Anybody	
give	V.01
me	
ideas	
like	
a	
trap	
or	
something	
?	

Find	V.01
him	
before	
he	
finds	V.01
the	
dog	
food	
.	

I	
'm	V.03
not	
kidding	V.01
,	
I	
once	
lost	V.02
a	
hamster	
in	
my	
house	
3	
months	
later	
I	
walk	V.01
down	
in	
the	
basement	
and	
it	
was	V.01
as	
big	V.01
as	
a	
rat	
.	

It	
had	V.01
been	V.03
eating	V.01
dog	
food	
the	
whole	
time	
.	

It	
was	V.01
huge	V.01
and	
scared	V.01
the	
crap	
out	
of	
me	
.	

Make	V.02
sure	V.01
he	
is	V.01
n't	
trapped	V.01
somewhere	
&	
put	V.01
a	
bowl	
of	
food	
out	
.	

He	
will	
come	V.01
and	
eat	V.01

Start	V.01
cleaning	V.01
and	
start	V.01
looking	V.01
.	

can	
i	
have	V.03
some	
indoor	
pet	
ideas	
please	
!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	

i	
want	V.01
a	
small	
indoor	
pet	
that	
my	
mother	
will	
let	V.01
me	
have	V.03
please	
help	V.01

i	
want	V.01
something	
cheap	
east	
to	
take	V.LV
care	V.03
of	
and	
something	
to	
hopefully	
fit	V.01
in	
my	
room	

no	
pet	
is	V.01
really	
easy	V.05
to	
take	V.LV
care	V.03
of	
.	

they	
all	
need	V.01
love	V.01
and	
attn	
,	
food	
,	
proper	
surroundings	
etc	
.	

the	
easiest	
thing	
would	
be	V.01
a	
fish	
-	
but	
u	
need	V.01
to	
clean	V.01
the	
tank	
weekly	
,	
feed	V.01
it	
the	
right	
amt	
,	
etc	
etc	
x	

Having	V.03
a	
pet	
is	V.01
n't	
easy	V.05
.	

You	
should	
treat	V.01
all	
pets	
like	
children	
.	

They	
require	V.01
a	
lot	
of	
attention	V.02
or	
they	
get	V.03
fussy	
and	
tear	V.04
stuff	
up	
.	

If	
you	
want	V.01
easy	
then	
go	V.03
with	
a	
gold	
fish	
or	
hamster	
.	

I	
would	
go	V.03
with	
a	
small	
rodent	
such	
as	
a	
mouse	
,	
rat	
,	
hamster	
or	
gerbil	
if	
you	
want	V.01
something	
you	
can	
handle	V.01
and	
hold	V.01
.	

Fish	
are	V.01
probably	
the	
easiest	
to	
take	V.LV
care	V.03
of	
though

french	
male	
sensuality	
?	

I	
ve	V.01
been	V.03
dating	V.02
a	
man	
from	
brittany	
france	
for	
a	
couple	
of	
months	
now	
.	

He	
's	V.03
been	V.01
away	
for	
a	
week	
and	
I	
was	V.03
thinking	V.01
of	
waiting	V.01
for	
him	
in	
his	
apartment	
wearing	V.01
only	
his	
dress	
shirt	
.	

It	
s	V.01
still	
a	
fairly	
new	
relationship	V.03
and	
we	
have	V.01
nt	
had	V.LV
sex	V.01
yet	
so	
it	
s	V.01
kind	
of	
a	
big	
deal	V.03
.	

I	
just	
do	V.01
nt	
want	V.01
to	
freak	V.02
him	
out	
or	
make	V.02
him	
feel	V.01
uncomfortable	V.01
.	

Is	V.01
it	
ok	
for	
a	
woman	
in	
french	
culture	
to	
make	V.LV
the	
first	
move	V.02
?	

What	
do	V.01
french	
men	
find	V.02
sexy	
?	

French	
women	
are	V.01
the	
ones	
to	
say	V.01
yes	
,	
the	
way	V.01
we	
say	V.01
it	
is	V.01
not	
usually	
as	
straigthforward	
as	
you	
propose	V.01
to	
do	V.01

I	
used	V.01
Birdies	
for	
our	
Annual	
Walk	
Against	
Drugs	
and	
Alcohol	
event	
.	

They	
were	V.01
very	
professional	
,	
neat	
and	
clean	V.04
.	

They	
came	V.17
through	
on	
all	
of	
their	
promises	V.01
and	
we	
had	V.03
a	
very	
successful	
day

I

They	
do	V.01
have	V.03
a	
good	
selection	V.01
of	
fabric	
and	
notions

It	
was	V.01
ok	
,	
nice	
management	V.01
,	
they	
let	V.01
us	
check	V.02
in	
early	
,	
but	
the	
place	
was	V.01
old	V.01
.	

It	
was	V.01
clean	V.04
,	
but	
just	
a	
little	
dumpy	V.02
.	

Lots	
of	
room

Hard	
to	
get	V.05
into	
though	
because	
of

I	
'll	
admit	V.01
I	
was	V.03
n't	
expecting	V.01
much	
from	
this

they	
really

The	
one	
guy	
who	
was	V.01
there	
,	
I	
'm	V.03
guessing	V.01
was	V.01
the	
owner

was	V.01
probably	
the	
least	
helpful

I	
've	V.01

it	
's	V.01
enough

Chuck

positive	V.02
,	
and	
when	
Alan	
's	
refused	V.01
to	
work	V.01
on	
my	
bike	
,	
Chuck	
came	V.01
right	
out	
and	
saw	V.01
the	
problem	
and	
did	V.02
what	
Alan	
's	
mechanic	
would	
n't	
do	V.02
.	

He	
worked	V.01
on	
it	
right	
on	
the	
back	
of	
my	
car

I	
am	V.01
extremely	
pleased	V.01

Quick	
and	
Cheap	

Walked	V.01
in	
and	
was	V.01
out	
ta	
there	
in	
10	
mins	
with	
a	
really	
good	
deal	V.01
i	
thought	V.01
i	
was	V.03
going	V.04
to	
be	V.03
paying	V.01
a	
lot	
because	
i	
had	V.03
a	
DUI	
but	
with	
my	
DUI	
and	
Sr	
-	
22	
they	
were	V.01
able	V.01
to	
get	V.01
me	
the	
best	
deal	V.01
out	
there	
.	

Is	V.01
not	
a	
service	
office	

This	
is	V.01
a	
delivery	
office	
only	
and	
does	V.01
not	
take	V.01
walk	
ins	
but	
they	
do	V.01
have	V.03
a	
blue	
box	
out	
front	
.	

Glad	
I	
called	V.02
before	
I	
arrived	V.01
with	
my	
box	
to	
ship	V.01
.	

Thought	V.01
adding	V.02
a	
comment	V.01
would	
save	V.01
someone	
the	
hassle	V.02
with	
a	
useless	
trip	V.03
there	
.	

the	
food	
is	V.01
mediocre	
at	
best	
.	

the	
waitress	
took	V.01
my	
name	
and	
then	
called	V.01
me	
that	
all	
night	
.	

not	
sure	
how	
I	
feel	V.01
about	
that	
one	
.	

it	
's	V.01
passable	
as	
a	
pub	
,	
but	
the	
pizza	
is	V.01
not	
that	
great	V.01
.	

if	
you	
want	V.01
good	
pizza	
,	
go	V.02
to	
famoso	
.	

seriously	
.	

Anyone	
else	
find	V.02
it	
a	
little	
suspicious	
that	
there	
are	V.02
not	
only	
20	
reviews	V.01
for	
this	
dentist	
(	
a	
HUGE	
number	
compared	
to	
the	
others	
in	
the	
area	
)	
,	
but	
that	
they	
all	
have	V.03
the	
same	
unique	
grammar	
structure	
?	

And	
they	
seem	V.01
to	
be	V.03
posted	V.01
at	
fairly	
regular	
intervals	
?	

Best	
YET

We	
go	V.02
to	
Japaneiro

Harlan	
provides	V.01
great	
service	V.01

He	
is	V.01
very	
knowledgeable	V.01
and	
took	V.01
the	
time	
to	
explain	V.01
the	
repairs	V.01
to	
me	
.	

The	
work	V.01
on	
my	
car	
was	V.03
done	V.08
quickly	
and	
I	
felt	V.02
I	
could	
trust	V.02
his	
work	V.01
.	

I	
have	V.03
nothing	
but	
fantastic	
things	
to	
say	V.01
.	

I	
highly	
recommend	V.01
his	
shop	
.	

Best	
in	
Memphis	

This	
shop	
is	V.01
by	
far	
the	
best	
I	
have	V.01
been	V.01
to	
.	

I	
have	V.03
a	
Saab	
...	
which	
everything	
is	V.01
expensive	V.02
on	
and	
they	
have	V.01
been	V.01
extrememly	
fair	V.01
and	
price	V.01
a	
lot	
lower	
than	
any	
other	
shop	
I	
called	V.02
.	

They	
are	V.01
the	
only	
place	
I	
would	
take	V.01
my	
car	
peiod	
.	

Took	V.01
a	
laptop	
in	
for	
a	
video	
cable	
to	
be	V.03
replaced	V.01
.	

Everything	
except	
the	
display	
worked	V.09
fine	
before	
I	
took	V.01
it	
in	
.	

The	
video	
cable	
was	V.03
replaced	V.01
and	
suddenly	
the	
motherboard	
was	V.01
dead	
.	

Phone	
calls	V.02
were	V.03
n't	
returned	V.02
when	
promised	V.01
and	
the	
botched	V.01
repair	V.01
took	V.10
a	
week	
longer	
than	
promised	V.01
.	

We	
have	V.01
stayed	V.01
at	
Tanglewood	
for	
many	
years	
now	
.	

We	
go	V.02
over	
about	
5	
times	
a	
year	
.	

We	
have	V.01
never	
had	V.03
a	
problem	
with	
the	
cabins	
.	

They	
are	V.01
always	
so	
helpful	V.04
.	

The	
cabins	
have	V.01
always	
been	V.01
clean	V.04
.	

Helen	
is	V.01
a	
wonderful	
place	
to	
take	V.01
you	
family	
.	

We	
recommend	V.01
these	
cabins	
!	

Ca	
n't	
say	V.01
enough	

I	
used	V.03
to	
tan	V.01
down	
the	
street	
before	
I	
was	V.03
referred	V.02
to	
this

WOW	
!	

I	
did	V.01
n't	
know	V.01
what	
I	
was	V.03
missing	V.01
.	

The	
lowest	
bed	
here	
is	V.01
better	V.02
than	
my	
last	
salon	
s	
highest	
level	
.	

Salon	
is	V.01
clean	V.04
and	
girls	
are	V.01
nice	V.01
.	

Great	
People	
and	
even	
better	
service	V.02
!	

Best	
to	
deal	V.01
with	
!	

In	
a	
few	
words	
...	
I	
'm	V.01
pleasantly	
surprised	V.01
that	
you	
can	
still	
find	V.01
"	
old	
school	
"	
service	V.01
out	
there	
where	
company	
care	V.01
more	
about	
good	
name	
and	
customers	
than	
their	
pockets	
...	

Highly	
recommended	
people	
/	
business	
.	

Thanks	V.01
Josh

Dentist	
you	
can	
trust	V.02

If	
possible	
I	
try	V.01
the	
services	V.01
on	
myself	
before	
I	
bring	V.01
in	
my	
son	
.	

Drs.	
Ali	
work	V.01
wonders	V.02
.	

Neither	
me	
nor	
my	
son	
have	V.01
n't	
had	V.03
a	
single	
cavity	
since	
we	
started	V.01
dental	
care	V.03
there	
.	

The	
team	
focus	
is	V.01
prevention	V.01
and	
education	V.01
.	

That	
alone	
makes	V.02
them	
unique	V.01
.	

This	
is	V.01
not	
your	
usual	
cheap	
hotdog	
place	
.	

They	
offer	V.01
a	
large	
variety	
of	
quality	
hotdogs	
and	
hamburgers	
They	
also	
offer	V.01
veggie	
dogs	
.	

The	
fries	
are	V.01
of	
good	
quality	
,	
the	
staff	
is	V.01
friendly	V.01
.	

The	
atmosphere	
is	V.01
your	
typical	
indie	
outfit	
with	
old	
movie	
posters	
and	
memorabilia	
from	
the	
70's	
and	
80's	
.	

Over	
charged	V.01
.	

I	
used	V.01
my	
card	
to	
purchase	V.01
a	
meal	
on	
the	
menu	
and	
the	
total	
on	
my	
receipt	
was	V.01
$	
8.95	
but	
when	
I	
went	V.02
on	
line	
to	
check	V.01
my	
transaction	V.01
it	
show	V.01
$	
10.74	
.	

There	
is	V.02
something	
wrong	
or	
maybe	
the	
individual	
made	V.LV
a	
mistake	V.02
but	
to	
me	
that	
is	V.01
not	
integrity	
.	

Elmira	
,	
you	
r	V.01
the	
best	
!	

All	
I	
can	
say	V.01
is	V.01
that	
Elmira	
you	
are	V.01
the	
best	
I	
ve	V.01
experienced	V.01
,	
never	
before	
has	V.01
the	
seamstress	
done	V.08
a	
perfect	
job	
until	
i	
met	V.02
you	
.	

I	
recommend	V.01
you	
to	
everyone	
in	
Calgary	
,	
as	
she	
is	V.01
a	
professional	
and	
the	
cost	
for	
her	
was	V.01
low	V.04
.	

5	
star	
detail	
job	

I	
took	V.01
my	
Mustang	
here	
and	
it	
looked	V.02
amazing	V.01
after	
they	
were	V.01
done	V.08
,	
they	
did	V.02
a	
great	
job	
,	
I	
'm	V.01
very	
satisfied	
with	
the	
results	
.	

The	
paint	
and	
wheels	
looked	V.02
like	
glass	
and	
the	
interior	
looked	V.02
new	V.01
!	

Also	
,	
they	
have	V.03
great	
customer	
service	V.02
and	
a	
very	
knowledgeable	
staff
