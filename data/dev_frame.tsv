From	
the	
AP	
comes	V
this	
story	
:	

President	
Bush	
on	
Tuesday	
nominated	V
two	
individuals	
to	
replace	V
retiring	
jurists	
on	
federal	
courts	
in	
the	
Washington	
area

Bush	
nominated	V
Jennifer	
M.	
Anderson	
for	
a	
15

year	
term	
as	
associate	
judge	
of	
the	
Superior	
Court	
of	
the	
District	
of	
Columbia

replacing	V
Steffen	
W.	
Graae

Bush	
also	
nominated	V
A.	
Noel	
Anketell	
Kramer	
for	
a	
15	
-	
year	
term	
as	
associate	
judge	
of	
the	
District	
of	
Columbia	
Court	
of	
Appeals	
,	
replacing	V
John	
Montague	
Steadman

The	
sheikh	
in	
wheel

chair	
has	V
been	V
attacked	V
with	
a	
F	
-	
16

launched	
bomb	
.	

He	
could	
be	V
killed	V
years	
ago	
and	
the	
israelians	
have	V
all	
the	
reasons	
,	
since	
he	
founded	V
and	
he	
is	V
the	
spiritual	
leader	
of	
Hamas	
,	
but	
they	
did	V
n't	
.	

Today	
's	
incident	
proves	V
that	
Sharon	
has	V
lost	V
his	
patience	
and	
his	
hope	V
in	
peace	V
.	

Nervous	
people	
make	V
mistakes	V
,	
so	
I	
suppose	V
there	
will	
be	V
a	
wave	V
of	
succesfull	
arab	
attacks	V

A	
la	
guerre	
c'est	
comme	
a	
la	
guerre	
!	

In	
the	
eastern	
city	
of	
Baqubah	
,	
guerrillas	
detonated	V
a	
car	
bomb	
outside	
a	
police	
station	
,	
killing	V
several	
people	
.	

The	
US	
lost	V
yet	
another	
helicopter	
to	
hostile	
fire	V
near	
Habbaniyah	
in	
the	
Sunni	
heartland	
,	
but	
this	
time	
the	
crew	
was	V
safe	V
.	

In	
Fallujah	
,	
hundreds	
of	
demonstrators	
came	V
out	
against	
US	
troops	
when	
they	
briefly	
arrested	V
a	
yound	
newlywed	
bride	
.	

(	
I	
hope	V
that	
the	
US	
army	
got	V
an	
enormous	
amount	
of	
information	
from	
her	
relatives	
,	
because	
otherwise	
this	
move	V
was	V
a	
bad	
,	
bad	
tradeoff	V
)	
.	

The	
US	
troops	
fired	V
into	
the	
hostile	
crowd	
,	
killing	V

.	

It	
seems	V
clear	V
to	
me	
that	
the	
manhunt	
for	
high	
Baath	
officials	
in	
the	
Sunni	
heartland	
is	V
being	V
done	V
wrong	
,	
or	
at	
least	
in	
ways	V
that	
are	V
bad	V
for	
US	
standing	
with	
local	
Iraqis

Google	
has	V
finally	
had	V
an	
analyst	
day	
--	
a	
chance	V
to	
present	V
the	
company

story	
to	
the	
(	
miniscule	
number	
of

people	
who	
have	V
n't	
heard	V
it

Usually

these	
are	V
just	
a	
chance	V
for	
the	
suckups	
to	
suck	V
up	
,	
but	
this	
time	
people	
are	V
actually	
concerned	V
about	
the	
company

plans	V

They	
work	V
on

when

a

It	
's	V
not	
quite	
as	
freewheeling	
an	
environment	
as	
you	
'd	
imagine	V
:	
Sergey

the

is	V
a

idea

Read	V
the

there	
's	V
a	
punchline

too

My	
opinion	
piece	
on	
the	
implications	V
of	
Arafat	
's	
passing	V
for	
al	
-

has	V
appeared	V
at	
Newsday

Excerpt	
:	

"	
Arafat	
's	
secular	
nationalism	
was	V
supple	V
enough	V
to	
compromise	V
with	
Israel	
and	
to	
imagine	V
a	
two	
-	
state	
solution	V
,	
even	
if	
the	
road	
of	
negotiations	V
remained	V
rocky	
.	

The	
continued	
Israeli	
colonization	V
of	
the	
occupied	
Palestinian	
territories	
during	
the	
1990s	
helped	V
,	
along	
with	
terrorist	
attacks	V
by	
radical	
groups	
such	
as	
Hamas	
,	
to	
derail	V
the	
peace	
process	V
,	
which	
Sharon	
had	V
always	
opposed	V
.	

Arafat	
's	
death	V
creates	V
a	
vacuum	
in	
Palestinian	
leadership	V
that	
will	
not	
soon	
be	V
filled	V
.	

Sharon	
's	
assassination	V
of	
major	
Hamas	
leaders	
has	V
also	
weakened	V
authority	
structures	
in	
that	
party

If	
the	
Israelis	
and	
the	
Palestinian	
leadership	V
can	
not	
find	V
a	
way	V
to	
reinvigorate	V
the	
peace	
process	V
,	
cells	
of	
radical	
young	
Palestinians	
may	
grow	V
up	
that	
look	V
to	
bin	
Laden	
for	
their	
cues

Even	
if	
local	
Palestinian	
leaders	
remain	V
strong	V
enough	V
to	
keep	V
al

Qaida	
out

the	
festering	V
Israeli

Palestinian	
struggle	V
remains	V
among	
the	
best	
recruiting	
posters	
for	
al

Muslim	
men

Resolving	V
this	
conflict	V
would

the	
most

the	
United

could	
deploy	V
in

Radical

apparently

Ever

even

profitable	
business	
model	V

some	
nearly	
flawless	
execution	V

the	
price	V
would	
be	V
too	
high	V

to	
make	V
a	
real	
profit	V

That

What

whether

anything

the

Remember	V
when	
a	
whole

had	V
to	
die	V
because	
a	
Swedish	
newspaper	
printed	V
those	
cartoons

Now	
Iran	
wants	V

is	V
inviting	V
cartoonists	
to	
do	V
their	
best

Amazingly

these	
idiots

"	
They

why

Shojai	
told	V
the	
opening	
ceremony	
of	
the	
month

long	
fair	
in	
Tehran	
's	
Palestine	
Contemporary	
Art

He	
added	V
that	
around	
1,100	
cartoons	
were	V
submitted	V
by	
participants	
from	
more	
than	
60	
countries	
and	
that	
more

200

He	
said	V
the	
top	
three	
cartoons	
will	
be	V
announced	V

September	
2

with	
the	
winners	
being	V
awarded	V
prizes

12,000

8,000

5,000	
dollars	
respectively

This	
cute	
little	
stunt	V
is	V
only	
going	V

prove	V
just	
how

When	
they	
saw	V

If

n't	
blog	V
much	
right	
now	
but	
will	
try	V
to	
catch	V
up	
the	
next	
couple	
of	
days	
.	
]	

The	
hottest	
item	
on	
Christmas	
wish	
lists	
this	
year	
is	V
nuclear	
weapons	
.	

Al	
-	
Qaeda	
wants	V
them	
,	
Iran	
wants	V
them	
,	
Russia	
wants	V
the	
better	
ones	
,	
and	
all	
the	
US	
wants	V
is	V
to	
give	V
them	
all	
a	
piece	
of	
coal	
.	

For	
the	
last	
few	
years	
there	
have	V
been	V
tensions	V
with	
Iran	
’s	
nuclear	
program	
with	
word	
coming	V
this	
week	
that	
a	
deal	V
was	V
reached	V
through	
the	
European	
Union	
that	
meets	V
with	
the	
approval	V
of	
the	
International	
Atomic	
Energy	
Agency	
.	

At	
the	
same	
time	
,	
an	
Iranian	
Opposition	
Group	
released	V
what	
they	
call	V
proof	V
of	
a	
covert	
nuclear	
weapons	
program	
.	

Arial	
photos	V
,	
loose	
connections	V
to	
AQ	
Kahn	
and	
Libya	
make	V
up	
the	
evidence	
that	
the	
group	
presented	V
.	

Russia	
also	
announced	V
that	
it	
was	V
seeking	V
and	
building	V
the	
best	
nukes	
the	
world	
’s	V
ever	
seen	V
.	

President	
Vladimir	
Putin	
said	V
Russia	
is	
will	
have	V
new	
nuclear	
weapons	
that	
other	
countries	
do	V
not	
and	
will	
not	
have	V
.	

With	
the	
demand	V
so	
high	V
,	
the	
question	V
arises	V
on	
to	
who	
should	
be	V
or	
has	V
the	
right	V
to	
be	V
the	
Santa	
of	
nuclear	
weapons	
.	

Right	
now	
that	
seems	V
to	
be	V
the	
US	
,	
EU	
,	
and	
IAEA	
.	

But	
not	
always	
do	V
those	
three	
agree	V
,	
and	
not	
always	
are	V
their	
decisions	V
equal	V
.	

The	
US	
has	V
strongly	
opposed	V
a	
nuclear	
weapons	
program	
of	
Iran	
,	
yet	
Israel	
,	
which	
to	
this	
day	
has	V
never	
officially	
said	V
that	
they	
posses	V
nuclear	
weapons	
,	
ranks	V
around	
fifth	
in	
nuclear	
strength	
.	

It	
is	V
estimated	V
that	
Israel	
has	V
over	
200	
nuclear	
weapons	
yet	
neither	
the	
US	
nor	
any	
of	
her	
allies	
expresses	V
the	
slightest	
concern	V
.	

North	
Korea	
’s	
Kim	
Jong	
Ill	
also	
has	V
the	
bomb	
at	
the	
top	
of	
his	
list	
and	
Santa	
seems	V
to	
have	V
already	
come	V
a	
few	
years	
ago	
.	

It	
is	V
rumored	V
that	
North	
Korea	
has	V
at	
least	
a	
couple	
nuclear	
weapons	
.	

But	
getting	V
past	
who	
should	
get	V
them	
,	
is	V
who	
has	V
them	
,	
and	
who	
is	V
really	
close	V
.	

The	
case	V
against	
Iran	
has	V
a	
feeling	V
of	
Déjà	
vu	
.	

Arial	
photos	V
of	
the	
lab	
were	V
uranium	
is	V
being	V
enriched	V
,	
somewhat	
like	
those	
of	
chemical	
weapons	
stockpiles	
in	
Iraq	
.	

America	
cried	V
wolf	
in	
Iraq	
,	
and	
what	
’s	V
scary	V
is	V
that	
sooner	
or	
later	
,	
that	
wolf	
will	
probably	
get	V
us	
.	

I	
ran	V
across	
this	
item	
on	
the	
Internet	
.	

Sooooo	
.	

The	
United	
States	
goes	V
into	
a	
war	
zone	
and	
evacuates	V
a	
bunch	
of	
U.S.	
citizens	
(	
most	
of	
whom	
were	V
"	
dual	
-	
citizens	
"	
)	
.	

Then	
,	
eschewing	V
normal	
procedure	V
,	
the	
Department	
of	
State	
waived	V
the	
fees	
that	
they	
charge	V
for	
evacuating	V
U.S.	
citizen	
.	

Why	
?	

To	
pander	V
to	
the	
mythical	
"	
Arab	
street	
"	
,	
of	
course	
.	

Now	
,	
I	
would	
argue	V
that	
one	
could	
have	V
reasonably	
predicted	V
that	
some	
form	
of	
military	
violence	
was	V
likely	V
to	
occur	V
in	
Lebanon	
(	
considering	V
that	
the	
country	
has	V
been	V
experiencing	V
some	
form	
of	
conflict	V
for	
approximately	
the	
last	
32	
years	
)	
.	

In	
other	
words	
,	
those	
Americans	
were	V
there	
by	
their	
own	
choice	V
,	
mired	V
in	
a	
situation	
that	
was	V
totally	
predictable	V
.	

Yet	
we	
did	V
n't	
charge	V
them	
for	
the	
evacuation	V
.	

This	
is	V
unlike	
the	
situation	
last	
year	
in	
Asia	
when	
we	
evacuated	V
U.S.	
citizens	
from	
areas	
that	
were	V
hit	V
by	
the	
tsunami	V
-	
a	
phenomenon	
that	
is	V
much	
less	
predictable	V
than	
the	
Hezbollah	
-	
provoked	
destruction	V
that	
rained	V
down	
on	
Lebanon	
.	

And	
what	
do	V
we	
get	V
for	
this	
effort	V
?	

A	
lawsuit	
.	

That	
's	V
right	V
,	
folks	
.	

The	
American	
-	
Arab	
Discrimination	
Committee	
is	V
suing	V
Condoleeza	
Rice	
and	
Donald	
Rumsfeld	
,	
charging	V
that	
they	
mismanaged	V
the	
evacuation	
efforts	V
.	

Here	
's	V
an	
excerpt	
from	
the	
article	
:	

Nina	
Chahine	
,	
19	
,	
who	
with	
her	
family	
was	V
among	
the	
named	
plaintiffs	
in	
the	
lawsuit	
,	
said	V
her	
wedding	V
in	
the	
southern	
city	
of	
Tyre	
was	V
set	V
for	
July	
13	
.	

The	
wedding	V
had	V
to	
be	V
postponed	V
as	
family	
members	
fled	V
the	
outbreak	V
of	
the	
war	V
,	
she	
said	V
.	

"	
We	
were	V
on	
the	
road	
and	
the	
first	
bridge	
was	V
bombed	V
and	
we	
drove	V
home	
and	
all	
the	
other	
bridges	
were	V
bombed	V
and	
there	
was	V
absolutely	
no	
way	V
for	
us	
to	
get	V
home	
,	
"	
Chahine	
told	V
reporters	
outside	
federal	
court	
in	
Detroit	
.	

"	
We	
were	V
all	
American	
citizens	
and	
there	
was	V
no	
way	V
that	
anybody	
helped	V
us	
.	

No	
communications	V
nothing	
.	

I	
was	V
on	
my	
way	V
to	
my	
wedding	V
fearing	V
death	V
,	
basically	
.	
"	

Chahine	
said	V
her	
immediate	
family	
spent	V
about	
$	
20,000	
to	
return	V
to	
Detroit	
via	
Syria	
and	
Jordan	
.	

Dear	
Nina	
,	

Here	
's	V
a	
tip	V
:	
Do	V
n't	
get	V
married	V
in	
countries	
that	
house	V
illegal	
militias	
that	
attack	V
other	
countries	
and	
hence	
are	V
likely	V
to	
come	V
under	
counter-attack	
!	

Crap	
like	
this	
sure	
makes	V
me	
want	V
to	
rush	V
right	
out	
and	
rescue	V
people	
from	
dilemmas	
of	
their	
own	
making	V
.	

Though	
I	
am	V
loathe	
to	
quote	V
other	
writers	
at	
legnth	
in	
this	
space	
,	
this	
little	
bit	
from	
Dan	
Froomkin	
's	
"	
White	
House	
Briefing	
"	
column	
in	
the	
WashPost	
today	
is	V
just	
too	
good	V
to	
pass	V
up	
(	
read	V
the	
whole	
column	
here	
)	
:	

At	
the	
Ask	V
the	
President	
event	
on	
Friday	
,	
one	
of	
the	
questions	V
was	V
about	
whether	
Bush	
has	V
any	
thoughts	V
about	
his	
memoirs	
.	

This	
is	V
one	
example	
of	
what	
happens	V
when	
Bush	
gets	V
a	
question	V
that	
he	
has	V
n't	
anticipated	V
.	

"	
Q	
Thank	V
you	
--	
I	
was	V
wondering	V
,	
there	
's	V
a	
lot	
of	
talk	V
right	
now	
about	
memoirs	
being	V
written	V
with	
the	
former	
President	
.	

After	
you	
are	V
elected	V
in	
2004	
,	
what	
will	
your	
memoirs	
say	V
about	
you	
,	
what	
will	
the	
title	
be	V
,	
and	
what	
will	
the	
main	
theme	
say	V
?	

"	
THE	
PRESIDENT	
:	
I	
appreciate	V
that	
.	

(	
Laughter

There	
is	V
a	
painting	V
on	
my	
wall	
in	
the	
Oval	
--	
first	
of	
all	
,	
I	
do	V
n't	
know	V
.	

I	
'm	V
just	
speculating	V
now	
.	

I	
really	
have	V
n't	
thought	V
about	
writing	V
a	
book	
.	

My	
life	
is	V
too	
complicated	V
right	
now	
trying	V
to	
do	V
my	
job	
.	

(	
Laughter	
.	
)	

But	
if	
--	
there	
's	V
a	
painting	V
on	
the	
wall	
in	
the	
Oval	
Office	
that	
shows	V
a	
horseman	
charging	V
up	
a	
steep	
cliff	
,	
and	
there	
are	V
at	
least	
two	
other	
horsemen	
following	V
.	

It	
's	V
a	
Western	
scene	
by	
a	
guy	
named	V
W.H.S.	
Koerner	
called	V
'	
A	
Charge	
to	
Keep	V
.	
'	

It	
's	V
on	
loan	V
,	
by	
the	
way	V
,	
from	
a	
guy	
named	V
Joe	
O'Neill	
in	
Midland	
,	
Texas	
.	

He	
was	V
the	
person	
,	
he	
and	
his	
wife	
Jan	
,	
introduced	V
--	
reintroduced	V
me	
and	
Laura	
in	
his	
backyard	
in	
July	
of	
1977	
.	

Four	
months	
later	
,	
we	
were	V
married	V
.	

So	
he	
's	V
got	V
a	
--	
I	
'm	V
a	
decision	
-	
maker	
and	
I	
can	
make	V
good	
decisions	V
.	

(	
Applause	
.	
)	

"	
And	
so	
we	
sang	V
this	
hymn	
--	
this	
is	V
a	
long	
story	
trying	V
to	
get	V
to	
your	
answer	V
.	

(	
Laughter	
.

This	
is	V
not	
a	
filibuster

(	
Laughter

That	
's	V
a	
Senate	
term	
--	
particularly	
on	
good	
judges	
.	

(	
Applause	
.	
)	

The	
hymn	
was	V
sung	V
at	
my	
first	
inaugural	
church	
service	V
as	
governor	
.	

Laura	
and	
I	
are	V
Methodists	
.	

One	
of	
the	
Wesley	
boys	
wrote	V
the	
hymn	
.	

The	
painting	V
is	V
based	V
upon	
the	
hymn	
called	V
,	
'	
A	
Charge	
to	
Keep	V
.	
'	

I	
have	V
.	

The	
hymn	
talks	V
about	
serving	V
something	
greater	
than	
yourself	
in	
life	
.	

I	
--	
which	
I	
try	V
to	
do	V
,	
as	
best	
as	
I	
possibly	
can

"	
The	
book

I	
guess	V
one	
way	V

one	
thing	
to	
think	V
about	
it

--	
one	
of	
the	
themes	
would	
be	V
,	
I	
was	V
given	V
a	
charge	V
to	
keep	V

And	
I	
gave	V
it	
all	
my	
heart

all	
my	
energy

Now	
that	
's	V
a	
rambling	
response	V

And	
I	
have	V
to	
wonder	V
:	
Did	V
he	
forget	V
that	
he	
already	
has	V
a	
memoir	
called	V
"	
A	
Charge	
to	
Keep	V
"	
?	

That	
was	V
the	
name	
of	
his	
"	
autobiography

--	
ghost	
-	
written	V
by	
adviser	
Karen	
Hughes	
in	
1999

There	
has	V
been	V
random	
speculation	V
about	
Google	
developiong	V
a	
new	
browser	
and	
/	
or	
acquiring	V
Firefox	
.	

It	
is	V
true	V
that	
Google	
has	V
been	V
in	
acquisition

They

acquired	V

,	
Applied	
Semantics	
,	
Picasa	
,	
Blogger	
,	
and	
satellite	
imaging	V
company	
Keyhole	
,	
so	
why	
not	
Firefox	
?	

I	
have	V
no	
inside	
information

but	
I	
have	V
been	V
following	V
links	
today	
that	
strongly	
indicate	V
that

damn	
serious	V
about	
securing	V
permanent	
control	V

Ben	
Goodger

Ben	
made	V
another	
announcement	V
on	
March	
28	
,	
2005	
:	

I	
want	V
to	
use	V
this	
opportunity	
to	
welcome	V
Brian	
Ryner	
to	
Google	
!	

Brian	
has	V
been	V
one	
of	
the	
most	
crucial	
elements	
to	
the	
success	V
of	
Mozilla	
software	
over	
the	
past	
few	
years

...	

Great	
to	
have	V
you	
on	
board	
!	

Now	
,	
none	
of	
this	
has	V
been	V
confirmed	V
by	
Google	
at	
the	
present	
time	
,	
but	
it	
's	V
an	
old	
adage	
that	
you	
follow	V
the	
money	
to	
see	V
who	
is	V
behind	
something	
.	

In	
this	
case	V
,	
following	V
the	
talent	
leads	V
me	
to	
think	V
that	
Google	
will	
be	V
making	V
an	
announcement	V
this	
year	
that	
formalizes	V
the	
Google	
-	
Mozilla	
/	
Firefox	
relationship	V
.	

If	
you	
have	V
not	
already	
seen	V
the	
Flash	
movie	
Epic	
,	
you	
should	
take	V
a	
few	
minutes	
and	
view	V
the	
future	
history	
of	
media	
as	
conceived	V
by	
Robin	
Sloan	
and	
Matt	
Thompson	
,	
with	
music

Aaron	
McLeran

In	
this

Google

Amazon	
(	
GOOGLEZON	
)	
create	V
a	
brave	
new	
world	
of	
media	
in	
2008	
.	

This	
is	V
one	
thought	
-	
provoking	
film

Every	
move	V
Google	
makes	V

this	
particular	
future	
closer

Just	
one	
small	
commment	
-	
it	
's	V
not	
possible	V
,	
as	
far	
as	
I	
know	V
,	
for	
Google	
to	
"	
Aquire	V
"	
Firefox	
.	

They	
already	
have	V
rights	V
to	
take	V
it	
,	
alter	V
it	
,	
and	
release	V
those	
changes	V
to	
the	
world	
-	
this	
is	V
what	
the	
whole	
open	
source	
thing	
is	V
about	
.	

I	
'm	V
inclined	V
to	
say	V
that	
google	
is	V
doing	V
what	
they	
can	
to	
both	
shape	V
and	
support	V
the	
growth	
of	
the	
most	
popular	
non-Microsoft	
browser	
out	
there	
-	
by	
taking	V
on	
the	
leading	
lights	
in	
Firefox	
development	V
,	
they	
're	V
ensuring	V
the	
continued	
life	
of	
the	
project	
,	
and	
ensuring	V
(	
not	
that	
I	
think	V
they	
need	V
to	
)	
that	
their	
voice	V
will	
be	V
heard	V
admidst	
the	
higher	
echelons	
of	
the	
firefox	
development	V
team	
.	

It	
's	V
this	
sort	
of	
enlightened	
self	
interest	V
that	
keeps	V
large	
open	
source	
projects	
alive	V
.	

Fascinating	
viewpoint	
of	
the	
future	
in	
Epic	
.	

Thanks	V
for	
the	
link

Malach	
,	
What	
you	
say	V
makes	V
sense	V
.	

Acquiring	V
open	
source	
talent	
gives	V
a	
company	
an	
inexpensive	
way	V
of	
influencing	V
and	
anticipating	V
the	
direction	
an	
open	
source	
project	
will	
go	V
.	

It	
probably	
gives	V
more	
bang	
for	
the	
buck	
than	
acquiring	V
a	
private	
company	
and	
having	V
to	
handle	V
the	
inevitable	
culture	
clashes	V
and	
process	
mis-matches	
.	

The	
Coalition	
decision	V
to	
provoke	V
a	
fight	V
with	
Muqtada	
al	
-	
Sadr	
's	
movement	V
only	
three	
months	
before	
the	
Coalition	
Provisional	
Authority	
goes	V
out	
of	
business	
has	V
to	
be	V
seen	V
as	
a	
form	
of	
gross	
incompetence	
in	
governance	V
.	

How	
did	V
the	
CPA	
get	V
to	
the	
point	
where	
it	
has	V
turned	V
even	
Iraqi	
Shiites	
,	
who	
were	V
initially	
grateful	V
for	
the	
removal	V
of	
Saddam	
Hussein	
,	
against	
the	
United	
States	
?	

Where	
it	
risks	V
fighting	V
dual	
Sunni	
Arab	
and	
Shiite	
insurgencies	
simultaneously	
,	
at	
a	
time	
when	
US	
troops	
are	V
rotating	V
on	
a	
massive	
scale	
and	
hoping	V
to	
downsize	V
their	
forces	
in	
country	
?	

At	
a	
time	
when	
the	
Spanish	
,	
Thai	
and	
other	
contingents	
are	V
already	
committed	V
to	
leaving	V
,	
and	
the	
UN	
is	V
reluctant	V
to	
get	V
involved	V
?	

One	
answer	V
is	V
that	
the	
Pentagon	
prevented	V
the	
State	
Department	
from	
running	V
the	
CPA	
.	

State	
is	V
the	
body	
with	
experience	V
in	
international	
affairs	
and	
administration	V
.	

The	
civilians	
in	
the	
Department	
of	
Defense	
only	
know	V
how	
to	
blow	V
things	
up	
.	

Rumsfeld	
,	
Wolfowitz	
and	
Feith	
staffed	V
the	
CPA	
with	
Neoconservatives	
,	
most	
of	
whom	
had	V
no	
administrative	
experience	V
,	
no	
Arabic	
,	
and	
no	
respect	V
for	
Muslim	
culture	
(	
or	
knowledge	
about	
it	
)	
.	

They	
actively	
excluded	V
State	
Department	
Iraq	
hands	
like	
Tom	
Warrick	
.	

(	
Only	
recently	
have	V
a	
few	
experienced	
State	
Department	
Arabists	
been	V
allowed	V
in	
to	
try	V
to	
begin	V
mopping	V
up	
the	
mess	
.	
)	

The	
Neocons	
in	
the	
CPA	
have	V
all	
sorts	
of	
ulterior	
motives	
and	
social	
experiments	V
they	
want	V
to	
impose	
on	
the	
Iraqi	
people	
,	
including	
Polish	
-	
style	
economic	
shock	V
therapy	
,	
some	
sort	
of	
sweetheart	
deal	V
for	
Israel	
,	
and	
maybe	
even	
breaking	V
the	
country	
up	
into	
three	
parts	
.	

The	
Washington	
Monthly	
's	
Who	
's	V
Who	
of	
Neocons	
in	
Iraq	
helps	V
explain	V
the	
extreme	
incompetence	
and	
possibly	
double	
-	
dealing	V
of	
many	
in	
the	
CPA	
.	

Sept.	
11	
Commission	
member	
Philip	
Zelikow	
,	
who	
is	V
close	V
to	
the	
Bush	
administration	V
,	
admitted	V
on	
Sept.	
10	
,	
2002	
,	
that	
the	
ulterior	
motive	
of	
the	
Bush	
administration	V
for	
the	
Iraq	
War	
was	V
to	
"	
protect	V
Israel	
,	
"	
according	
to	
the	
Asian	
Times	
.	

I	
have	V
long	
been	V
a	
trenchant	
critic	
of	
the	
Sadrists	
.	

But	
they	
have	V
n't	
been	V
up	
to	
anything	
extraordinary	
as	
far	
as	
I	
can	
see	V
in	
recent	
weeks	
.	

Someone	
in	
the	
CPA	
sat	V
down	
and	
thought	V
up	
ways	V
to	
stir	V
them	
up	
by	
closing	V
their	
newspaper	
and	
issuing	V
28	
arrest	
warrants	
and	
taking	V
in	
people	
like	
Yaqubi	
.	

This	
is	V
either	
gross	
incompetence	
or	
was	V
done	V
with	
dark	
ulterior	
motives	
that	
can	
scarcely	
be	V
guessed	V
at	
.	

There	
is	V
a	
classical	
logical	
fallacy	
,	
post	
hoc	
ergo	
propter	
hoc	
(	
Z	
happens	V
after	
X	
,	
therefore	
Z	
is	V
caused	V
by	
X	
)	
,	
and	
I	
keep	V
revising	V
this	
posting	V
this	
evening	
because	
I	
do	V
n't	
want	V
to	
fall	V
into	
it	
.	

But	
sometimes	
,	
of	
course	
,	
when	
Z	
happens	V
after	
X	
it	
is	V
because	
of	
X	
.	

So	
I	
may	
as	
well	
just	
come	V
out	
with	
it	
:	
It	
is	V
pretty	
suspicious	
,	
given	
the	
Neocon	
predominance	
in	
the	
CPA	
and	
in	
the	
upper	
reaches	
of	
the	
Defense	
Department	
that	
on	
April	
2	
AP	
reported	V
of	
Muqtada	
:	

'	
A	
radical	
Shiite	
Muslim	
cleric	
has	V
expressed	V
solidarity	
with	
the	
militant	
Palestinian	
group	
Hamas	
and	
said	V
that	
he	
should	
be	V
considered	V
the	
group	
's	
"	
striking	
arm	
"	
in	
Iraq	
.	

"	
I	
have	V
said	V
and	
I	
repeat	V
my	
expression	V
of	
solidarity	
which	
Hassan	
Nasrallah	
called	V
for	
to	
stand	V
with	
Hamas	
,	
"	
Shiite	
cleric	
Muqtada	
al	
-	
Sadr	
said	V
Friday	
in	
a	
reference	V
to	
Nasrallah	
,	
the	
leader	
of	
the	
militant	
Lebanese	
Shiite	
group	
Hezbollah	
.	

Last	
month	
,	
Nasrallah	
announced	V
that	
his	
party	
would	
close	V
ranks	
with	
Hamas	
.	

"	
Let	V
(	
Hamas	
)	
consider	V
me	
their	
striking	
arm	
in	
Iraq	
because	
the	
fate	
of	
Iraq	
and	
Palestine	
is	V
the	
same	
,	
"	
al	
-	
Sadr	
said	V
during	
a	
Friday	
prayer	
sermon	
in	
Kufa	
,	
his	
home	
base	
south	
of	
Baghdad	
.	

He	
did	V
comment	V
on	
what	
he	
meant	V
by	
the	
phrase	
.	
'	

And	
on	
April	
3	
his	
chief	
aide	
in	
Najaf	
was	V
suddenly	
arrested	V
along	
with	
13	
other	
members	
of	
his	
organization	
,	
and	
the	
Coalition	
forces	
are	V
put	V
into	
violent	
conflict	V
with	
his	
organization	
,	
which	
leaves	V
7	
US	
soldiers	
dead	
.	

The	
Army	
is	V
unlikely	V
to	
forgive	V
or	
forget	V
;	
but	
who	
provoked	V
it	
and	
why	
?	

I	
'm	V
not	
even	
in	
Iraq	
and	
I	
could	
have	V
predicted	V
to	
you	
the	
consequences	
of	
doing	V
what	
the	
CPA	
has	V
been	V
doing	V

Anthony	
Shadid	
of

Washington	
Post	
reveals	V
that	
the	
warrants	
for	
the	
arrests	V

All	
:	

It	
is	V
my	
understanding	V
,	
from	
good	
sources	
in	
the	
Gov	
s	
office	
that	
the	
Gov	
will	
order	V
Loretta	
Lynch	
to	
expeditiously	
implement	V
the	
provision	V
to	
suspend	V
all	
parties	
auhtority	
to	
enter	V
into	
direct	
access	V
contracts	
.	

The	
premise	
with	
which	
the	
administartion	
is	V
acting	V
is	V
that	
if	
they	
expeditiously	
suspend	V
everyone	
's	
right	V
to	
bilateral	
contracts	
quickly	
,	
it	
sets	V
up	
a	
barrier	
which	
the	
direct	
access	V
coalition	
must	
break	V
through	
.	

In	
other	
words	
the	
table	
is	V
set	V
.	

Deal	V
your	
meal	
from	
where	
the	
dishes	
are	V
located	V
.	

I.E.	
the	
Davis	
Administration	V
wants	V
to	
place	V
all	
direct	
access	
advocates	
in	
the	
position	
of	
having	V
to	
justify	V
why	
each	
and	
every	
party	
should	
be	V
the	
exception	V
to	
the	
suspension	V
rather	
than	
have	V
a	
general	
rule	V
concerning	
how	
direct	
access	V
should	
work	V
for	
all	
parties	
.	

It	
clearly	
gives	V
the	
Admin	
a	
very	
strong	
upper	
hand	
to	
control	V
who	
when	
and	
where	
direct	
access	V
can	
occur	V
without	
having	V
to	
say	V
that	
they	
oppose	V
direct	
access	V
.	

Power	
be	V
where	
power	
lies	V
.	

you	
are	V
n't	
going	V
in	
for	
the	
wedding	V

I	
spoke	V
to	
Bruce	
Garcey	
at	
NiMo	
regarding	
their	
RFP	
.	

Bruce	
indicated	V
NiMo	
short	
listed	V
five	
companies	
who	
all	
bid	V
higher	
than	
ENA	
.	

However	
,	
he	
also	
mentioned	V
we	
were	V
a	
close	
sixth	
,	
that	
is	V
close	V
to	
the	
fifth	
highest	
bid	V
.	

He	
gave	V
no	
indication	V
on	
the	
value	
of	
the	
highest	
bid	V
.	

He	
also	
said	V
that	
the	
other	
five	
companies	
making	V
the	
short	
list	
all	
proposed	V
alternative	
structures	
to	
the	
proposed	
NiMo	
Tier	
Structure	
.	

NiMo	
released	V
an	
additional	
RFP	
for	
peaking	V
supplies	V
for	
this	
winter	
,	
I	
believe	V
Phil	
should	
have	V
or	
be	V
getting	V
that	
RFP

Phil	
if

transporting	V

is	V
subject

She	
was	V
instructed	V

destroy	V
the

another	
would

Glad	
to	
hear	V
all	
is	V
well	V
.	

I	
meant	V
to	
comment	V
that	
I	
thought	V
the	
people	
profiled	V
in	
the	
article	
should	
pull	V
their	
heads	
out	
of	
their	
self	
important	
asses	
.	

It	
is	V
n't	
about	
finding	V
the	
meaning	V
of	
life	
at	
work	V
.	

It	
is	V
all	
about	
the	
$$$	
.	

Work	V
hard	
.	

Make	V
$$$	
.	

Retire	V
young	V
.	

Things	
with	
me	
are	V
great	V
.	

Moving	
back	
to	
Calgary	
in	
about	
a	
month	
which	
is	V
a	
little	
sooner	
than	
I	
thought	V
I	
would	
be	V
going	V
back	
but	
when	
opportunity	
knocks	V
you	
got	V
ta	
go	V
.	

Take	V
care	V
.	

I	
do	V
n't	
hear	V
from	
you	
in	
months	
and	
then	
you	
level	V
me	
with	
such	
a	
thought	
provoking	
,	
soul	
searching	
article	
.	

Thanks	V
for	
thinking	V
of	
me	
to	
send	V
it	
to	
.	

I	
really	
enjoyed	V
reading	V
it	
.	

We	
certainly	
fit	V
into	
certain	
parts	
of	
the	
article	
.	

There	
are	V
a	
few	
life	
theories	
like	
that	
which	
working	V
through	
.	

It	
s	V
all	
interesting	
stuff	
.	

How	
are	V
things	
going	V
with	
you	
?	

Are	V
you	
enjoying	V
Houston	
?	

London	
has	V
been	V
great	V
.	

Brokering	V
over	
here	
has	V
been	V
pretty	
rewarding	
.	

Traders	
over	
here	
seem	V
to	
have	V
a	
lot	
more	
respect	V
for	
other	
humans	
.	

Catriona	
is	V
well	V
and	
has	V
landed	V
herself	
a	
pretty	
cool	
job	
in	
PR

Keep	V

I	
was	V
thinking	V
of	
converting	V
it	
to	
a	
hover	
vehicle	
.	

I	
might	
just	
sell	V
the	
car	
and	
get	V
you	
to	
drive	V
me	
around	
all	
winter	
.	

How	
about	
skidoo	
skis	
for	
the	
front	
and	
tracks	
for	
the	
back

I

You	
have	V
always	
been	V
on	
the	
move	V
seeking	V
affectionate	
,	
satisfying	
and	
harmonious	
relationships	V
.	

Your	
ultimate	
goal	
has	V
been	V
the	
realisation	V
of	
an	
intimate	
union	V
in	
which	
there	
could	
be	V
love	V
,	
self	
-	
sacrifice	V
and	
mutual	
trust	
.	

It	
has	V
often	
been	V
said	V
that	
"	
True	
love	V
is	V
just	
around	
the	
corner	
"	
...	
and	
maybe	
...	
if	
you	
have	V
n't	
found	V
it	
as	
yet	
-	
you	
possibly	
soon	
will	
.	

In	
the	
past	
there	
have	V
been	V
..	
and	
maybe	
there	
still	
are	V
many	
things	
that	
you	
have	V
had	V
to	
do	V
without	
.	

You	
have	V
now	
decided	V
to	
set	V
your	
sights	V
on	
a	
position	
or	
situation	
that	
could	
give	V
you	
greater	
prestige	
and	
which	
will	
afford	V
you	
considerable	
self	
esteem	
.	

You	
wear	V
your	
heart	
on	
your	
sleeve	
...	
and	
since	
you	
are	V
an	
emotional	
person	
you	
are	V
apt	V
to	
give	V
your	
all	
...	
heart	
and	
soul	
...	
to	
all	
those	
that	
show	V
you	
a	
little	
affection	V
...	
but	
take	V
care	V
...	
it	
would	
appear	V
that	
you	
have	V
been	V
extremely	
hurt	V
in	
the	
past	
...	
and	
you	
keep	V
leaving	V
yourself	
wide	
open	V
for	
punishment	V
..	

Whatever	
you	
strive	V
to	
do	V
,	
something	
always	
seems	V
to	
be	V
holding	V
you	
back	
.	

There	
is	V
no	
subterfuge	
in	
you	
.	

You	
are	V
a	
clear	
thinker	
and	
all	
you	
demand	V
from	
life	
,	
in	
a	
relationship	V
,	
is	V
a	
partner	
whom	
you	
can	
trust	V
and	
with	
whom	
you	
can	
,	
together	
,	
develop	V
a	
foundation	
of	
trust	
based	
on	
understanding	V
.	

You	
are	V
your	
own	
person	
...	
and	
you	
demand	V
freedom	
of	
thought	V
...	
to	
follow	V
your	
own	
convictions	V
.	

You	
have	V
no	
interest	V
in	
"	
two	
-	
timing	V
"	
and	
all	
you	
seek	V
is	V
sincerity	
and	
"	
straight	
-	
dealing	V
"	
.	

You	
wish	V
to	
be	V
left	V
in	
peace	V
...	
no	
more	
conflict	V
and	
no	
more	
differences	V
of	
opinion	
...	

In	
fact	
you	
just	
do	V
n't	
want	V
to	
be	V
involved	V
in	
any	
arguments	V
of	
any	
shape	V
or	
form	
...	

All	
you	
want	V
is	V
for	
"	
them	
"	
to	
get	V
on	
with	
it	
-	
and	
to	
leave	V
you	
alone	V
..

Vince	

Dear	
All	
,	

My	
mane	
is	V
Visit	
Phunnarungsi	
.	

I	
used	V
to	
e-mail	V
Vince	
Kaminski	
about	
the	
advice	
on	
his	
article	
"	
The	
Challenge	
of	
Pricing	V
and	
Risk	
Managing	V
Electricity	
Derivatives	
"	
and	
he	
had	V
mailed	V
me	
the	
copy	V
.	

I	
am	V
now	
modelling	V
the	
Queensland	
electricity	
spot	
price	V
using	V
Geometric	
Brownian	
Mean	
Reverting	V
Jump	
Diffusion	V
Model	V
and	
have	V
followed	V
your	
paper	
"	
Making	V
the	
most	
of	
mean	
reversion	
"	
to	
estimate	V
the	
mean	
reversion	V
speed	
.	

I	
use	V
Queensland	
half	
-	
hourly	
price	V
during	
13	
December	
,	
1998	
-	
30	
June	
2001	
giving	V
about	
44,000	
price	
observations	V
.	

However	
,	
the	
result	
from	
Ordinary	
Least	
Squares	
was	V
not	
as	
expected	V
due	
to	
different	
sign	V
for	
both	
slope	
&	
intercept	
.	

The	
coefficient	
and	
standard	
error	V
are	V
as	
followed	V
:	

Intercept	
:	
-	
0.3931	
(	
0.0076	
)	

Slope	
:	
0.1171	
(	
0.0022	
)	

R	
Square	
:	
0.0585	

Therefore	
I	
could	
not	
estimate	V
the	
mean	
reversion	V
rate	
as	
the	
estimated	
slope	
has	V
the	
positive	
sign	V
.	

I	
have	V
also	
tried	V
monthly	
data	
and	
the	
results	
are	V
the	
same	
.	

It	
would	
be	V
appreciated	V
if	
you	
could	
advice	V
me	
on	
this	
matter	
.

Vince

Thanks	V
for	
the	
message	
regarding	
a	
possible	
intern	
for	
your	
group	
.	

Right	
now	
,	
we	
are	V
in	
the	
process	V
of	
evaluating	V
both	
our	
new	
hire	
needs	V
and	
our	
summer	
needs	V
and	
will	
be	V
making	V
those	
decisions	V
after	
the	
first	
of	
the	
year	
.	

Until	
we	
have	V
come	V
up	
with	
those	
numbers	
it	
would	
be	V
premature	V
to	
make	V
any	
offers	V
for	
the	
summer	
.	

What	
I	
would	
like	V
to	
do	V
in	
this	
case	
is	V
get	V
the	
information	
to	
Jeff	
Davis	
,	
who	
is	V
responsible	V
for	
Georgia	
Tech	
and	
ask	V
him	
to	
get	V
Sungjoo	
's	
resume	
and	
start	V
a	
file	
on	
him	
with	
a	
notation	V
that	
you	
would	
like	V
to	
hire	V
him	
for	
summer	
.	

When	
we	
start	V
the	
summer	
process	V

I	
have	V
visited	V
Georgia	
Tech	
on	
Thursday	
.	

One	
of	
the	
students	
indicated	V
that	
he	
is	V
interested	V
in	
a	
summer	
internship	
.	

He	
came	V
across	
as	
a	
very	
bright	
person	
,	
very	
personable	
.	

I	
can	
take	V
him	
as	
a	
summer	
intern	
.

Dear	
Dr.	
Vincent	
Kaminski	
,	

Hi	
.	

How	
are	V
you	
doing	V
?	

I	
hope	V
you	
have	V
a	
good	
flight	V
back	
to	
home	
.	

It	
was	V
a	
good	
opportunity	
to	
know	V
about	
Enron	
and	
its	
finance	
sector	
.	

Thank	V
you	
for	
your	
time	
.	

I	
have	V
already	
submitted	V
my	
resume	
and	
cover	
letter	
right	
after	
the	
talk	V
.	

However	
,	
you	
ask	V
me	
to	
send	V
a	
copy	V
of	
resume	
and	
cover	
letter	
again	
.	

Those	
attachments	V
are	V
what	
I	
was	V
asked	V
.	

Again	
,	
it	
was	V
a	
good	
chance	V
for	
me	
to	
get	V
to	
know	V
what	
I	
can	
do	V
in	
this	
field	
and	
what	
I	
have	V
to	
more	
focus	V
on	
in	
school	
.	

I	
am	V
looking	V
forward	
to	
hearing	V
from	
you	
soon	
and	
have	V
a	
nice	
day	
.	

Thank	V
you

I

have	V
a

to	
go	V
over	
the	
payment	
methodology

Scott

would

This

This	
section	
pertains	V
to	
terminated	
employees	
who	
are	V
paid	V
out	
in	
the	
year	
following	
the	
termination	
event	
.	

The	
way	V
the	
tax	
law	
works	V
,	
the	
tax	
basis	
for	
your	
share	
distribution	V
will	
be	V
based	V
on	
the	
closing	
stock	
price	V
the	
day	
preceding	V
notification	V
to	
the	
transfer	
agent	
.	

As	
such	
,	
we	
will	
distribute	V
net	
shares	V
calculating	V
the	
proper	
withholding	V
at	
fair	
market	
value	
the	
day	
prior	
to	
notifying	V
the	
transfer	
agent	
.	

We	
will	
be	V
distributing	V
the	
shares	V
reflected	V
on	
your	
9/30/01	
statement	V
(	
6,606	
shares	V
plus	
cash	
for	
fractional	
shares	V
)	
.	

If	
you	
would	
prefer	V
to	
settle	V
the	
taxes	
with	
a	
personal	
check	
,	
we	
can	
distribute	V
gross	
shares	V
.	

Please	
let	V
me	
know	V
you	
preference	V
.	

As	
you	
know	V
,	
we	
are	V
in	
the	
process	V
of	
transferring	V
recordkeeping	
services	V
from	
NTRC	
to	
Hewitt	
.	

As	
such	
,	
we	
have	V
a	
CPA	
,	
Larry	
Lewis	
,	
working	V
with	
us	
to	
audit	V
and	
set	V
up	
transition	
files	
.	

He	
has	V
become	V
our	
department	
expert	
on	
the	
PSA	
account	V
(	
much	
more	
knowledgeable	
than	
myself	
)	
and	
the	
various	
plan	
provision	
amendments	V
.	

If	
you	
would	
like	V
,	
we	
can	
set	V
up	
a	
conference	
call	V
with	
you	
,	
myself	
,	
and	
Larry	
to	
go	V
over	
the	
payment	
methodology

Please	
let	V

a

time	
that	
is	V
convenient	V
for	
you

Thanks	V

Thank	V
you	
for	
digging	V
in	
to	
the	
issue	V
of	
Deferred	V
Phantom	
Stock	
Units	
.	

It	
is	V
clear	V
that	
the	
payment	V
will	
be	V
made	V
in	
shares	V
.	

However	
,	
I	
still	
do	V
n't	
understand	V
which	
date	
will	
be	V
used	V
to	
determine	V
the	
value	
and	
calculate	V
how	
many	
shares	V
.	

The	
plan	
document	
under	
VII	
.	

Amount	
of	
Benefit	
Payments	
reads	V
"	
The	
value	
of	
the	
shares	V
,	
and	
resulting	V
payment	
amount	
will	
be	V
based	V
on	
the	
closing	
price	V
of	
Enron	
Corp.	
common	
stock	
on	
the	
January	
1	
before	
the	
date	
of	
payment	V
,	
and	
such	
payment	V
shall	
be	V
made	V
in	
shares	V
of	
Enron	
Corp.	
common	
stock	
.	
"	

Can	
you	
help	V
me	
interpret	V
this	
statement	V
and	
work	V
through	
the	
numbers	
on	
my	
account

Let	V
me	
know	V
when	
you	
get	V
the	
quotes	V
from	
Pauline	
.	

I	
am	V
expecting	V
to	
pay	V
something	
in	
the	
$	
3,	
to	
$	
5,000	
range	
.	

I	
would	
like	V
to	
see	V
the	
quotes	V
and	
a	
description	V
of	
the	
work	V
to	
be	V
done	V
.	

It	
is	V
my	
understanding	V
that	
some	
rock	
will	
be	V
removed	V
and	
replaced	V
with	
siding	
.	

If	
they	
are	V
getting	V
quotes	V
to	
put	V
up	
new	
rock	
then	
we	
will	
need	V
to	
clarify	V
.	

Jacques	
is	V
ready	V
to	
drop	V
in	
a	
dollar	
amount	
on	
the	
release	V
.	

If	
the	
negotiations	V
stall	V
,	
it	
seems	V
like	
I	
need	V
to	
go	V
ahead	
and	
cut	V
off	
the	
utilities	
.	

Hopefully	
things	
will	
go	V
smoothly

The

spoke	V

to	
let	V

that

I

Is	V

The

looks	V

This

He

cats	
react	V
to

they

they

Later	
on	
I	
red	V

that	
it	
's	V
seakness	
.	

I	
was	V
ashamed	
to	
be	V
in	
friendship	
with	
girls	
...	
until	
I	
undrstood	V
that	
it	
's	V
not

women	
wearing	V

is	V

have	V
wife

executives	
are	V
among	
the	
masses	
that

a

It	
is	V
easy	V
to	
get	V
discount	
airfare	
for	
them	
since	
they	
travel	V
very	
frequently	
.	

Cheap	
air	
tickets

Corporate	

Some	
of	
the	
corporate	
also	
get	V
cheap

tickets	
because	
they	
tie	V
up	
with	
some	
of	
the	
airlines	
for	
a	
certain	
period	
based	
on	
the	
discount	V
and	
services	V
they	
get	V
from	
the	
airlines

Corporate	
plans	V
are	V
clubbed	V
with

through	
some	
agencies	
to	
provide	V
better

Promotional

Several	
years	
ago	
I	
developed	V
a	
short	
paper	
and	
pencil	
screening	
test	V
which	
,	
in	
a	
small	
pilot	
study	V
,	
discriminated	V
between	
ADHD	
,	
LD	
,	
and	
control	
subjects	
.	

I	
recently	
converted	V
this	
test	V
to	
an	
online	
test	V
in	
order	
to	
norm	V
it	
to	
a	
larger	
population	V
and	
,	
subsequently	
,	
to	
make	V
it	
available	V
to	
any	
one	
who	
has	V
access	V
to	
a	
computer	
and	
the	
Internet	
.	

The	
test	V
itself	
is	V
what	
is	V
called	V
a	
substitution	
test	V
.	

It	
has	V
two	
parts	
,	
both	
of	
which	
are	V
timed	V
for	
90	
seconds	
each	
and	
the	
differential	
between	
the	
resulting	V
two	
scores	V
determines	V
the	
likelihood	
of	
having	V
a	
learning	
disability	
or	
attention	
deficit	
disorder	
.	

I	
am	V
in	
need	V
of	
test	
subjects	
and	
hope	V
you	
will	
take	V
it	
.	

The	
test	V
,	
along	
with	
an	
information	
form	
,	
is	V
available	V
at	
:	
.	

I	
think	V
a	
test	V
like	
this	
one	
is	V
much	
needed	V
.	

A	
person	
can	
take	V
it	
directly	
instead	
of	
others	
completing	V
behavioral	
checklists	
or	
a	
completing	V
a	
lengthy	
program	
intensive	
test	V
like	
TOVA	
.	

Perhaps	
you	
are	V
willing	V
to	
recommend	V
this	
site	
and	
,	
if	
you	
have	V
a	
website	
,	
place	V
a

on	
your

are	V
there	
any	
sadists	
out	
there	
who	
share	V
the	
same	
tastes	V
as	
i	
do	V
?	

i	
do	V
nt	
know	V
what	
it	
is	V
,	
but	
since	
a	
very	
young	
age	
i	
have	V
had	V
a	
strange	
but	
very	
gratifying	
urge	V
to	
torture	V
or	
maime	V
animals	
.	

i	
am	V
deadly	
serious	V
,	
i	
really	
do	V
get	V
sexual	
releif	
from	
even	
hearing	V
of	
torture	V
of	
animals	
,	
now	
some	
people	
may	
call	V
me	
a	
brute	
or	
a	
coward	
but	
i	
ca	
nt	
help	V
my	
true	
feelings	V
.	

badger	
baiting	V
is	V
natrually	
a	
huge	
turn	V
on	
,	
so	
i	
thought	V
a	
few	
words	
in	
this	
group	
might	
uncover	V
some	
mutual	
enthusiasts	
.	

sincere	
appologies	
to	
anyone	
who	
is	V
offended	V
by	
my	
request	V
but	
my	
request	V
is	V
genuine	V

Once	
upon	
a	
time	
(	
in	
2001	
,	
to	
be	V
specific	
)	
,	
the	
Coca	
-	
Cola	
corporation	
built	V
a	
bottling	
plant	
in	
a	
small	
and	
remote	
Indian	
village	
in	
the	
state	
of	
Kerala	
.	

In	
exchange	V
for	
sucking	V
vast	
amounts	
of	
water	
out	
of	
the	
local	
land	
,	
the	
mighty	
corporation	
promised	V
to	
bring	V
the	
people	
great	
wealth	
.	

But	
within	
a	
few	
short	
months	
,	
the	
village	
people	
began	V
to	
notice	V
their	
wells	
were	V
running	V
dry	
,	
so	
they	
complained	V
to	
the	
corporation	
.	

Coca	
-	
Cola	
calmed	V
the	
concerns	V
of	
the	
people	
and	
attempted	V
to	
win	V
back	
their	
favor	
by	
giving	V
them	
vast	
amounts	
of	
free	
fertilizer	
,	
saying	V
it	
would	
grow	V
bountiful	
crops	
beyond	
their	
wildest	
dreams	V
.	

After	
several	
years	
of	
use	V
,	
we	
arrive	V
at	
the	
present	
day	
when	
the	
village	
people	
have	V
suddenly	
discovered	V
the	
fertilizer	
is	V
actually	
the	
bottling	
plant	
's	
waste	
sludge	
and	
is	V
laden	
with	
cadmium	
,	
a	
highly	
toxic	
,	
cancer	
-	
causing	
heavy	
metal	
.	

The	
village	
soil	
and	
water	
are	V
now	
too	
heavily	
contaminated	V
to	
safely	
occupy	V
human	
life	
,	
so	
the

The	
Greater	
New

Fair	
Housing	
Action	
Center	
(	
GNOFHAC	
)	
filed	V
a	
housing	
discrimination	V
complaint	V
against	
the	
Housing	
Authority	
of	
New	
Orleans	
(	
HANO	
)	
last	
week	
.	

The	
complaint	V
,	
filed	V
with	
the	
United	
States	
Department	
of	
Housing	
and	
Urban	
Development	
,	
accuses	V
HANO	
of	
violating	V
a	
2003	
enforcement	
agreement	V
entered	V
into	
between	
former	
St.	
Thomas

during	
the	
HOPE	
VI	
redevelopment	
of	
St.	
Thomas	
,	
now	
known	V
as	
River	
Garden

The	
current	
complaints	V
allege	V
that	
HANO	
has	V
not	
provided	V
qualified	
former	
St.	
Thomas	
residents	
a	
preference	V
with	
respect	V
to	
available	
public	
housing	V
units	
at	
River	
Garden	
per	
the	
2003	
agreement	V
.	

Upon	
return	V
to	
New	
Orleans	
after	
the	
Hurricane	
Katrina	
evacuation	V
,	
former	
residents	
have	V
been	V
informed	V
that	
there	
are	V
no	
available	
public	
housing	V
units	
at	
River	
Garden	
because	
those	
units	
have	V
been	V
reserved	V
for	
HANO	
employees	
.	

Therefore	
,	
public	
housing	V
residents	
have	V
been	V
unable	V
to	
secure	V
the	
units	
for	
which	
they	
qualified	V
prior	
to	
the	
storm	
and	
are	V
left	V
homeless	V
,	
as	
a	
result	
.	

"	
In	
the	
wake	
of	
Hurricane	
Katrina	
,	
affordable	
housing	V
in	
New

is	V
more	
scarce	V
than	
ever

As	
such

it	
is	V

that

NASA

which	
only	
leaves	V
it	
with

Outsourcing	V
these

a

the

(

On	
3

,	
NASA	
administrator

told	V
the

house

that

about	
$	
500

project	
over	
five

"	
That

on

Palestinian

Cloaking	V

Abbas	
pledged	V
to	
fulfill	V
Palestinian	
dreams	V
of

It

that	
the	
Palestinian	
leadership	V
(	
upcoming	
)	
will	
not	
be	V
a	
peace	
partner	
with	
Israel	
.	

He	
is	V
already	
demanding	V
claims	V
that	
Israel	
said	V
no	
to	
not	
only	
the	
world	
,	
but	
to	
Arafat	
himself	
.	

Listing	V
his	
priorities	
,	
Abbas	
told	V
supporters	
of	
the	
ruling	
Fatah	
party	
that	
he	
was	V
determined	V
to	
provide	V
security	
to	
his	
people	
and	
continue	V
the	
struggle	V
against	
Israel	
's	
partially	
completed	
West

barrier	
.	

Abbas	
also	
pledged	V
to	
resolve	V
the	
problem	
of	
millions	
of	
Palestinian	
refugees	
and	
their	
descendants	
.	

Abbas	
,	
a	
refugee	
himself	
from	
what	
is	V
today	
the	
northern	
Israeli	
city	
of	
Safed	
,	
called	V
the	
refugee	
issue	V
"	
very	
important	V
and	
very	
dangerous	V
.	
"	

Having	V
personally	
visited	V
the	
West	
Bank	
and	
Israel	
,	
I	
can	
say	V
that	
this	
new	
political	
voice	V
is	V
threatening	V
to	
collapse	V
the	
peace	
process	V
.	

If	
Abbas	
does	V
not	
change	V
his	
former	
thinking	V
and	
continues	V
the	
path	
of	
Yasser	
Arafat	
,	
then	
there	
will	
not	
be	V
peace	V
in	
the	
Holy	
Land	
and	
the	
Palestinians	
will	
ultimately	
suffer	V

(

The	
Palestinian	
militant	
organisation	
Hamas	
has	V
announced	V
an	
end	V
to	
rocket	
attacks	V
on	
Israel	
from	
the	
Gaza	
Strip	
after	
a	
weekend	
of	
escalating	
violence	
.	

Up	
to	
40	
rockets	
had	V
been	V
fired	V
at	
Israel	
,	
weeks	
after	
its	
military	
withdrew	V
from	
the	
territory	
.	

In	
response	V
to	
the	
rockets	
,	
Israel	
resumed	V
its	
policy	
of	
targeting	V
militant	
leaders	
in	
air	
strikes	V
.	

Authorised	V
by	
Ariel	
Sharon	
to	
make	V
"	
unrestricted	
"	
strikes	V
,	
its	
military	
launched	V
new	
missile	
attacks	V
overnight	
.	

It	
looks	V
as	
if	
Hamas	
has	V
thrown	V
in	
the	
towel	
for	
this	
round	V
,	
unable	V
to	
take	V
the	
beating	V
the	
Israeli	
Defense	
Forces	
have	V
unleashed	V
upon	
this	
terrorist	
group	
.	

Mahmoud	
Zahar	
,	
Hamas	
's	
leader	
declared	V
the	
cease	
fire	V
after	
Israel	
killed	V
it's	
former	
leader	
,	
Muhammed	
Sheikh	
Khalil	
.	

Hamas	
has	V
become	V
rather	
unpopular	
in	
Gaza	
,	
as	
many	
see	V
the	
Israeli	
air	
strikes	V
as	
a	
response	V
towards	
the	
rocket	
attacks	V
upon	
Israeli	
soil	
.	

Egypt	
had	V
a	
role	
to	
play	V
as	
they	
convinced	V
Hamas	
to	
end	V
the	
attacks	V
,	
although	
the	
same	
can	
not	
be	V
said	V
of	
Islamic	
Jihad	
.	

(	
Jerusalem	
Post	
)	

"	
We	
're	V
not	
happy	V
with	
Hamas

at	
this

in

the	
Israeli	
escalation	V
against	
the	
Palestinians	
,	
"	
commented	V
Khader	
Habib	
,	
a	
senior	
Islamic	
Jihad	
official	
.	

"	
But	
it	
seems	V
that	
Hamas	
has	V
its	
own	
political	
agenda	
.	
"	

[	
...	
]	

"	
The	
problem	
is	V
not	
with	
the	
Palestinian	
resistance	
groups	
but	
with	
Israel	
's	
scheme	
to	
destroy	V
the	
Palestinians	
'	
infrastructure	
,	
"	
Habib	
said	V
.	

"	
Hamas	
remains	V
targeted	V
by	
Israel	
,	
as	
in	
the	
past	
,	
and	
the	
Israeli	
occupation	V
does	V
not	
need	V
excuses	V
to	
pursue	V
its	
aggression	V
.	

Israel	
wants	V
to	
drive	V
the	
Palestinians	
toward	
civil	
war	V
.	
"	

Islamic	
Jihad	
has	V
refused	V
to	
recognized	V
the	
cease	
fire	V
,	
and	
hopes	V
to	
turn	V
the	
Gaza	
strip	
"	
into	
a	
vast	
battlefield	
.	
"	

Unless	
President	
Mahmoud	
Abbas	
steps	V
in	
,	
Gaza	
will	
probably	
look	V
like	
a	
battle	
field	
by	
the	
time	
Israel	
is	V
done	V
reminding	V
Hamas	
of	
their	
critical	
error	V
,	
although	
currently	
the	
only	
thing	
Abbas	
is	V
doing	V
is	V
lashing	V
out	
and	
refusing	V
to	
take	V
responsibility	
for	
his	
inability	
to	
act	V

If

n't	
you	
phone	V
another

I	
do	V
n't	
think	V
they	
ban	V
if	
the	
tats	
are	V
n't	
offensive	V
and	
you	
should	
make	V
them	
not

at

People	
are	V

I	
have	V
a	
male

cockatiel

and	
there	
are	V
2	
eggs	
in	
the	
bottom

cage

will	
they	
hatch	V

Most	
likely	
not

if	
there	
is	V
not	
a	
bird	
sitting	V
on	
the

This	
is	V
hard	V
to	
tell	V

Cockatiels	
can	
lay	V
unfertilized	
eggs	
as	
well

Just	
because	
you	
have	V
a	
male	
and

,	
it	
can	
not	
be	V
guaranteed	V
the	
two	
mated	V

You	
can	
try	V
picking	V
up	
the	
eggs	
and	
holding	V
it	
up	
against	
a	
very	
bright	
light	
.	

If	
you	
see	V
a	
dark	
spot	
in	
the	
egg	
,	
that	
means	V
it	
is	V
fertilized	
and	
will

if

a

What	
is	V
your	
cat	
s	
name	
and	
why	
did	V
you	
name	V
him	
/	
her	
that	
?	

If	
you	
HAVE	V
a	
cat	
of	
course

My	
cat	
s	
name	
is	V
Twinky	
.	

When	
she	
was	V
a	
tiny	
little	
kitten	
she	
looked	V
like	
those	
twinky	
snack	
cakes	
.	

She	
is	V
a	
creme	
tabby	
and	
I	
've	V
had	V
her	
for	
over	
2	
years	
now	
.	

I	
have	V
a	
siamese	
lynx	
name	V
Star	
we	
called	V
her	
that	
because	
she	
has	V
a	
star	
pattern	
on	
her	
face	
.	

And	
she	
is	V
the	
STAR	
of	
the	
family	
.	

I	
love	V
her	
.	
:)	

I	
have	V
a	
Norwegian	
Forest	
Cat	
that	
is	V
named	V
Achilles	
bc	
as	
a	
kitten	
he	
always	
attacked	V
your	
feet	
when	
you	
walked	V
by	
!	

My	
cat	
s	V
Called	V
Frank	
because	
the	
year	
we	
got	V
him	
was	V
the	
year	
Frank	
Sinatra	
died	V

He	
also	
had	V
bright	
blue	
eyes	
like	
Frank	
Sinatra	
did	V
:)	

what	
does	V
it	
mean	V
when	
a	
veiled	
chameleon	
egg	
is	V
soft	V
?	

my	
female	
chameleon	
just	
laid	V
eggs	
yesterday	
and	
today	
some	
of	
the	
eggs	
are	V
soft	V
when	
i	
mean	V
soft	
i	
mean	V
like	
not	
like	
ordinary	
chameleon	
eggs	
.	

They	
are	V
probably	
infertile	
.	

If	
there	
is	V
no	
male	
they	
are	V
probably	
infertile	
!	

If	
you	
take	V
a	
flash	
light	
and	
shine	V
it	
through	
the	
eggs	
and	
you	
see	V
nothing	
throw	V
them	
away	
!	

If	
you	
do	V
not	
they	
will	
start	V
to	
rot	V
!	

If	
she	
has	V
no	
male	
to	
fertilize	V
the	
eggs	
,	
the	
eggs	
will	
aways	
be	V
infertile	
.	

if	
you	
do	V
have	V
a	
male	
but	
they	
are	V
not	
in	
the	
same	
cage	
or	
breeding	V
but	
you	
touch	V
him	
then	
her	
she	
will	
smell	V
his	
sent	
and	
probably	
lay	V
eggs	
.	

Hope	V
she	
stops	V
laying	V
eggs	
because	
she	
will	
get	V
really	
skinny	
!	

If	
she	
continues	V
!	

Hope	V
this	
helps	V

Is	V
it	
better	V
to	
book	V
a	
cruise	
online

by	
a	
travel	
agent	
?	

First	
time	
to	
go	V
on	
A	
cruise	
any	
and	
all	
info	
is	V
appreciated	V

Personally	
,	
I	
do	V
n't	
find	V
a	
travel	
agent	
to	
be	V
of	
value	
to	
me	
as	
I	
am	V
willing	V
to	
put	V
in	
the	
time	
doing	V
research	V
on	
the	
internet	
.	

I	
have	V
not	
had	V
good	
experience	V
with	
travel	
agents	
.	

They	
do	V
n't	
seem	V
to	
know	V
anything	
but	
the	
hype	
they	
are	V
told	V
and	
the	
packages	
they	
have	V
available	V
to	
them	
.	

The	
one	
time	
I	
actually	
booked	V
through	
a	
travel	
agent	
I	
did	V
not	
get	V
all	
of	
the	
amenities	
I	
had	V
paid	V
for	
.	

The	
few	
times	
I	
have	V
consulted	V
with	
a	
travel	
agent	
I	
was	V
able	V
to	
find	V
the	
same	
for	
less	
on	
my	
own	
,	
and	
more	
options	
than	
what	
they	
were	V
selling	V
.	

So	
now	
I	
do	V
not	
bother	V
with	
them	
at	
all

best	
is	V
using	V
an	
online

My

okay

I	
have	V
a	
dog	
and	
my	
mother	
is	V
really	
really	
terrified	V
of	
hamsters	
.	

Well	
last	
night	
while	
I	
was	V
sleeping	V
,	
my	
hamster	
escaped	V
from	
his	
cage	
.	

He	
is	V
in	
my	
room	
,	
but	
there	
are	V
so	
many	
things	
inside	
there	
,	
I	
du	V
n	
no	V
what	
to	
do	V
.	

I	
have	V
lots	
of	
containers	
in	
there	
.	

Anybody	
give	V
me	
ideas	
like	
a	
trap	
or	
something	
?	

Find	V
him	
before	
he	
finds	V
the	
dog	
food	
.	

I	
'm	V
not	
kidding	V
,	
I	
once	
lost	V
a	
hamster	
in	
my	
house	
3	
months	
later	
I	
walk	V
down	
in	
the	
basement	
and	
it	
was	V
as	
big	V
as	
a	
rat	
.	

It	
had	V
been	V
eating	V
dog	
food	
the	
whole	
time	
.	

It	
was	V
huge	V
and	
scared	V
the	
crap	
out	
of	
me	
.	

Make	V
sure	V
he	
is	V
n't	
trapped	V
somewhere	
&	
put	V
a	
bowl	
of	
food	
out	
.	

He	
will	
come	V
and	
eat	V

Start	V
cleaning	V

start	V
looking	V

can	
i	
have	V
some	
indoor	
pet	
ideas	
please	
!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	

i	
want	V
a	
small	
indoor	
pet	
that	
my	
mother	
will	
let	V
me	
have	V
please	
help	V

i	
want	V
something	
cheap	
east	
to	
take	V
care	V
of	
and	
something	
to	
hopefully	
fit	V
in	
my	
room	

no	
pet	
is	V
really	
easy	V
to	
take	V
care	V
of	
.	

they	
all	
need	V
love	V
and	
attn	
,	
food	
,	
proper	
surroundings	
etc	
.	

the	
easiest	
thing	
would	
be	V
a	
fish	
-	
but	
u	
need	V
to	
clean	V
the	
tank	
weekly	
,	
feed	V
it	
the	
right	
amt	
,	
etc	
etc	
x	

Having	V
a	
pet	
is	V
n't	
easy	V
.	

You	
should	
treat	V
all	
pets	
like	
children	
.	

They	
require	V
a	
lot	
of	
attention	V
or	
they	
get	V
fussy	
and	
tear	V
stuff	
up	
.	

If	
you	
want	V
easy	
then	
go	V
with	
a	
gold	
fish	
or	
hamster	
.	

I	
would	
go	V
with	
a	
small	
rodent	
such	
as	
a	
mouse	
,	
rat	
,	
hamster	
or	
gerbil	
if	
you	
want	V
something	
you	
can	
handle	V
and	
hold	V
.	

Fish	
are	V
probably	
the	
easiest	
to	
take	V
care	V
of	
though

french	
male	
sensuality	
?	

I	
ve	V
been	V
dating	V
a	
man	
from	
brittany	
france	
for	
a	
couple	
of	
months	
now	
.	

He	
's	V
been	V
away	
for	
a	
week	
and	
I	
was	V
thinking	V
of	
waiting	V
for	
him	
in	
his	
apartment	
wearing	V
only	
his	
dress	
shirt	
.	

It	
s	V
still	
a	
fairly	
new	
relationship	V
and	
we	
have	V
nt	
had	V
sex	V
yet	
so	
it	
s	V
kind

a	
big	
deal	V
.	

I	
just	
do	V
nt	
want	V
to	
freak	V
him

him

french

French	
women

the	
way	V
we	
say	V
it	
is	V
not	
usually	
as	
straigthforward	
as	
you	
propose	V
to	
do	V
.	

Why	
not	
wait	V
for	
him	
in	
a	
sexy	
dress	
with	
lunch	
or	
dinner	
,	
or	
a	
light	
snack	
at	
his	
house

And	
you	
take	V
it	
up	
from	
there

Just	
make	V

that	
it	
is	V

food	
is	V
mediocre	
at	
best	
.	

the	
waitress	
took	V
my	
name	
and	
then	
called	V
me	
that	
all	
night	
.	

not	
sure	
how	
I	
feel	V
about	
that	
one	
.	

it	
's	V
passable	
as	
a	
pub	
,	
but	
the	
pizza	
is	V
not	
that	
great	V
.	

if	
you	
want	V
good	
pizza	
,	
go	V
to	
famoso	
.	

seriously	
.	

Anyone	
else	
find	V
it	
a	
little	
suspicious	
that	
there	
are	V
not	
only	
20	
reviews	V
for	
this	
dentist	
(	
a	
HUGE	
number	
compared	
to	
the	
others	
in	
the	
area	
)	
,	
but	
that	
they	
all	
have	V
the	
same	
unique	
grammar	
structure	
?	

And	
they	
seem	V
to	
be	V
posted	V
at	
fairly	
regular	
intervals	
?	

Best	
YET	
!	

We	
go	V
to	
Japaneiro	
's	
all	
the	
time	
and	
we	
have	V
NEVER	
been	V
disappointed	V
!	

Wait	
staff	
is	V
always	
ready	V
to	
help	V
if	
you	
ca	
n't	
decide	V
(	
which	
happens	V
every	
time	
for	
me	
d	
/	
t	
the	
huge	
menu	
of	
rolls	V
)	
and	
always	
courteous	
!	

Soooo	
tasty	
!	

Good	
honest	
wrok	

Harlan	
provides	V
great	
service	V
.	

He	
is	V
very	
knowledgeable	V
and	
took	V
the	
time	
to	
explain	V
the	
repairs	V
to	
me	
.	

The	
work	V
on	
my	
car	
was	V
done	V
quickly	
and	
I	
felt	V
I	
could	
trust	V
his	
work	V
.	

I	
have	V
nothing	
but	
fantastic	
things	
to	
say	V
.	

I	
highly	
recommend	V
his	
shop	
.	

Best	
in	
Memphis	

This	
shop	
is	V
by	
far	
the	
best	
I	
have	V
been	V
to	
.	

I	
have	V
a	
Saab	
...	
which	
everything	
is	V
expensive	V
on	
and	
they	
have	V
been	V
extrememly	
fair	V
and	
price	V
a	
lot	
lower	
than	
any	
other	
shop	
I	
called	V
.	

They	
are	V
the	
only	
place	
I	
would	
take	V
my	
car	
peiod	
.	

Took	V
a	
laptop	
in	
for	
a	
video	
cable	
to	
be	V
replaced	V
.	

Everything	
except	
the	
display	
worked	V
fine	
before	
I	
took	V
it	
in	
.	

The	
video	
cable	
was	V
replaced	V
and	
suddenly	
the	
motherboard	
was	V
dead	
.	

Phone	
calls	V
were	V
n't	
returned	V
when	
promised	V
and	
the	
botched	V
repair	V
took	V
a	
week	
longer	
than	
promised	V
.	

We	
have	V
stayed	V
at	
Tanglewood	
for	
many	
years	
now	
.	

We	
go	V
over	
about	
5	
times	
a	
year	
.	

We	
have	V
never	
had	V
a	
problem	
with	
the	
cabins	
.	

They	
are	V
always	
so	
helpful	V
.	

The	
cabins	
have	V
always	
been	V
clean	V
.	

Helen	
is	V
a	
wonderful	
place	
to	
take	V
you	
family	
.	

We	
recommend	V
these	
cabins	
!	

Ca	
n't	
say	V
enough	

I	
used	V
to	
tan	V
down	
the	
street	
before	
I	
was	V
referred	V
to	
this	
place	
by	
one	
of	
my	
friends	
.	

WOW	
!	

I	
did	V
n't	
know	V
what	
I	
was	V
missing	V
.	

The	
lowest	
bed	
here	
is	V
better	V
than	
my	
last	
salon	
s	
highest	
level	
.	

Salon	
is	V
clean	V
and	
girls	
are	V
nice	V
.	

Great	
People	
and	
even	
better	
service	V
!	

Best	
to	
deal	V
with	
!	

In	
a	
few	
words	
...	
I	
'm	V
pleasantly	
surprised	V
that	
you	
can	
still	
find	V
"	
old	
school	
"	
service	V
out	
there	
where	
company	
care	V
more	
about	
good	
name	
and	
customers	
than	
their	
pockets	
...	

Highly	
recommended	
people	
/	
business	
.	

Thanks	V
Josh	
!	

Dentist	
you	
can	
trust	V

If	
possible	
I	
try	V
the	
services	V
on	
myself	
before	
I	
bring	V
in	
my	
son	
.	

Drs.	
Ali	
work	V
wonders	V
.	

Neither	
me	
nor	
my	
son	
have	V
n't	
had	V
a	
single	
cavity	
since	
we	
started	V
dental	
care	V
there	
.	

The	
team	
focus	
is	V
prevention	V
and	
education	V
.	

That	
alone	
makes	V
them	
unique	V
.	

This	
is	V
not	
your	
usual	
cheap	
hotdog	
place	
.	

They	
offer	V
a	
large	
variety	
of	
quality	
hotdogs	
and	
hamburgers	
They	
also	
offer	V
veggie	
dogs	
.	

The	
fries	
are	V
of	
good	
quality	
,	
the	
staff	
is	V
friendly	V
.	

The	
atmosphere	
is	V
your	
typical	
indie	
outfit	
with	
old	
movie	
posters	
and	
memorabilia	
from	
the	
70's	
and	
80's	
.	

Over	
charged	V
.	

I	
used	V
my	
card	
to	
purchase	V
a	
meal	
on	
the	
menu	
and	
the	
total	
on	
my	
receipt	
was	V
$	
8.95	
but	
when	
I	
went	V
on	
line	
to	
check	V
my	
transaction	V
it	
show	V
$	
10.74	
.	

There	
is	V
something	
wrong	
or	
maybe	
the	
individual	
made	V
a	
mistake	V
but	
to	
me	
that	
is	V
not	
integrity	
.	

Elmira	
,	
you	
r	V
the	
best	
!	

All	
I	
can	
say	V
is	V
that	
Elmira	
you	
are	V
the	
best	
I	
ve	V
experienced	V
,	
never	
before	
has	V
the	
seamstress	
done	V
a	
perfect	
job	
until	
i	
met	V
you	
.	

I	
recommend	V
you	
to	
everyone	
in	
Calgary	
,	
as	
she	
is	V
a	
professional	
and	
the	
cost	
for	
her	
was	V
low	V
.	

5	
star	
detail	
job	

I	
took	V
my	
Mustang	
here	
and	
it	
looked	V
amazing	V
after	
they	
were	V
done	V
,	
they	
did	V
a	
great	
job	
,	
I	
'm	V
very	
satisfied	
with	
the	
results	
.	

The	
paint	
and	
wheels	
looked	V
like	
glass	
and	
the	
interior	
looked	V
new	V
!	

Also	
,	
they	
have	V
great	
customer	
service	V
and	
a	
very	
knowledgeable	
staff
