John

me

an

up	
a	
few

However

this

is	V
really	
bad	
news

On	
the	
other	
hand

it	
looks	V
pretty	
cool	V

Iran	
says	V
it	
is	V
creating	V
nuclear	
energy	
without	
wanting	V
nuclear	
weapons	
.	

The	
United	
States	
does	V
n't	
believe	V
the	
Iranian	
Government	
.	

One	
can	
suspect	V
the	
Iranian	
Government	
.	

But	
there	
is	V
no	
proof	V
.	

I	
read	V
an	
Article	
in	
Time	
magazine	
accusing	V
the	
Iranian	
Government	
of	
being	V
willing	V
to	
start	V
a	
nuclear	
war	V
and	
I	
sympathise	V
with	
the	
Article	
.	

They	
are	V
certainly	
being	V
nasty	V
to	
the	
United	
Nations	
Security	
Council	
in	
connection	V
with	
the	
anti-proliferation	
treaty	
.	

The	
President	
has	V
also	
said	V
he	
would	
like	V
to	
see	V
Israel	
wiped	V
off	
the	
map	
which	
he	
could	
n't	
even	
begin	V
to	
try	V
without	
nuclear	
weapons	
.	

But	
he	
has	V
insisted	V
that	
he	
wants	V
nuclear	
power	
for	
peaceful	
purposes	
.	

Many	
people	
want	V
to	
use	V
diplomacy	
with	
Iran	
rather	
than	
military	
pressure	
.	

But	
will	
diplomacy	
work	V
?	

And	
can	
anyone	
use	V
military	
pressure	
without	
proof	V
?	

One	
reader	
pointed	V
out	
that	
the	
President	
watched	V
the	
Americans	
in	
the	
embassy	
when	
they	
took	V
them	
hostage	
.	

He	
has	V
denied	V
this	
.	

We	
do	V
n't	
have	V
to	
believe	V
him	
.	

But	
we	
ca	
n't	
prove	V
it

It	
does	V
seem	V
that	
Iranians	
frequently	
make	V
statements	V
and	
then	
hide	V
behind	
lack	V
of	
proof	V

Angry	
crowds

anti-American	
slogans

It

The	
clerics	
demanded	V
talks	V
with

commanders

Falluja	
has	V
long	
been	V
roiled	V
by	
tense	
relations	V
with	
the	
US	
soldiers	
there

since

Sunnis	
either	
remain	V
committed	V
to	
Arab	
nationalism

have	V
become	V
Sunni	
fundamentalists

radicals

Cities	
such

Falluja	
received	V
special	
treatment	V
from	
Saddam

enjoyed	V
a	
disproportionate	
share	V
of	
the	
country	
's	
wealth

power

They	
know	V
that

American	
advent

should	
be	V
constitutionally

)	
has	V
pushed	V
Sudan	
not	
just	
off	
the	
front	
pages	
,	
or	
the	
A	
section	
,	
but	
out	
of	
the	
NY	
Times	
and	
Washington	
Post	
completely	
.	

I	
had	V
to	
go	V
to	
the	
BBC	
for	
this	
report	V
.	

It	
's	V
symptomatic	V
,	
I	
suppose	V
,	
of	
our	
fast	
-	
paced	
,	
24	
hour	
news	
-	
cycle	
lives	
,	
that	
the	
biggest	
short	
-	
term	
humanitarian	
crisis	
in	
the	
world	
would	
quickly	
be	V
eclipsed	V
,	
once	
our	
Secretary	
of	
State	
was	V
finished	V
with	
his	
whirlwind	
tour	V
,	
from	
the	
newspapers	
.	

It	
's	V
just	
disappointing	V
.	

Most	
troubling	
,	
however	
,	
is	V
the	
fact	
that	
the	
political	
will	
to	
end	V
the	
crisis	
expressed	V
a	
few	
short	
weeks	
ago	
seems	V
to	
have	V
ebbed	V
.	

At	
that	
time	
,	
UN	
Secretary	
General	
Kofi	
Annan	
demanded	V
steps	V
be	V
taken	V
to	
end	V
the	
ethnic	
violence	
in	
Darfur	
within	
48	
hours	
.	

Two	
weeks	
later	
,	
and	
the	
violence	
continues	V
.	

The	
African	
Union	
is	V
clearly	
not	
up	
to	
the	
task	V
of	
keeping	V
the	
peace	V
,	
pledging	V
300	
troops	
to	
an	
area	
that	
will	
need	V
15,000	
,	
according	
to	
analysts	
.	

And	
international	
donors	
have	V
given	V
only	
half	
of	
the	
relief	
aid	V
that	
Darfur	
needs	V
,	
according	
to	
the	
local	
UN	
officials	
.	

So	
hear	
we	
are	V
,	
two	
weeks	
later	
,	
after	
that	
dazzling	
PR	
display	V
two	
weeks	
ago	
by	
Powell	
and	
Annan	
,	
and	
the	
situation	
on	
the	
ground	
in	
Darfur	
appears	V
basically	
unchanged	V
.	

Warren	
Buffett	
is	V
giving	V
away	
85	
%	
of	
his	
wealth	
,	
mostly	
to	
the	
Bill	
and	
Melinda	
Gates	
Foundation	
.	

It	
's	V
a	
move	V
that	
really	
worries	V
me	
;	
Buffett	
's	
usual	
justification	V
for	
keeping	V
most	
of	
his	
money	
was	V
that	
he	
was	V
still	
compounding	V
the	
value	
of	
his	
fortune	
at	
a	
pretty	
high	
rate	
,	
so	
any	
gifts	
now	
would	
mean	V
significantly	
less	
money	
for	
the	
foundation	
later	
.	

It	
's	V
a	
little	
hard	V
to	
parse	V
,	
but	
at	
this	
point	
his	
ostensible	
view	V
is	V
that	
the	
Gateses	
are	V
very	
good	
money	
-	
redistributors	
,	
and	
he	
wants	V
them	
to	
have	V
the	
money	
as	
soon	
as	
possible	
.	

Which	
essentially	
sounds	V
like	
he	
's	V
worried	V
that	
Bill	
or	
Melinda	
are	V
going	V
to	
die	V
soon	
.	

I	
assume	V
his	
actual	
reason	
is	V
that	
he	
's	V
worried	V
that	
Berkshire	
Hathaway	
just	
ca	
n't	
grow	V
quickly	
enough	
to	
justify	V
his	
usual	
charity	
policy	
.	

I	
'm	V
not	
sure	V
how	
the	
market	
will	
react	V
.	

It	
does	V
n't	
change	V
the	
company	
's	
intrinsic	
worth	
,	
and	
as	
the	
article	
notes	V
,	
the	
company	
might	
be	V
added	V
to	
a	
major	
index	
once	
the	
shares	V
get	V
more	
liquid	
.	

On	
the	
other	
hand	
,	
this	
is	V
essentially	
a	
statement	V
that	
the	
company	
is	V
overpriced	
from	
the	
guy	
who	
knows	V
it	
best	
--	
and	
happens	V
to	
be	V
the	
best	
investor	
of	
the	
last	
century	
.	

em	
...	
no	
...	
the	
Gates	
foundation	
mainly	
invests	V
in	
medical	
research	V
and	
education	V
,	
that	
means	V
donating	V
now	
adds	V
a	
tremendous	
value	
compared	
to	
donating	V
in	
ten	
years	
.	

Because	
the	
10.000.000	
people	
dying	V
from	
malaria	
will	
otherwise	
be	V
dead	
.	

i.e	
.	

He	
's	V
not	
giving	V
85	
%	
away	
,	
he	
's	V
giving	V
a	
number	
of	
shares	V
each	
year	
that	
decrease	V
in	
number	
at	
the	
rate	
of	
5	
%	
a	
year	
(	
until	
gone	
?	
)	
.	

He	
mentions	V
his	
wife	
's	
death	V
having	V
an	
effect	V
on	
him	
.	

It	
sounds	V
pretty	
rational	V
that	
he	
's	V
saying	V
that	
Bill	
and	
Melinda	
are	V
at	
a	
prime	
spot	
,	
so	
starting	V
the	
money	
hose	
now	
is	V
a	
good	
idea	
,	
but	
Buffet	
is	V
still	
keeping	V
most	
of	
his	
donation	V
inside	
of	
Berkshire	
where	
it	
will	
compound	V
.	

Bill	
over	
at	
The	
Fourth	
Rail	
has	V
an	
excellent	
essay	
on	
how	
the	
MSM	
and	
the	
UN	
,	
even	
the	
leftist	
countries	
in	
Europe	
,	
are	V
basically	
accepting	V
terrorist	
organizations	
as	
legitimate	
forms	
of	
a	
political	
party	
:	

On	
the	
same	
day	
Palestinians	
protest	V

of	
Hezbollah

Syria

the	
terrorist

Hamas

has	V
indicated	V
it	
is	V
time	
to	
"	
recognize	V
Hezbollah	
"	
after	
easily	
being	V
duped	V
by	
"	
the	
message	
on	
the	
placards	
they	
are	V
using	V
"	
.	

This	
acceptance	V
of	
blatantly	
terrorist	
groups	
as	
legitimate	
freedom	
movements	V
is	V
a	
cancerous	
tumor	
on	
the	
United	
Nations	
and	
the	
media	
.	

Over	
three	
years	
after	
9-11	
,	
the	
United	
Nations	
,	
despite	
their	
attempts	V
to	
project	V
strength	
in	
fighting	V
terrorism	
,	
still	
can	
not	
properly	
define	V
the	
word	
"	
terrorist	
"	
,	
waffling	V
over	
the	
issue	V
of	
whether	
the	
murder	V
of	
innocent	
civilians	
are	V
terrorist	
acts	
.	

The	
media	
routinely	
obscures	V
the	
lines	
between	
terrorism	
and	
legitimate	
resistance	V
,	
as	
the	
recent	
article	
by	
Daniel	
Okrent	
of	
The	
New	
York	
Times	
demonstrates	V
.	

...	

The	
decision	V
to	
sidestep	V
the	
obvious	
to	
satisfy	V
the	
need	V
to	
avoid	V
confrontation	V
does	V
not	
bring	V
peace	V
,	
but	
only	
delays	V
the	
eventual	
conflict	V
as	
the	
predators	
of	
Hamas	
and	
Hezbollah	
exploit	V
the	
inherent	
weakness	
of	
the	
internationals	
and	
the	
media	
.	

I	
've	V
been	V
fuming	V
over	
this	
fact	
for	
a	
few	
weeks	
now	
,	
ever	
since	
some	
organizations	
and	
governments	
suggested	V
we	
need	V
to	
accept	V
the	
fact	
that	
Hezbollah	
will	
get	V
involved	V
in	
running	V
Lebanon	
.	

Wtf	
is	V
this	
?	

This	
is	V
a	
terrorist	
organization	
plain	V
and	
simple	V
.	

This	
is	V
the	
organization	
that	
bombed	V
our	
Marine	
barracks	
in	
1983	
,	
took	V
Americans	
hostage	
throughout	
the	
80's	
and	
now	
they	
should	
be	V
considered	V
a	
legitimate	
organization	
?	

This	
is	V
just	
another	
reason	
to	
never	
trust	V
the	
MSM	
,	
and	
certainly	
not	
the	
Europeans	
.	

The	
Iraqi	
Islamic	
Party	
lead	V
by	
Muhsin	
Abdul	
Hamid	
,	
has	V
been	V
among	
the	
few	
Sunni	
Muslim	
groups	
willing	
to	
cooperate	V
(	
even	
if	
rather	
lukewarmly	
)	
with	
the	
Americans	
.	

It	
is	V
now	
threatening	V
to	
pull	V
out	
of	
the	
Allawi	
caretaker	
government	
.	

The	
IIP	
had	V
also	
been	V
the	
main	
force	
urging	V
Sunni	
Arabs	
to	
participate	V
in	
the	
elections	V
scheduled	V
for	
January	
,	
and	
had	V
been	V
opposed	V
in	
this	
stance	V
by	
the	
Association	
of	
Muslim	
Scholars	
.	

That	
the	
Iraqi	
Islamic	
Party	
is	V
now	
contemplating	V
leaving	V
the	
Allawi	
government	
raises	V
the	
question	V
of	
whether	
a	
mass	
Sunni	
Arab	
boycott	V
of	
the	
elections	V
is	V
in	
the	
offing	
,	
thus	
fatally	
weakening	V
the	
legitimacy	
of	
any	
new	
government	
.	

Az

The	
Association	
of	
Muslim	
Scholars	
forbade	V
Iraqis	
to	
participate	V
in	
the	
attack	V
on	
Fallujah	
with	
the	
Americans	
.	

In	
a	
communique

the	
AMS	
said	V
that	
for	
Iraqis	
to	
take	V
part	
with	
"	
raiding	V
forces	
"	
in	
the	
assault	V
on	
a	
city	
,	
the	
population	V
of	
which	
is	V
Muslim	
(	
such	
as	
Fallujah	
)	
would	
be	V
considered	V
the	
most	
mortal	
of	
mortal	
sins	
.	

The	
Sunni	
AMS	
told	V
Iraqis	
,	
"	
You	
sinned	V
when	
you	
participated	V
with	
occupation	
forces	
in	
the	
assault	V

and	
beware	V
lest	
you

this	
same	
sin	
in	
Fallujah	
.	

Remember	V
that	
the	
Occupation	V
is	V
emphemeral	
.	
"	

The	
radical	
Shiite	
Sadr	
movement	V
issued	V
a	
statement	V
forbidding	V
the	
participation	V
of	
Iraqi	
troops	
in	
the	
attack	V
on	
Fallujah	
,	
as	
well	
.	

The	
statement	V
said	V
,	
"	
We	
direct	V
an	
appeal	V
at	
the	
men	
in	
the	
Iraqi	
forces	
,	
whether	
national	
guards	
or	
others	
,	
the	
majority	
of	
whom	
are	V
Muslim	
,	
calling	V
upon	
them	
to	
refrain	V
for	
commiting	V
this	
enormous	
sin	
under	
the	
banner	
of	
forces	
that	
do	V
not	
respect	V
our	
religion	
or	
any	
principles	
of	
basic	
humanity	
,	
and	
we	
ask	V
them	
to	
view	V
this	
war	V
as	
illegal	
.	
"	

It	
called	V
a	
"	
ploy	
"	
the	
assertaion	V
that	
the	
attack	V
was	V
merely	
on	
foreign	
fighters	
at	
Fallujah	
.	

The	
convergence	V
of	
views	V
among	
the	
more	
militant	
Sunni	
Muslim	
clerics	
of	
AMS	
and	
the	
radical	
Shiites	
of	
the	
Sadr	
movement	V
has	V
been	V
seen	V
before	
,	
last	
spring	
during	
the	
initial	
US	
assault	V
on	
Fallujah	
and	
during	
the	
US	
attack	V
on	
Mahdi	
Army	
militiamen	
in	
Najaf	
.	

Most	
Shiites	
,	
however	
,	
are	V
still	
reluctant	V
to	
take	V
major	
risks	V
to	
support	V
the	
Sunnis	
of	
Fallujah	
,	
many	
of	
whom	
had	V
supported	V
Saddam	
and	
his	
anti-Shiite	
pogroms

President	
Bush	
pinched	V
a	
few	
nerves	
yesterday	
with	
his	
choice	V
of	
words	
:	

WASHINGTON	
(	
Reuters	
)	
-	

U.S.	
Muslim	
groups	
criticized	
President	
Bush	
on	
Thursday	
for	
calling	V
a	
foiled	V
plot	V
to	
blow	V
up	
airplanes	
part	
of	
a	
"	
war	V
with	
Islamic	
fascists	
,	
"	
saying	V
the	
term	
could	
inflame	V
anti-Muslim	
tensions	V
.	

U.S.	
officials	
have	V
said	V
the	
plot	V
,	
thwarted	V
by	
Britain	
,	
to	
blow	V
up	
several	
aircraft	
over	
the	
Atlantic	
bore	V
many	
of	
the	
hallmarks	
of	
al

.	

"	
We	
believe	V
this	
is	V
an	
ill	
-	
advised	V
term	
and	
we	
believe	V
that	
it	
is	V
counterproductive	V
to

Islam

Muslims	
with	
fascism

Nihad	
Awad

executive	
director	
of

Islamic

is	V
why	
he

we

war	V

people

We	
're	V
at	
war	V
with	
Islamic	
fascists

By	
using	V
the

adjective	
Bush	
was	V
purposely	
not

We	
've	V

a	
Steven

the	
one	
word	
that	
did	V

crash	V
my	
spell

it	
being	V
followed	V
by

Folks	
,	
if	
it	
's	V
Islamic	
,	
and	
fascist	
,	
it	
's	V
an	
Islamic	
fascist	
.	

But	
because	
we	
do	V
n't	
want	V
to	
sound	V
hateful	
we	
must	
pretend	V
everyone	
's	V
a	
possible	
suspect	
and	
make	V
airline	
travel	V
more	
miserable	V
than	
it	
's	V
ever	
been	V
.	

On	
the	
internet	
site	
of	
Monotheism	
and	
Holy	
War	
(	
al	
-	
Tawhid	
wa	
al	
-	
Jihad	
)	
,	
the	
group	
allegedly	
declared	V
,	
"	
We	
announce	V
that	
the	
Tawhid	
and	
Jihad	
Group	
,	
its	
prince	
and	
soldiers	
,	
have	V
pledged	V
allegiance	
to	
the	
sheikh	
of	
the	
mujahideen	
Osama	
bin	
Laden	
.	
"	

This	
pledge	
is	V
a	
new	
development	V
.	

Abu	
Musab	
al	
-	
Zarqawi	
and	
his	
group	
are	V
said	V
to	
have	V
been	V
bitter	
rivals	
of	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
during	
the	
Afghan	
resistance	
days	
.	

One	
witness	
at	
the	
Moutasaddiq	
trial	V
in	
Germany	
alleged	V
that	
Zarqawi	
had	V
not	
allowed	V
Monotheism	
and	
Holy	
War	
to	
share	V
resources	
with	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
in	
the	
early	
zeroes	
of	
the	
21st	
century	
.	

If	
the	
statement	V
is	V
true	V
,	
it	
is	V
a	
worrying	
sign	V
that	
even	
the	
divided	
small	
radical	
guerrilla	
groups	
are	V
being	V
"	
picked	V
up	
"	
by	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
.	

This	
consolidation	V
is	V
obviously	
a	
result	
of	
Bush	
's	
aggressive	
invasion	V
of	
Iraq	
and	
of	
the	
botching	V
of	
the	
aftermath	
.	

It	
is	V
a	
setback	
for	
the	
war	V
on	
terror	
.	

Al	
-	
Qaeda	
in	
Afghanistan	
was	V
a	
group	
of	
only	
a	
few	
hundred	
"	
Afghan	
Arabs	
"	
who	
pledged	V
personal	
loyalty	
to	
Usamah	
Bin	
Laden	
.	

It	
could	
notionally	
be	V
expanded	V
to	
encompass	V
the	
5,000	
-	
strong	
"	
55th	
Brigade	
"	
of	
the	
Taliban	
regime	
,	
though	
this	
is	V
not	
the	
technical	
definition	V
.	

Because	
Usamah	
is	V
Saudi	
,	
my	
guess	V
is	V
that	
they	
were	V
especially	
influenced	V
by	
an	
extremist	
form	
of	
the	
Wahhabi	
school	
of	
Islam	
that	
predominates	V
among	
Saudia	
's	
some	
15	
million	
citizens	
.	

In	
1998	
they	
were	V
joined	V
by	
Egyptians	
from	
the	
al	
-	
Jihad	
al	
-	
Islami	
group	
of	
Ayman	
al	
-	
Zawahiri	
(	
many	
of	
these	
were	V
from	
Upper	
Egypt	
,	
especially	
Asyut	
and	
environs	
)	
.	

After	
that	
point	
,	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
was	V
a	
joint	
enterprise	
between	
the	
Egyptian	
extremists	
and	
the	
polyglot	
Arabs	
around	
Bin	
Laden	
,	
only	
some	
of	
whom	
were	V
Saudi	
.	

Zarqawi	
is	V
a	
Jordanian	
,	
and	
his	
Monotheism	
and	
Holy	
War	
group	
in	
Afghanistan	
probably	
had	V
a	
distinctive	
coloration	V
as	
mainly	
Jordanian	
,	
Palestinian	
and	
Syrian	
.	

They	
also	
had	V
a	
special	
connection	V
to	
some	
extremists	
in	
Jordan	
and	
Germany	
.	

They	
are	V
probably	
especially	
oriented	V
toward	
the	
Salafi	
school	
of	
modern	
Islamic	
thought	V
,	
which	
has	V
a	
Protestant	
-	
like	
emphasis	V
on	
going	V
back	
to	
the	
original	
practice	
of	
the	
early	
companions	
of	
the	
Prophet	
Muhammad	
.	

(	
Most	
Salafis	
are	V
not	
militant	
or	
violent	V
,	
though	
they	
tend	V
to	
be	V
rather	
narrow	
-	
minded	
in	
my	
experience	V
,	
on	
the	
order	
of	
Protestant	
Pietists	
)	
.	

Monotheism	
and	
Holy	
War	
obviously	
does	V
have	V
a	
violent	
interpretation	V
of	
Salafism	
,	
rather	
as	
the	
the	
leaders	
of	
the	
so	
-	
called	
German	
Peasant	
Rebellion	
among	
early	
Protestants	
did	V
.	

Another	
worrisome	
sign	V
is	V
that	
local	
Iraqi	
Sunni	
fundamentalists	
opposed	V
to	
the	
US	
presence	
in	
Iraq	
have	V
begun	V
joining	V
Monotheism	
and	
Holy	
War	
,	
and	
wearing	V
its	
distinctive	
orange	
and	
black	
insignia	
.	

These	
have	V
been	V
sighted	V
among	
Iraqi	
crowds	
on	
Haifa	
Street	
in	
Baghdad	
and	
in	
Samarra	
.	

So	
now	
there	
are	V
hundreds	
of	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
members	
in	
Iraq	
where	
there	
had	V
been	V
none	
before	
.	

The	
consolidation	V
of	
smaller	
local	
radical	
fundamentalist	
groups	
with	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
can	
also	
be	V
seen	V
in	
the	
case	V
of	
the	
Fizazi	
group	
in	
Tangiers	
that	
morphed	V
into	
the	
Moroccan	
Islamic	
Combatant	
Group	
,	
had	V
members	
who	
met	V
with	
September	
11	
ringleader	
Muhammad	
Atta	
,	
and	
ultimately	
was	V
in	
part	
responsible	V
for	
the	
Madrid	
train	
bombings	V
.	

The	
September	
11	
Panel	
will	
issue	V
its	
findings	V
on	
Thursday	
.	

It	
notes	V
10	
points	
at	
which	
the	
US	
made	V
key	
mistakes	V
that	
might	
have	V
stopped	V
Bin	
Laden	
's	
plot	V
.	

Four	
of	
these	
were	V
under	
Clinton	
and	
6	
under	
Bush	
.	

Bush	
came	V
out	
today	
and	
said	V
that	
if	
he	
had	V
known	V
what	
was	V
coming	V
,	
he	
would	
have	V
expended	V
every	
effort	V
to	
stop	V
it	
,	
and	
that	
so	
would	
have	V
Clinton	
.	

This	
statement	V
is	V
,	
despite	
its	
facade	
of	
fair	
-	
mindedness	
,	
so	
many	
weasel	
words	
.	

Of	
course	
Bush	
would	
have	V
tried	V
to	
stop	V
9/11	
if	
he	
had	V
known	V
it	
was	V
coming	V
.	

The	
question	V
is	V
,	
"	
Should	
he	
have	V
known	V
it	
was	V
coming	V
?	
"	

The	
answer	V
is	V
,	
"	
Yes	
!	
"	

We	
now	
know	V
that	
Bush	
and	
his	
administration	V
came	V
into	
office	
obsessed	V
with	
Iraq	
.	

Cheney	
was	V
looking	V
at	
maps	
of	
Iraq	
oil	
fields	
and	
muttering	V
about	
opportunities	
for	
US	
companies	
there	
,	
already	
in	
January	
or	
February	
of	
2001	
.	

Wolfowitz	
contradicted	V
counter-terrorism	
czar	
Richard	
Clarke	
when	
the	
latter	
spoke	V
of	
the	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
threat	
,	
insisting	V
that	
the	
preeminent	
threat	
of	
terrorism	
against	
the	
US	
came	V
from	
Iraq	
,	
and	
indicating	V
he	
accepted	V
Laurie	
Mylroie	
's	
crackpot	
conspiracy	
theory	
that	
Saddam	
was	V
behind	
the	
1993	
World	
Trade	
Towers	
bombing	V
.	

If	
you	
believe	V
crackpot	
theories	
instead	
of	
focusing	V
on	
the	
reality	
--	
that	
was	V
an	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
operation	V
mainly	
carried	V
out	
by	
al	
-	
Gamaa	
al	
-	
Islamiyyah	
,	
an	
Egyptian	
terrorist	
component	
allied	V
with	
Bin	
Laden	
--	
then	
you	
will	
concentrate	V
on	
the	
wrong	
threat	
.	

Even	
after	
the	
attacks	V
on	
September	
11	
,	
Bush	
was	V
obsessing	V
about	
Iraq	
.	

Wolfowitz	
lied	V
to	
him	
and	
said	V
that	
there	
was	V
a	
10	
to	
50	
%	
chance	V
that	
Iraq	
was	V
behind	
them	
.	

(	
On	
what	
evidence	
?	

The	
hijackers	
were	V
obviously	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
,	
and	
no	
operational	
links	
between	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
and	
Iraq	
had	V
ever	
been	V
found	V
)	
.	

Rumsfeld	
initially	
rejected	V
an	
attack	V
on	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
bases	
in	
Afghanistan	
,	
saying	V
there	
were	V
"	
no	
good	
targets	
"	
in	
Afghanistan	
.	

(	
What	
about	
40	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
bases	
that	
had	V
trained	V
the	
9/11	
hijackers	
and	
other	
terrorists	
gunning	V
for	
the	
United	
States	
??	
)	

The	
Pentagon	
did	V
not	
even	
have	V
a	
plan	V
for	
dealing	V
with	
Afghanistan	
or	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
that	
it	
could	
pull	V
off	
the	
shelf	
,	
according	
to	
Bob	
Woodward	
.	

Bush	
did	V
not	
have	V
his	
eye	
on	
the	
ball	
.	

Neither	
did	
Cheney	
,	
Rumsfeld	
,	
or	
Wolfowitz	
.	

They	
were	V
playing	V
Captain	
Ahab	
to	
Saddam	
's	
great	
white	
whale	
.	

Imperial	
Hubris	
makes	V
the	
case	V
that	
lots	
of	
people	
in	
the	
CIA	
and	
counter-terrorism	
divisions	
elsewhere	
in	
the	
US	
government	
knew	V
all	
about	
Bin	
Laden	
and	
the	
threat	
he	
posed	V
.	

They	
were	V
from	
all	
accounts	V
marginalized	V
and	
not	
listened	V
to	
.	

Bush	
demoted	V
Dick	
Clarke	
,	
among	
the	
most	
vocal	
and	
focused	
of	
the	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
experts	
,	
from	
his	
cabinet	
.	

Dick	
could	
never	
thereafter	
get	V
any	
real	
cooperation	V
from	
the	
cabinet	
officers	
,	
who	
outranked	V
him	
,	
and	
he	
could	
not	
convince	V
them	
to	
go	V
to	
battle	
stations	
in	
the	
summer	
of	
2001	
when	
George	
Tenet	
's	
hair	
was	V
"	
on	
fire	V
"	
about	
the	
excited	
chatter	
the	
CIA	
was	V
picking	V
up	
from	
radical	
Islamist	
terrorists	
.	

As	
for	
the	
Clinton	
administration	V
,	
let	V
me	
say	V
one	
thing	
in	
its	
defense	V
.	

Clinton	
had	V
worked	V
out	
a	
deal	V
with	
Pakistani	
Prime	
Minister	
Nawaz	
Sharif	
in	
summer	
of	
1999	
that	
would	
have	V
allowed	V
the	
US	
to	
send	V
a	
Special	
Ops	
team	
in	
after	
Bin	
Laden	
in	
Qandahar	
,	
based	V
from	
Pakistan	
.	

I	
presume	V
you	
need	V
the	
Pakistan	
base	
for	
rescue	
operations	V
in	
case	
anything	
went	V
wrong	V
.	

You	
also	
need	V
Pakistani	
air	
space	
.	

The	
plan	V
was	V
all	
set	V
and	
could	
have	V
succeeded	V
.	

But	
in	
fall	
of	
1999	
,	
Gen.	
Pervez	
Musharraf	
made	V
a	
coup	V
against	
Nawaz	
Sharif	
.	

The	
Pakistani	
army	
was	V
rife	V
with	
elements	
protective	
of	
the	
Taliban	
,	
and	
the	
new	
military	
government	
reneged	V
on	
the	
deal	V
.	

Musharraf	
told	V
Clinton	
he	
could	
n't	
use	V
Pakistani	
soil	
or	
air	
space	
to	
send	V
the	
team	
in	
against	
Bin	
Laden	
.	

Look	V
at	
a	
map	
and	
you	
try	V
to	
figure	V
out	
how	
,	
in	
fall	
of	
1999	
,	
you	
could	
possibly	
pull	V
off	
such	
an	
operation	V
without	
Pakistani	
facilities	
.	

Of	
course	
,	
you	
could	
just	
go	V
in	
by	
main	
force	
.	

But	
for	
those	
of	
you	
tempted	V
in	
that	
direction	
,	
please	
look	V
up	
Carter	
's	
Tabas	
operation	V
.	

It	
should	
be	V
easily	
googled	V
.	

Clinton	
tried	V
,	
and	
tried	V
hard	
.	

The	
gods	
were	V
n't	
with	
us	
on	
that	
one	
.	

that	
is	V
how	
i	
want	V
you	
to	
refer	V
to	
me	
as	
"	
the	
king	
"	

i	
do	V
n't	
think	V
so	
.	

i	
'm	V
the	
king	

yeah	

sounds	V
exciting	V

want	V
to	
go	V

someplace	
that	
is	V
like

i	
was	V
thinking	V
somewhere	
like	
mcdonald	
's

that	
may	
be	V
too	
nice	V
though

what	
do	V
you

John	
,	

Hello	
from	
South	
America	
.	

I	
just	
got	V
your	
email	V
and	
I	
certainly	
concur	V
with	
Jeff	
making	V
the	
call	V
.	

He	
has	V
maintained	V
a	
good	
relationship	V
with	
Mulva	
.	

This	
was	V
a	
risk	V
that	
we	
had	V
but	
we	
did	V
have	V
assurances	V
from	
Phillips	
regarding	
performance	V
.	

I	
do	V
n't	
know	V
how	
much	
it	
will	
help	V
however	
.	

Richard	
Harper	
and	
Mary	
Nell	
Browning	
may	
have	V
some	
ideas	
here	
but	
I	
am	V
sure	V
you	
've	V
already	
gone	V
through	
it	
with	
them	
.	

I	
am	V
amazed	V
how	
the	
details	
get	V
fuzzy	V
on	
an	
old	
project	
.	

When	
you	
discussed	V
it	
,	
i	
was	V
trying	V
to	
think	V
back	
to	
our	
remedies	
and	
discussions	V
but	
the	
3	
years	
have	V
made	V
it	
difficult	V
.	

I	
do	V
n't	
know	V
if	
there	
is	V
anything	
I	
can	
do	V
but	
I	
'm	V
always	
willing	V
to	
help	V

Good

I

I

too

I	
'll	
search	V
him	
out

see	V
if	
I	
can	
set	V
it	
up

we

i	
need	V

the

the

the

n't	
go	V

Since

gone	V

I	
am	V

Vince

We	
are	V
still	
trying	V
to	
work	V
the	
PSE	
swap	
transaction	V
,	
now	
that	
the	
forex	
desk	
has	V
been	V
able	V
to	
find	V
a	
fix	V
for	
CPI	
in	
the	
market	
.	

Further	
to	
my	
voicemail	
,	
our	
colleagues	
in	
credit	V
are	V
calculating	V
the	
reserve	
on	
the	
PSE	
swap	
.	

They	
are	V
currently	
using	V
9.5	
%	
fixed	V
based	
on	
the	
1	
year	
implied	V
volatility	
.	

Volatility	
of	
USD	
/	
DM	
has	V
been	V
in	
the	
range	
of	
between	
7	
%	
and	
11	
%	
.	

Can	
one	
of	
your	
research	
staff	
justify	V
a	
suitable	
20	
year	
volalatility	
number	
for	
USD	
/	
Euro	
.	

Ideally	
,	
we	
would	
like	V
a	
fast	
turnaround	
.	

In	
addition	V
,	
is	V
there	
someone	
who	
could	
consider	V
the	
correlation	V
between	
US	
CPI	
and	
the	
$	
/	
euro	
exchange	
rate	
.	

The	
credit	
guys	
are	V
currently	
assuming	V
that	
there	
is	V
no	
correlation	V
and	
may	
consequently	
be	V
double	
dipping	V
the	
credit	
reserve	
on	
this	
basis	
too	
.	

Grateful	
for	
any	
help	V
or	
suggestions	V
you	
could	
provide	V

Sid	

Vincent

I	
enjoyed	V
your

Daren	
,	

I	
was	V
wondering	V
if	
it	
would	
be	V
OK	
for	
me	
to	
sit	V
in	
with	
you	
one	
day	
to	
get	V
a	
general	
feel	
of	
your	
end	
of	
the	
process	V
.	

Pat	
had	V
told	V
me	
before	
he	
left	V
that	
it	
would	
help	V
me	
better	
grasp	V
the	
process	V
as	
a	
whole	
.	

I	
understand	V
the	
imminent	
cold	
weather	
is	V
making	V
things	
crazy	V
,	
so	
now	
may	
not	
be	V
the	
best	
time	
to	
be	V
in	
your	
way	V
.	

But	
let	V
me	
know	V
if	
I	
can	
spend	V
a	
day	
,	
morning	
,	
or	
even	
just	
an	
afternoon	
down	
there	
with	
you	
whenever	
it	
is	V
a	
good	
time	
.	

I	
think	V
it	
will	
help	V
me	
very	
much	
in	
my	
role

it

We

The	
Dow	
topped	V
out	
in	
February	
of	
1966	
at	
995	
.	

By	
September	
of	
that	
year	
the	
Dow	
had	V
tumbled	V
to	
744	
.	

The	
Dow	
then	
rallied	V
to	
a	
high	
of	
943	
in	
September	
of	
'67	
.	

By	
March	
of	
'68	
the	
Dow	
had	V
fallen	V
to	
825	
,	
only	
to	
climb	V
to	
a	
highly	
speculative	
peak	
of	
985	
in	
December	
of	
'68	
.	

The	
Dow	
then	
sank	V
to	
631	
in	
December	
of	
'70	
.	

By	
April	
of	
'71	
the	
Dow	
had	V
climbed	V
back	
to	
950	
,	
only	
to	
fall	V
to	
869	
in	
February	
of	
'72	
.	

A	
big	
rally	V
then	
took	V
the	
Dow	
(	
unconfirmed	
)	
to	
a	
record	
high	
of	
1051	
in	
January	
of	
'73	
,	
turning	V
everyone	
bullish	
.	

But	
by	
December	
of	
'73	
the	
Dow	
had	V
collapsed	V
to	
788	
.	

Think	V
that	
was	V
bad	V
-	
by	
December	
of	
'74	
the	
Dow	
had	V
sunk	V
to	
a	
bear	
market	
low	
of	
577	
.	

At	
that	
time	
,	
the	
gurus	
and	
geniuses	
of	
Wall	
Street	
were	V
predicting	V
a	
250	
Dow	
and	
many	
were	V
talking	V
openly	
about	
the	
end	V
of	
capitalism	
.	

Of	
course	
,	
that	
was	V
the	
bottom	

And	
that	
's	V
the	
way	V
the	
greatest	
bear	
market	
since	
the	
Depression	
worked	V
its	
way	V
down	
.	

By	
late	
1974	
investors	
were	V
dizzy	V
,	
they	
were	V
desperate	V
,	
they	
were	V
wrung	V
-	
out	
,	
they	
had	V
left	V
Wall	
Street	
,	
many	
for	
good	
.	

great	
,	
we	
look	V
forward	
to	
seeing	V
you

The	
results	
of	
the	
February	
26th	
PVT	
test	V
conducted	V
on	
Nville	
have	V
been	V
discussed	V
with	
each	
of	
you	
over	
the	
last	
three	
months	
.	

As	
we	
have	V
discussed	V
....	
effective	V
Sep	
13th	
,	
Anita	
will	
make	V
the	
adjustments	V
to	
Enron	
's	
inventory	
and	
pad	
gas	
to	
reflect	V
the	
February	
26th	
results	
.	

I	
talked	V
with	
Gary	
Wilson	
,	
and	
he	
confirmed	V
that	
the	
revised	
values	
are	V
correct	V
.	

Attached	V
is	V
a	
spreadsheet	
that	
contains	V
the	
values	
.	

The	
correction	V
to	
the	
working	
gas	
includes	V
TWO	
corrections	V
.	

The	
results	
of	
the	
February	
26th	
test	V
reduces	V
the	
working	
gas	
by	
398,487	
MMBTU	
.	

In	
addition	V
,	
there	
is	V
a	
reduction	V
of	
22,101	
MMBTU	
which	
is	V
the	
difference	V
between	
the	
SCADA	
values	
(	
Best	
Available	
)	
that	
Anita	
showed	V
on	
the	
February	
29th	
Storage	
Sheet	
and	
the	
"	
official	
"	
February	
29th	
values	
that	
Gary	
Wilson	
received	V
from	
MIPS	
.	

To	
summarize	V
:	
Enron	
's	
pad	
gas	
will	
now	
be	V
3,993,310	
MMBTU	
,	
instead	
of

MMBTU	
.	

Enron	
's	
working	
gas	
will	
be	V
reduced	V
by	
420,588	
MMBTU

there

Attached	V
are	V
clean

of	
the

guaranties	V

"	
PPA	
"	
)	
and	
Green	
Premium	
Sharing	
Agreement	
(	
"

.?	

The	
guaranty	
for	
the	
PPA	
is	V
blacklined	V
against	
the	
Enron	
EPC	
Contract	
guaranty	
in	
favor	
of	
the	
banks	
which	
was	V
granted	V
in	
connection	V
with	
our	
Cabazon	
Wind	
Power	
Project	
(	
the	
project	
most	
recently

by	
EWC	
)	
and	
the	
GPSA	
guaranty	
is	V
blacklined	V
against	
the	
PPA	
guaranty	
.	

As	
we	
discussed	V
last	
week	
,	
since	
the	
Enron	
guaranties	
will	
need	V
to	
be	V
in	
a	
form

will	
acceptable	V
to	
our

we

with	
a

in	
our

financing	V
and	
that	
was	V
negotiated	V
by	
Enron

.	

We	
plan	V
to	
use	V
the

that	
will

Your

I	
hope	V

that	
you

remain	V
involved	V
at	
some	
level

The	
design	V

its	
potential	
economics	
could	
be	V
key	V
to	
how	
worthy	
the

Enron	
could

an

environment

which	
to	
the	
concept	
enhancement

commercialization	V
could	
be	V
successfully	
accomplished	V

Please

thought	V

Hello	
there	

Action	
Network	
is	V
a	
BBC	
website	
for	
people	
who	
are	V
taking	V
action	V
on	
issues	V
that	
concern	V
them	
.	

I	
'm	V
getting	V
in	
touch	V
because	
I	
think	V
it	
could	
be	V
useful	V
to	
people	
campaigning	V
about	
hospital	
closures	
.	

We	
've	V
got	V
a	
page	
dedicated	V
to	
issues	V
around	
hospitals	
(	
http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/C55153	
)	
and	
a	
group	
called	V
NHS	
SOS	
have	V
already	
put	V
up	
a	
campaign	V
about	
ward	
closures	
in	
Cumbria	
.	

I	
'm	V
hoping	V
to	
build	V
this	
up	
to	
be	V
a	
hub	
for	
all	
the	
campaigners	
-	
a	
place	
where	
people	
can	
exchange	V
ideas	
and	
advice	
.	

It	
would	
be	V
great	V
if	
the	
person	
from	
CHANT	
who	
started	V
this	
page	
would	
put	V
up	
a	
short	
description	V
of	
the	
campaign	V
and	
a	
list	
to	
this	
group	
page	
on	
the	
Action	
Network	
site	
.	

Action	
Network	
is	V
also	
a	
good	
place	
to	
post	V
details	
of	
events	
,	
or	
try	V
to	
rally	V
together	
a	
group	
if	
you	
want	V
to	
take	V
action	V
in	
your	
area	
.	

You	
can	
attach	V
anything	
you	
write	V
to	
pages	
for	
your	
local	
area	
,	
as	
well	
as	
to	
the	
'	
issue	
'	
pages	
.	

I	
'm	V
more	V
than	
happy	
to	
help	V
people	
with	
the	
site	
or	
answer	V
any	
questions	V
about	
Action	
Network	
-	
just	
drop	V
me	
a	
message	
.	

Otherwise	
,	
hope	V
to	
see	V
you	
there	
!	

Kind	
regards	V

Winston	
Peters	
is	V
visiting	V
a	
school	
.	

In	
one	
class	
,	
he	
asks	V
the	
students	
if	
anyone	
can	
give	V
him	
an	
example	
of	
a	
"	
tragedy	
"	
.	

One	
little	
boy	
stands	V
up	
and	
offers	V
that	
,	
"	
if	
my	
best	
friend	
who	
lives	V
next	
door	
was	V
playing	V
in	
the	
street	
when	
a	
car	
came	V
along	
and	
killed	V
him	
,	
that	
would	
be	V
a	
tragedy	
"	
.	

"	
No	
,	
"	
Winston	
says	V
,	
"	
That	
would	
be	V
an	
ACCIDENT	
.	
"	

A	
girl	
raises	V
her	
hand	
.	

"	
If	
a	
school	
bus	
carrying	V
fifty	
children	
drove	V
off	
a	
cliff	
,	
killing	V
everyone	
involved	
...	
that	
would	
be	V
a	
tragedy	
"	
.	

"	
I	
'm	V
afraid	V
not	
,	
"	
explains	V
Winston	
,	
"	
that	
is	V
what	
we	
would	
call	V
a	
GREAT	
LOSS	V
.	
"	

The	
room	
is	V
silent	
,	
none	
of	
the	
other	
children	
volunteer	V
.	

"	
What	
?	
"	
asks	V
Winston	
,	
"	
is	V
n't	
there	
any	
one	
here	
who	
can	
give	V
me	
an	
example	
of	
a	
tragedy	
?	
"	

Finally	
,	
a	
boy	
in	
the	
back	
raises	V
his	
hand	
.	

In	
a	
timid	
voice	V
,	
he	
says	V
:	
"	
If	
an	
airplane	
carrying	V
Winston	
Peters	
was	V
blown	V
up	
by	
a	
bomb	
,	
THAT	
would	
be	V
a	
tragedy	
"	
.	

"	
Wonderful	
!	
"	
Winston	
beams	V
.	

"	
Marvelous	
!	

And	
can	
you	
tell	V
me	
WHY	
that	
would	
be	V
a	
tragedy	
?	
"	

"	
Well	
,	
"	
says	V
the	
boy	
,	
"	
because	
it	
would	
n't	
be	V
an	
accident	
,	
and	
it	
certainly	
would	
n't	
be	V
a	
great	
loss	V

It

Wise	
decision	V
to	
go	V
through	
the	
private	
sector	
--	
NASA	
's	
budget	
may	
be	V
kinda	
tight	V
to	
fund	V
a	
project	
like	
this	
.	

This	
group	
does	V
sound	V
pretty	
interesting	V
though	
.	

The	
Lunar	
Transporatation	
Systems	
(	
LTS	
)	
is	V
actually	
being	V
funded	V
by	
two	
space	
businessmen	
,	
Walter	
Kistler	
and	
Bob	
Citron	
.	

Both	
of	
these	
men	
are	V
heavily	
involved	V
in	
the	
private	
sector	
of	
the	
space	
industry	
,	
and	
both	
are	V
also	
involved	V
with	
another	
space	
company	
called	V
SPACEHAB	
.	

They	
want	V
to	
use	V
LTS	
to	
tie	V
into	
NASA	
's	
vision	
for	
Space	
Exploration	V
,	
and	
seem	V
pleased	V
that	
the	
White	
House	
is	V
moving	V
in	
that	
direction	
.	

"	
We	
are	V
so	
excited	V
that	
the	
White	
House	
and	
the	
recent	
new	
government	
space	
policy	
underscores	V
the	
need	V
to	
involve	V
the	
private	
sector	
in	
assisting	V
NASA	
develop	V
its	
plans	V
for	
the	
new	
Vision	
for	
Space	
Exploration	V
,	
"	
said	V
Walter	
Kistler	
,	
LTS	
co-founder	
and	
Chairman	
.	

With	
their	
proposal	V
of	
a	
"	
Earth	
-	
Moon	
"	
highway	
,	
it	
looks	V
like	
space	
tourism	
may	
become	V
a	
reality	
sooner	
than	
we	
think	V
.

U.S.	
astronauts	
will	
launch	V
to	
the	
moon	
on	
sleek	
,	
single	
,	
shuttle	
booster	
rockets	
and	
the	
first	
new	
upper	
-	
stage	
rocket	
this	
country	
has	V
developed	V
in	
more	
than	
a	
decade	
,	
NASA	
and	
the	
Pentagon	
have	V
told	V
the	
White	
House	
.	

Lunar	
landers	
and	
other	
gear	
needed	V
for	
extended	
visits	V
to	
the	
moon	
will	
be	V
lofted	V
by	
gargantuan	
launchers	
as	
big	
as	
the	
Apollo	
-	
era	
Saturn	
5	
,	
the	
most	
powerful	
rockets	
ever	
flown	V
.	

It	
looks	V
as	
if	
NASA	
is	V
transitioning	V
away	
from	
the	
shuttle	
model	
,	
as	
in	
the	
past	
they	
have	V
proven	V
to	
be	V
quite	
dangerous	V
as	
Columbia	
has	V
recently	
proved	V
.	

Although	
these	
new	
rockets	
are	V
probably	
more	
expensive	V
,	
they	
will	
be	V
able	V
to	
go	V
at	
a	
much	
greater	
range	
than	
it's	
shuttle	
cousins	
,	
as	
they	
can	
not	
only	
break	V
free	V
from	
the	
atmosphere	
but	
reach	V
the	
moon	
as	
well	
.	

"	
NASA	
will	
initiate	V
development	V
of	
a	
Crew	
Launch	V
Vehicle	
derived	V
from	
space	
shuttle	
solid	
rocket	
boosters	
with	
a	
new	
upper	
stage	
for	
human	
spaceflight	
,	
"	
said	V
the	
letter	
,	
signed	V
by	
NASA	
Administrator	
Mike	
Griffin	
and	
the	
Pentagon	
's	
top	
space	
official	
,	
ex-astronaut	
Ron	
Sega	
...	

"	
NASA	
then	
plans	V
to	
develop	V
a	
new	
100	
-	
metric	
-	
ton	
-	
class	
launch	
vehicle	
derived	V
from	
existing	
capabilities	
with	
the	
space	
shuttle	
external	
tanks	
and	
solid	
rocket	
boosters	
for	
future	
missions	V
to	
the	
moon	
,	
"	
the	
letter	
said	V
.	

NASA	
is	V
planning	V
on	
using	V
these	
new	
shuttles	
to	
replace	V
the	
current	
models	V
,	
with	
industry	
forecasters	
predicting	V
a	
launch	V
as	
early	
as	
2014	
.	

The	
new	
rocket	
design	V
will	
differ	V
slightly	
from	
it's	
predecessors	
,	
in	
the	
fact	
that	
the	
crew	
and	
cargo	
would	
launch	V
separately	
from	
two	
different	
rockets	
each	
and	
join	V
up	
in	
space	
later	
on	
.	

Launching	V
this	
way	V
will	
hopefully	
avoid	V
future	
disasters	
,	
giving	V
more	
support	V
towards	
NASA	
revisiting	V
the	
stars	
.

him	
to	
eat	V
right	
away	
-	
it	
could	
have	V
been	V
you	
missed	V
his	
meal	
time	
and	
he	
needed	V
to	
eat	V
-	
since	
it	
sounds	V
like	
it	
has	V
happened	V
several	
times	
over	
two	
days	
-	
then	
he	
may	
have	V
gotten	V
int	
to	
something	
that	
needs	V
to	
be	V
attended	V
to	
RIGHT	
AWAY	
!!!	

or	
has	V
acquired	V
some	
type	
of	
disease	
and	
that

needs	V

be	V
attended	V
to

why	
are	V
there	
two	
statues	
of	
David	
?	

i	
doing	V
a	
research	
paper	
on	
donatello	
and	
i	
notice	V
that	
there	
are	V
two	
statues	
of	
David	
,	
a	
bronze	
one	
and	
marble	
one	
.	

Michelangelo	
made	V
the	
marble	
one	
but	
why	
did	V
he	
do	V
another	
if	
Donatello	
had	V
already	
made	V
one	
?	

so	
i	
m	V
a	
little	
confused	V
,	
why	
is	V
there	
two	
statues	
of	
David	
?	

different	
generations	
,	
the	
donatello	
is	V
of	
a	
boy	
david	
as	
a	
young	
sheep	
Herder	
,	
the	
Michelangelo	
is	V
the	
grown	
up	
man	
david	
as	
slayer	
and	
king	

Because	
he	
liked	V
making	V
statues	
of	
David	
!	
:D	

Obviously	
,	
he	
should	
have	V
been	V
arrested	V
and	
jailed	V
-	
imagine	V
making	V
a	
statue	
or	
painting	
on	
the	
same	
subject	
as	
another	
artist	
-	
clearly	
insulting	
and	
disrespecting	
-	
wasted	
time	
that	
could	
have	V
been	V
used	V
making	V
a	
statue	
with	
clothes	
on	
.	

Name	
of	
specific	
Hibachi	
restaurant	
in	
Chicago	
?	

I	
have	V
a	
friend	
out	
in	
Chicago	
this	
week	
,	
and	
I	
am	V
trying	V
to	
remember	V
the	
name	
of	
an	
awesome	
hibachi	
style	
restaurant	
i	
visited	V
while	
out	
there	
a	
couple	
years	
ago	
.	

I	
think	V
it	
was	V
in	
the	
Lincoln	
Square	
area	
but	
do	V
n't	
quote	V
me	
on	
that	
.	

It's	
'	
gimmick	
'	
was	V
that	
you	
fill	V
your	
bowl	
cafeteria	
-	
style	
from	
raw	
ingredients	
and	
leave	V
it	
on	
the	
counter	
with	
a	
chopstick	
listing	V
your	
table	
number	
on	
it	
.	

Four	
guys	
around	
a	
large	
square	
open	
hibachi	
cook	V
your	
food	
,	
and	
when	
it	
's	V
finished	V
a	
server	
brings	V
it	
to	
your	
table	
.	

All	
-	
you	
can	
-	
eat	V
style	
deal	V
.	

It	
was	V
pretty	
epic	
as	
I	
remember	V
and	
would	
love	V
to	
send	V
my	
friend	
there	
.	

Any	
help	V
?

What	
's	V
the	
best	
time	
to	
start	V
a	
trip	V
around	
the	
world	
?	

Well	
,	
I	
'm	V
about	
to	
graduate	V
in	
less	
then	
a	
year	
,	
and	
I	
'm	V
planning	V
to	
study	V
medical	
school	
.	

But	
since	
in	
my	
country	
it	
lasts	V
for	
minimum	
6	
years	
,	
and	
I	
want	V
to	
go	V
aground	
the	
world	
,	
what	
do	V
you	
think	V
,	
should	
I	
do	V
it	
before	
or	
after	
medical	
school	
?	

If	
you	
can	
afford	V
to	
go	V
before	
,	
then	
by	
all	
means	
,	
GO	V
.	

If	
you	
have	V
to	
wait	V
,	
due	
to	
financial	
reasons	
,	
then	
wait	V
.	

I	
would	
much	
rather	
put	V
it	
off	
until	
I	
can	
afford	V
to	
have	V
the	
vacation	V
of	
a	
lifetime	
as	
I	
'm	V
sure	V
this	
trip	V
is	V
intended	V
to	
be	V
.	

Airfare	
alone	
will	
be	V
incredibly	
expensive	V
so	
make	V
sure	V
you	
have	V
the	
money	
and	
of	
course	
free	
time	
to	
take	V
your	
time	
and	
have	V
a	
great	
time

My

stops	V
working	V
at	
times	
as	
in	
the	
power	
bottom	
is	V
switched	V
to

but	
the	
camera	
does	V
not	
respond	V

any	
function	V

the

only	
begins	V
to	
work	V
again	
when	
i	
take	V
out	
the	
battery	
and	
put	V
it	
back

did	V
anyone	
have	V
this	
issue	V
?	

is	V
it	
worthy	V
to	
send	V
in	
for	
warranty	
repair	V
?	

thanks	V

Sounds	V
simple	V
enough	V
to	
me	
.	

Your	
camera	
is	V
n't	
acting	V
normally	
,	
you	
got	V
warranty	
,	
let	V
Canon	
deal	V
with	
it

I	
would	
agree	V
.	

I	
shoot	V
a	
t1i	
and	
have	V
n't	
had	V
such	
an	
issue	V
.	

I	
also	
agree	V
it	
's	V
under	
warranty	
so	
get	V
in	
touch	V
with	
Canon	
.	

It	
sounds	V
like	
a	
firmware	
issue	V
and	
the	
camera	
requires	V
a	
re-boot	
just	
like	
what	
happens	V
in	
a	
computer	
-	
needs	V
a	
re-start	
from	
time	
to	
time	
but	
it	
should	
n't	
be	V
happening	V
in	
a

taking	V
a

I	
decided	V
to	
get	V
a	
150	
gal	
aquarium	
,	
what	
can	
I	
fill	V
it	
with	
?	

I	
was	V
thinking	V
cichlids	
?	

Possibly	
a	
freshwater	
tank	
with	
a	
ton	
of	
different	
species	
in	
there	
.	

I	
've	V
never	
kept	V
cichlids	
though	
.	

I	
know	V
saltwater	
is	V
a	
possibility	
,	
can	
you	
give	V
me	
a	
possible	
stocking	
option	
for	
that	
too	
?	

I	
'll	
choose	V
the	
one	
that	
sounds	V
the	
best	
after	
looking	V
into	
all	
the	
fish	
:)	

Here	
is	V
the	
stocking	V
for	
my	
150	
gallon	
tank	
i	
upgraded	V
it	
to	
200	
at	
the	
weekend	
because	
of	
the	
clownloach	
A	
200	
gallon	
with	
6	
pairs	
of	
Breeding	
Angel	
fish	
fire

5

Krib	
and	
5	
1	
inch

loach	
with

5

If	
you	
took	V
out	
the	
clown	
loach	
it	
would	
make	V
a	
nice	
150	
gallon	
tank

It	
can	
be	V
a

on

just	
ask	V
them

what	
you

The

do	V

It

an

a

have	V

They

my

Which	
should	
be	V
a	
private	
issue	V

I	
hired	V
this	
company	
to	
unlock	V
my	
car	
.	

The	
price	V
they	
gave	V
was	V
good	V
so	
I	
said	V
hey	
this	
seems	V
great	V
.	

After	
they	
showed	V
up	
there	
was	V
a	
little	
trouble	
to	
get	V
my	
car	
unlocked	V
,	
it	
took	V
quite	
a	
bit	
of	
time	
but	
the	
job	
was	V
well	
done

Bulwark	
regarding	
service	V
by	
Eric	

Just	
wanted	V
you	
to	
know	V
that	
Eric	
came	V
by	
as	
scheduled	V
today	
and	
sprayed	V
our	
house	
for	
scorpions	
.	

He	
seemed	V
to	
understand	V
how	
important	
it	
was	V
for	
us	
to	
make	V
sure	V
the	
whole	
house	
was	V
sprayed	V
so	
he	
took	V
his	
time	
.	

Thank	V
you	
!	

A	
TERRIBLE	
EXPERIENCE	V
!	

I	
remain	V
unhappy	V
.	

I	
still	
have	V
noticeable	
scarring	V
.	

I	
still	
have	V
surgically	
induced	
hair	
loss	V
.	

My	
results	
were	V
just	
AWFUL	V
.	

My	
post-op	
treatment	V
was	V
TERRIBLE	V
.	

I	
would	
n't	
recommend	V
this	
place	
last	
year	
,	
and	
I	
certainly	
would	
n't	
recommend	V
them	
this	
year

Go	V

My	
favorite	
place

My	
daughter

I	
stayed	V
here	
again	
from	
the	
7th	
to	
the	
14th	
of	
December

yet	
again	
it	
was	V
a	
great	
stay	V
from	
begiinning	V
to	
end	V
.	

Okay	
our	
room	
was	V
at	
times	
noisy	
but	
we	
were	V

Expect	V
either	
undercooked

mushy	
food	
and	
lackluster	
service	V
.	

The	
investors	
put	V
big	
bucks	
into	
the	
building	
but	
are	V
clueless	V
about	
what	
makes	V
a	
good	
dining	V
or

Even	
the	
least	
discriminating	
diner	
would

I	
have	V

going	V
there

a

Believe	V
it	
or	
not

but	
the	
channel	
guide	
has	V
been	V
most	
helpful	V
to	
my	
family

that	
visit	V

do	V
n't	
know	V
where	
to

when	
it

Michael	
helped	V
shoot	V
the	
majority	
of	
my	
firm	
's	
website	
and	
we	
could	
not	
have	V
been	V
happier	V

We	
went	V
through	
six	
photographers	
to	
find	V
the	
right	
photographers	
that	
would	
represent	V
our	
firm	
in	
the	
light	
we	
wished	V
to	
and	
Michael	
and	
his

made	V
that

deathly	
slow	
service	V

I	
have	V
eaten	V
here	
several	
times	
and	
every	
time	
the	
service	V
is	V
slower	V
than	
slow	
.	

One	
time	
we	
even	
left	V
after	
sitting	V
at	
the	
table	
for	
20	
minutes	
and	
not	
being	V
greeted	V
with	
a	
drink	
order	V

Ridiculous

There	
must	
be	V
a

Last

I	
went	V
however	
,	
my	
beer	
was	V
warm	V
and	
the	
service	V
was	V
so	
-	
so	
.	

I	
get	V
that	
careless	
teenager	
kind	
of	
treatment	V
from	
some	
of	
their	
staff

perhaps	
they	
should	
hire	V
more	
serious

cook	V

Very	
Mediocre	
donuts	
!	

The	
Donuts	
were	V
very	
over	
proofed	
,	
making	V
them	
stale	
and	
bready	
.	

The	
service	V
was	V
friendly	V
and	
fast	V
,	
but	
this	
just	
does	V
nt	
make	V
up	
for	
the	
lack	
-	
luster	
product	
.	

We	
tried	V
4	
different	
style	
of	
donuts	
,	
they	
were	V
all	
the	
same	
when	
it	
came	V
to	
quality

I

the	
Pad

the
