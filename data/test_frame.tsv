anyone	_

One	_

pointed	V.02
out	_
that	_

I	_
had	V.02
to	_
go	V.02
to	_
the	_
BBC	_
for	_
this	_
report	V.01

It	_
's	V.01
symptomatic	V.01

I	_
suppose	V.01
,	_
of	_
our	_
fast	_
-	_
paced	_

that	_
the	_
biggest	_

term	_
humanitarian	_
crisis	_

would	_
quickly	_
be	V.03
eclipsed	V.01
,	_
once	_
our	_
Secretary	_

was	V.01
finished	V.01
with	_
his	_
whirlwind	_
tour	V.01
,	_
from	_
the	_
newspapers	_
.	_

It	_
's	V.01
just	_
disappointing	V.01

Most	_
troubling	_
,	_
however	_
,	_
is	V.01
the	_
fact	_
that	_
the	_
political	_
will	_
to	_
end	V.01
the	_
crisis	_
expressed	V.01
a	_
few	_
short	_
weeks	_

seems	V.01
to	_
have	V.01
ebbed	V.01
.	_

At	_
that	_
time	_
,	_

Secretary	_
General	_
Kofi	_
Annan	_
demanded	V.01
steps	V.01
be	V.03
taken	V.LV
to	_
end	V.01
the	_
ethnic	_
violence	_
in	_
Darfur	_
within	_
48	_
hours	_
.	_

Two	_
weeks	_
later	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
violence	_
continues	V.01
.	_

The	_
African	_
Union	_
is	V.01
clearly	_
not	_
up	_
to	_
the	_
task	V.01
of	_
keeping	V.02
the	_
peace	V.01
,	_
pledging	V.01
300	_
troops	_
to	_
an	_
area	_
that	_
will	_
need	V.01
15,000	_
,	_
according	_
to	_
analysts	_
.	_

And	_
international	_
donors	_
have	V.01
given	V.01
only	_
half	_
of	_
the	_
relief	_
aid	V.01
that	_
Darfur	_
needs	V.01
,	_
according	_
to	_
the	_
local	_
UN	_
officials	_
.	_

So	_
hear	_
we	_
are	V.01
,	_
two	_
weeks	_
later	_
,	_
after	_
that	_
dazzling	_
PR	_

Powell	_

Annan	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
situation	_
on	_
the	_
ground	_
in	_
Darfur	_
appears	V.02
basically	_
unchanged	V.01

Buffett	_
's	_
usual	_
justification	V.01
for	_
keeping	V.01
most	_
of	_
his	_
money	_
was	V.01
that	_
he	_
was	V.03
still	_
compounding	V.01
the	_
value	_
of	_
his	_
fortune	_
at	_
a	_
pretty	_
high	_
rate	_
,	_
so	_
any	_
gifts	_
now	_
would	_
mean	V.01
significantly	_
less	_
money	_
for	_
the	_
foundation	_
later	_

It	_
's	V.01
a	_
little	_
hard	V.02
to	_
parse	V.01
,	_
but	_
at	_
this	_
point	_
his	_
ostensible	_
view	V.02
is	V.01
that	_
the	_
Gateses	_
are	V.01
very	_
good	_
money	_
-	_
redistributors	_
,	_
and	_
he	_
wants	V.01
them	_
to	_
have	V.03
the	_
money	_
as	_
soon	_
as	_
possible	_
.	_

Which	_
essentially	_
sounds	V.01
like	_
he	_
's	V.01
worried	V.01
that	_
Bill	_
or	_
Melinda	_
are	V.03
going	V.04
to	_
die	V.01
soon	_

I	_
assume	V.02
his	_
actual	_
reason	_
is	V.01
that	_
he	_
's	V.01
worried	V.01
that	_
Berkshire	_
Hathaway	_
just	_
ca	_
n't	_
grow	V.01
quickly	_
enough	_
to	_
justify	V.01
his	_
usual	_
charity	_
policy	_
.	_

I	_
'm	V.01
not	_
sure	V.02
how	_
the	_
market	_
will	_
react	V.01

It	_
does	V.01
n't	_
change	V.01
the	_
company	_
's	_
intrinsic	_
worth	_
,	_
and	_
as	_
the	_
article	_
notes	V.01
,	_
the	_
company	_
might	_
be	V.03
added	V.02
to	_
a	_
major	_
index	_
once	_
the	_
shares	V.01
get	V.03
more	_
liquid	_
.	_

On	_
the	_
other	_
hand	_
,	_
this	_
is	V.01
essentially	_
a	_
statement	V.01
that	_
the	_
company	_
is	V.01
overpriced	_
from	_
the	_
guy	_
who	_
knows	V.01
it	_
best	_
--	_
and	_
happens	V.02
to	_
be	V.01
the	_
best	_
investor	_
of	_
the	_
last	_

no	_

the	_
Gates	_
foundation	_
mainly	_
invests	V.01
in	_
medical	_
research	V.01
and	_
education	V.01

that	_
means	V.01
donating	V.01
now	_
adds	V.02
a	_
tremendous	_
value	_
compared	_
to	_
donating	V.01
in	_
ten	_
years	_

Because	_
the	_
10.000.000	_

otherwise	_
be	V.01
dead	_

He	_
's	V.03
not	_
giving	V.02
85	_

he	_
's	V.03
giving	V.01
a	_
number	_

his	_

's	_
death	V.01
having	V.LV
an	_
effect	V.01
on	_
him	_

sounds	V.01
pretty	_
rational	V.02

's	V.03
saying	V.01
that	_
Bill	_

This	_
acceptance	V.01
of	_
blatantly	_
terrorist	_
groups	_
as	_
legitimate	_
freedom	_
movements	V.07
is	V.01
a	_
cancerous	_
tumor	_
on	_
the	_

and	_
the	_

Over	_
three	_
years	_
after	_
9-11	_
,	_
the	_
United	_

,	_
despite	_
their	_
attempts	V.01
to	_
project	V.01
strength	_
in	_
fighting	V.01
terrorism	_
,	_
still	_
can	_
not	_
properly	_
define	V.01
the	_
word	_
"	_
terrorist	_

waffling	V.01
over	_
the	_
issue	V.02
of	_
whether	_
the	_
murder	V.01
of	_
innocent	_
civilians	_
are	V.01
terrorist	_
acts	_

The	_

routinely	_
obscures	V.01
the	_
lines	_
between	_
terrorism	_
and	_
legitimate	_
resistance	V.01

as	_
the	_
recent	_

demonstrates	V.01

The	_
decision	V.01
to	_
sidestep	V.01
the	_
obvious	_
to	_
satisfy	V.01
the	_
need	V.01
to	_
avoid	V.01
confrontation	V.01
does	V.01
not	_
bring	V.01
peace	V.01
,	_
but	_
only	_
delays	V.01
the	_
eventual	_
conflict	V.01
as	_
the	_
predators	_
of	_
Hamas	_

Hezbollah	_
exploit	V.01
the	_
inherent	_
weakness	_
of	_
the	_
internationals	_
and	_
the	_
media	_
.	_

I	_
've	V.01
been	V.03
fuming	V.01
over	_
this	_
fact	_
for	_
a	_
few	_
weeks	_
now	_
,	_
ever	_
since	_
some	_
organizations	_
and	_
governments	_
suggested	V.01
we	_
need	V.01
to	_
accept	V.01
the	_
fact	_
that	_
Hezbollah	_
will	_
get	V.03
involved	V.01
in	_
running	V.01
Lebanon	_
.	_

Wtf	_
is	V.01
this	_
?	_

This	_
is	V.01
a	_
terrorist	_
organization	_
plain	V.01
and	_
simple	V.02
.	_

This	_
is	V.01
the	_
organization	_
that	_
bombed	V.01
our	_
Marine	_
barracks	_
in	_
1983	_
,	_
took	V.03
Americans	_
hostage	_
throughout	_
the	_
80's	_
and	_
now	_
they	_
should	_
be	V.03
considered	V.01
a	_
legitimate	_
organization	_
?	_

This	_
is	V.01
just	_
another	_
reason	_
to	_
never	_
trust	V.02
the	_
MSM	_
,	_
and	_
certainly	_
not	_
the	_
Europeans	_

cooperate	V.01

Abu	_

Zarqawi	_
and	_
his	_

to	_

bitter	_
rivals	_
of	_
al	_
-	_

during	_
the	_
Afghan	_
resistance	_
days	_
.	_

One	_
witness	_
at	_
the	_
Moutasaddiq	_
trial	V.02
in	_
Germany	_
alleged	V.01
that	_
Zarqawi	_
had	V.01
not	_
allowed	V.01
Monotheism	_
and	_
Holy	_
War	_
to	_
share	V.01
resources	_
with	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
in	_
the	_
early	_
zeroes	_
of	_
the	_
21st	_
century	_
.	_

If	_
the	_
statement	V.01
is	V.01
true	V.01
,	_
it	_
is	V.01
a	_
worrying	_
sign	V.07
that	_
even	_
the	_
divided	_
small	_
radical	_
guerrilla	_
groups	_
are	V.03
being	V.03
"	_
picked	V.11
up	_
"	_
by	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
.	_

This	_
consolidation	V.01
is	V.01
obviously	_
a	_
result	_
of	_
Bush	_
's	_
aggressive	_
invasion	V.01
of	_
Iraq	_
and	_
of	_
the	_
botching	V.01
of	_
the	_
aftermath	_
.	_

It	_
is	V.01
a	_
setback	_
for	_
the	_
war	V.01
on	_
terror	_
.	_

Al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
in	_
Afghanistan	_
was	V.01
a	_
group	_
of	_
only	_
a	_
few	_
hundred	_
"	_
Afghan	_
Arabs	_
"	_
who	_
pledged	V.01
personal	_
loyalty	_
to	_
Usamah	_
Bin	_
Laden	_
.	_

It	_
could	_
notionally	_
be	V.03
expanded	V.01
to	_
encompass	V.01
the	_
5,000	_
-	_
strong	_
"	_
55th	_
Brigade	_
"	_
of	_
the	_
Taliban	_
regime	_
,	_
though	_
this	_
is	V.01
not	_
the	_
technical	_
definition	V.01
.	_

Because	_
Usamah	_
is	V.01
Saudi	_
,	_
my	_
guess	V.01
is	V.01
that	_
they	_
were	V.03
especially	_
influenced	V.01
by	_
an	_
extremist	_
form	_
of	_
the	_
Wahhabi	_
school	_
of	_
Islam	_
that	_
predominates	V.01
among	_
Saudia	_
's	_
some	_
15	_
million	_
citizens	_
.	_

In	_
1998	_
they	_
were	V.03
joined	V.04
by	_
Egyptians	_
from	_
the	_
al	_
-	_
Jihad	_
al	_
-	_
Islami	_
group	_
of	_
Ayman	_
al	_
-	_
Zawahiri	_
(	_
many	_
of	_
these	_
were	V.01
from	_
Upper	_
Egypt	_
,	_
especially	_
Asyut	_
and	_
environs	_
)	_
.	_

After	_
that	_
point	_
,	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
was	V.01
a	_
joint	_
enterprise	_
between	_
the	_
Egyptian	_
extremists	_
and	_
the	_
polyglot	_
Arabs	_
around	_
Bin	_
Laden	_
,	_
only	_
some	_
of	_
whom	_
were	V.01
Saudi	_
.	_

Zarqawi	_
is	V.01
a	_
Jordanian	_
,	_
and	_
his	_
Monotheism	_
and	_
Holy	_
War	_
group	_
in	_
Afghanistan	_
probably	_
had	V.03
a	_
distinctive	_
coloration	V.01
as	_
mainly	_
Jordanian	_
,	_
Palestinian	_
and	_
Syrian	_
.	_

They	_
also	_
had	V.03
a	_
special	_
connection	V.01
to	_
some	_
extremists	_
in	_
Jordan	_
and	_
Germany	_
.	_

They	_
are	V.03
probably	_
especially	_
oriented	V.01
toward	_
the	_
Salafi	_
school	_
of	_
modern	_
Islamic	_
thought	V.01
,	_
which	_
has	V.03
a	_
Protestant	_
-	_
like	_
emphasis	V.01
on	_
going	V.19
back	_
to	_
the	_
original	_
practice	_
of	_
the	_
early	_
companions	_
of	_
the	_
Prophet	_
Muhammad	_
.	_

(	_
Most	_
Salafis	_
are	V.01
not	_
militant	_
or	_
violent	V.01
,	_
though	_
they	_
tend	V.02
to	_
be	V.01
rather	_
narrow	_
-	_
minded	_
in	_
my	_
experience	V.01
,	_
on	_
the	_
order	_
of	_
Protestant	_
Pietists	_
)	_
.	_

Monotheism	_
and	_
Holy	_
War	_
obviously	_
does	V.01
have	V.LV
a	_
violent	_
interpretation	V.01
of	_
Salafism	_
,	_
rather	_
as	_
the	_
the	_
leaders	_
of	_
the	_
so	_
-	_
called	_
German	_
Peasant	_
Rebellion	_
among	_
early	_
Protestants	_
did	V.01
.	_

Another	_
worrisome	_
sign	V.07
is	V.01
that	_
local	_
Iraqi	_
Sunni	_
fundamentalists	_
opposed	V.01
to	_
the	_
US	_
presence	_
in	_
Iraq	_
have	V.01
begun	V.02
joining	V.04
Monotheism	_
and	_
Holy	_
War	_
,	_
and	_
wearing	V.01
its	_
distinctive	_
orange	_
and	_
black	_
insignia	_
.	_

These	_
have	V.01
been	V.03
sighted	V.01
among	_
Iraqi	_
crowds	_
on	_
Haifa	_
Street	_
in	_
Baghdad	_
and	_
in	_
Samarra	_
.	_

So	_
now	_
there	_
are	V.02
hundreds	_
of	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
members	_
in	_
Iraq	_
where	_
there	_
had	V.01
been	V.02
none	_
before	_
.	_

The	_
consolidation	V.01
of	_
smaller	_
local	_
radical	_
fundamentalist	_
groups	_
with	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
can	_
also	_
be	V.03
seen	V.01
in	_
the	_
case	V.04
of	_
the	_
Fizazi	_
group	_
in	_
Tangiers	_
that	_
morphed	V.01
into	_
the	_
Moroccan	_
Islamic	_
Combatant	_
Group	_
,	_
had	V.03
members	_
who	_
met	V.03
with	_
September	_
11	_
ringleader	_
Muhammad	_
Atta	_
,	_
and	_
ultimately	_
was	V.01
in	_
part	_
responsible	V.03
for	_
the	_
Madrid	_
train	_
bombings	V.01
.	_

The	_
September	_
11	_
Panel	_
will	_
issue	V.01
its	_
findings	V.01
on	_
Thursday	_
.	_

It	_
notes	V.01
10	_
points	_
at	_
which	_
the	_
US	_
made	V.LV
key	_
mistakes	V.02
that	_
might	_
have	V.01
stopped	V.01
Bin	_
Laden	_
's	_
plot	V.01
.	_

Four	_
of	_
these	_
were	V.01
under	_
Clinton	_
and	_
6	_
under	_
Bush	_
.	_

Bush	_
came	V.09
out	_
today	_
and	_
said	V.01
that	_
if	_
he	_
had	V.01
known	V.01
what	_
was	V.03
coming	V.03
,	_
he	_
would	_
have	V.01
expended	V.01
every	_
effort	V.01
to	_
stop	V.01
it	_
,	_
and	_
that	_
so	_
would	_
have	V.01
Clinton	_
.	_

This	_
statement	V.01
is	V.01
,	_
despite	_
its	_
facade	_
of	_
fair	_
-	_
mindedness	_
,	_
so	_
many	_
weasel	_
words	_
.	_

Of	_
course	_
Bush	_
would	_
have	V.01
tried	V.01
to	_
stop	V.01
9/11	_
if	_
he	_
had	V.01
known	V.01
it	_
was	V.03
coming	V.03
.	_

The	_
question	V.01
is	V.01
,	_
"	_
Should	_
he	_
have	V.01
known	V.01
it	_
was	V.03
coming	V.03
?	_
"	_

The	_
answer	V.01
is	V.01
,	_
"	_
Yes	_
!	_
"	_

We	_
now	_
know	V.01
that	_
Bush	_
and	_
his	_
administration	V.01
came	V.04
into	_
office	_
obsessed	V.01
with	_
Iraq	_
.	_

Cheney	_
was	V.03
looking	V.01
at	_
maps	_
of	_
Iraq	_
oil	_
fields	_
and	_
muttering	V.01
about	_
opportunities	_
for	_
US	_
companies	_
there	_
,	_
already	_
in	_
January	_
or	_
February	_
of	_
2001	_
.	_

Wolfowitz	_
contradicted	V.01
counter-terrorism	_
czar	_
Richard	_
Clarke	_
when	_
the	_
latter	_
spoke	V.01
of	_
the	_
al	_
-	_
Qaeda	_
threat	_
,	_
insisting	V.01
that	_
the	_
preeminent	_
threat	_
of	_
terrorism	_
against	_
the	_
US	_
came	V.01
from	_
Iraq	_
,	_
and	_
indicating	V.01
he	_
accepted	V.01
Laurie	_
Mylroie	_
's	_
crackpot	_
conspiracy	_
theory	_
that	_
Saddam	_
was	V.01
behind	_
the	_
1993	_
World	_
Trade	_
Towers	_
bombing	V.01
.	_

If	_
you	_
believe	V.01
crackpot	_
theories	_
instead	_
of	_
focusing	V.01
on	_
the	_
reality	_
--	_
that	_
was	V.01
an	_
al	_

operation	V.01

,	_
an	_
Egyptian	_
terrorist	_
component	_
allied	V.01
with	_
Bin	_
Laden	_
--	_
then	_
you	_
will	_
concentrate	V.01
on	_
the	_
wrong	_
threat	_
.	_

Even	_
after	_
the	_
attacks	V.01
on	_
September	_
11	_
,	_
Bush	_
was	V.03
obsessing	V.01
about	_
Iraq	_
.	_

Wolfowitz	_
lied	V.08
to	_
him	_
and	_
said	V.01
that	_
there	_
was	V.02
a	_
10	_
to	_
50	_
%	_
chance	V.02
that	_
Iraq	_
was	V.01
behind	_
them	_

The	_

need	V.01
the	_
Pakistan	_
base	_
for	_
rescue	_
operations	V.01
in	_
case	_
anything	_
went	V.08
wrong	V.02
.	_

You	_
also	_
need	V.01
Pakistani	_
air	_
space	_
.	_

The	_
plan	V.01
was	V.01
all	_
set	V.08
and	_
could	_
have	V.01
succeeded	V.01
.	_

But	_
in	_
fall	_
of	_
1999	_
,	_
Gen.	_
Pervez	_
Musharraf	_
made	V.LV
a	_
coup	V.01
against	_
Nawaz	_
Sharif	_
.	_

The	_
Pakistani	_
army	_
was	V.01
rife	V.01
with	_
elements	_
protective	_
of	_
the	_
Taliban	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
new	_
military	_
government	_
reneged	V.01
on	_
the	_
deal	V.01
.	_

Musharraf	_
told	V.01
Clinton	_
he	_
could	_
n't	_
use	V.01
Pakistani	_
soil	_
or	_
air	_
space	_
to	_
send	V.02
the	_
team	_
in	_
against	_
Bin	_
Laden	_
.	_

Look	V.01
at	_
a	_
map	_
and	_
you	_
try	V.01
to	_
figure	V.05
out	_
how	_
,	_
in	_
fall	_
of	_
1999	_
,	_
you	_
could	_
possibly	_
pull	V.03
off	_
such	_
an	_
operation	V.01
without	_
Pakistani	_
facilities	_
.	_

Of	_
course	_
,	_
you	_
could	_
just	_
go	V.02
in	_
by	_
main	_
force	_
.	_

But	_
for	_
those	_
of	_
you	_
tempted	V.01
in	_
that	_
direction	_
,	_
please	_
look	V.05
up	_
Carter	_
's	_
Tabas	_
operation	V.01
.	_

It	_
should	_
be	V.03
easily	_
googled	V.01
.	_

Clinton	_
tried	V.01
,	_
and	_
tried	V.01
hard	_
.	_

The	_
gods	_
were	V.01
n't	_
with	_
us	_
on	_
that	_
one	_
.	_

that	_
is	V.01
how	_
i	_
want	V.01
you	_
to	_
refer	V.01
to	_
me	_
as	_
"	_

i	_
do	V.01
n't	_

,	_

Hello	_
from	_
South	_
America	_
.	_

I	_
just	_
got	V.01
your	_
email	V.01
and	_
I	_
certainly	_
concur	V.01
with	_
Jeff	_
making	V.LV
the	_
call	V.02
.	_

He	_
has	V.01
maintained	V.01
a	_
good	_
relationship	V.03
with	_
Mulva	_
.	_

This	_
was	V.01
a	_
risk	V.01
that	_
we	_
had	V.LV
but	_
we	_
did	V.01
have	V.LV
assurances	V.01
from	_
Phillips	_
regarding	_
performance	V.02
.	_

I	_
do	V.01
n't	_
know	V.01
how	_
much	_
it	_
will	_
help	V.01
however	_
.	_

Richard	_
Harper	_
and	_
Mary	_
Nell	_
Browning	_
may	_
have	V.03
some	_
ideas	_
here	_
but	_
I	_
am	V.01
sure	V.02
you	_
've	V.01
already	_
gone	V.06
through	_
it	_
with	_
them	_
.	_

I	_
am	V.01
amazed	V.01
how	_
the	_
details	_
get	V.03
fuzzy	V.01
on	_
an	_
old	_
project	_
.	_

When	_
you	_
discussed	V.01
it	_
,	_
i	_
was	V.03
trying	V.01
to	_
think	V.01
back	_
to	_
our	_
remedies	_
and	_
discussions	V.01
but	_
the	_
3	_
years	_
have	V.01
made	V.02
it	_
difficult	V.01
.	_

I	_
do	V.01
n't	_
know	V.01
if	_
there	_
is	V.02
anything	_
I	_
can	_
do	V.02
but	_
I	_
'm	V.01
always	_
willing	V.02
to	_
help	V.01
.	_

Good	_
luck	_
,	_

These	_
guys	_

not	_

i	_

that	_
the	_

is	V.01
it	_

I	_
'll	_

I	_

We	_

this	_

Hi	_

Thought	V.01
that	_
you	_
might	_
be	V.01
interested	V.01

Best	_
,	_

Jeff	_

Well	_
,	_
he	_
launched	V.01
today	_
.	_

Have	V.01
you	_
seen	V.01
the	_
materials	_
from	_
the	_
press	_
conference	V.01
that	_
he	_
launched	V.01
today	_
?	_

I	_
think	V.01
this	_
is	V.01
actually	_
a	_
good	_
thing	_
--	_
makes	V.02
our	_
proposal	V.01
look	V.02
like	_
a	_
much	_
more	_
preferable	_
alternative	_
by	_
comparison	V.01
,	_
makes	V.02
our	_
support	V.01
in	_
the	_
process	V.02
more	_
important	V.01
,	_
and	_
sets	V.03
Harvey	_
up	_
as	_
the	_
Ralph	_

in	_

Hi	_

Well	_
,	_
would	_
n't	_
you	_
know	V.01
it	_
.	_

I	_
'm	V.03
not	_
driving	V.01
tonite	_
,	_
but	_
I	_
bet	V.01
that	_
we	_
could	_
hitch	V.01
a	_
ride	V.01
back	_
with	_
Anil	_
.	_

I	_
'm	V.01
not	_
sure	V.02
,	_
but	_
I	_
think	V.01
that	_
he	_
's	V.01
got	V.02
class	_
tonite	_
,	_
too	_
.	_

I	_
'll	_
search	V.01
him	_
out	_
before	_
class	_
or	_
after	_
that	_
break	V.19
and	_
see	V.01
if	_
I	_
can	_
set	V.03
it	_
up	_
.	_

daily	_
dose	_
on	_
enron	_

we	_
are	V.01
finished	V.01

i	_
need	V.01
to	_
now	_
get	V.01
a	_
job	_
at	_
house	_
of	_
pies	_
b/c	_
that	_
is	V.01
the	_
only	_
way	_
to	_
pay	V.01
the	_
bills	_
.	_

the	_
economy	_
is	V.01
down	_
and	_
when	_
enron	_
collapses	V.01
,	_
the	_
energy	_
industry	_
is	V.03
going	V.04
to	_
be	V.01
in	_
a	_
world	_
of	_
hurt	_
.	_

not	_
to	_
mention	_
the	_
market	_
is	V.03
going	V.04
to	_
be	V.03
flooded	V.01
with	_
enron	_
folks	_
.	_

ca	_
n't	_
go	V.02
to	_
any	_
more	_
lsu	_
games	_
unless	_
i	_
get	V.01
a	_
free	_
ticket	_
.	_

Since	_
work	V.01
has	V.01
gone	V.01
to	_
hell	_
,	_
I	_
am	V.03
hoping	V.01
to	_
find	V.01
some	_
excitement	V.01
in	_
the	_
possibility	_
that	_
LSU	_
may	_
play	V.01
in	_
the	_
Cotton	_

(	_
if	_
Rohan	_

Alabama	_
"	_
Davey	_
shows	V.02
up	_
for	_
the	_
next	_
3	_

However	_
,	_
do	V.01
not	_
purchase	V.01

it	_

Further	_
to	_
my	_

our	_

in	_
credit	V.01
are	V.03
calculating	V.01
the	_

on	_
the	_

They	_
are	V.03
currently	_
using	V.01

on	_
the	_

Can	_

Ideally	_

we	_

In	_

currently	_
assuming	V.02
that	_
there	_
is	V.02
no	_

may	_

be	V.03
double	_

I	_
was	V.03
wondering	V.01
if	_
it	_
would	_
be	V.01
OK	_
for	_
me	_
to	_
sit	V.05

with	_
you	_
one	_
day	_
to	_
get	V.01
a	_
general	_
feel	_
of	_
your	_
end	_
of	_
the	_
process	V.02
.	_

Pat	_
had	V.01
told	V.01
me	_
before	_
he	_
left	V.11
that	_
it	_
would	_
help	V.01
me	_
better	_
grasp	V.01
the	_
process	V.02
as	_
a	_
whole	_
.	_

I	_
understand	V.01
the	_
imminent	_
cold	_
weather	_
is	V.03
making	V.02
things	_
crazy	V.03

so	_
now	_
may	_
not	_
be	V.01
the	_
best	_
time	_
to	_
be	V.01
in	_
your	_

let	V.01
me	_
know	V.01
if	_
I	_
can	_
spend	V.02

just	_
an	_

down	_

you	_
whenever	_
it	_
is	V.01
a	_
good	_
time	_

think	V.01
it	_
will	_
help	V.01

The	_
Dow	_
topped	V.05
out	_
in	_
February	_
of	_
1966	_
at	_
995	_
.	_

By	_
September	_
of	_
that	_
year	_
the	_
Dow	_
had	V.01
tumbled	V.01
to	_
744	_
.	_

The	_
Dow	_
then	_
rallied	V.02
to	_
a	_
high	_
of	_
943	_
in	_
September	_
of	_
'67	_
.	_

By	_
March	_
of	_
'68	_
the	_
Dow	_
had	V.01
fallen	V.01
to	_
825	_
,	_
only	_
to	_
climb	V.02
to	_
a	_
highly	_
speculative	_
peak	_
of	_
985	_
in	_
December	_
of	_
'68	_
.	_

The	_
Dow	_
then	_
sank	V.01
to	_
631	_
in	_
December	_
of	_
'70	_
.	_

By	_
April	_
of	_
'71	_
the	_
Dow	_
had	V.01
climbed	V.02
back	_
to	_
950	_
,	_
only	_
to	_
fall	V.01
to	_
869	_
in	_
February	_
of	_
'72	_
.	_

A	_
big	_
rally	V.01
then	_
took	V.01
the	_
Dow	_
(	_
unconfirmed	_
)	_
to	_
a	_
record	_
high	_
of	_
1051	_
in	_
January	_
of	_
'73	_
,	_
turning	V.02
everyone	_
bullish	_
.	_

But	_
by	_
December	_
of	_
'73	_
the	_
Dow	_
had	V.01
collapsed	V.02
to	_
788	_
.	_

Think	V.01
that	_
was	V.01
bad	V.07
-	_
by	_
December	_
of	_
'74	_
the	_
Dow	_
had	V.01
sunk	V.01
to	_
a	_
bear	_
market	_
low	_
of	_
577	_
.	_

At	_
that	_
time	_
,	_
the	_
gurus	_
and	_
geniuses	_
of	_
Wall	_
Street	_
were	V.03
predicting	V.01
a	_
250	_
Dow	_
and	_
many	_
were	V.03
talking	V.01
openly	_
about	_
the	_
end	V.01
of	_
capitalism	_
.	_

Of	_
course	_
,	_
that	_
was	V.01
the	_
bottom	_

And	_
that	_
's	V.01
the	_
way	V.01
the	_
greatest	_
bear	_
market	_
since	_
the	_
Depression	_
worked	V.06
its	_
way	V.01
down	_
.	_

By	_
late	_
1974	_
investors	_
were	V.01
dizzy	V.02
,	_
they	_
were	V.01
desperate	V.01
,	_
they	_
were	V.03
wrung	V.03

out	_
,	_
they	_
had	V.01
left	V.15
Wall	_

many	_
for	_
good	_

The	_

PVT	_
test	V.01
conducted	V.01
on	_
Nville	_
have	V.01
been	V.03
discussed	V.01
with	_
each	_
of	_
you	_
over	_
the	_

three	_
months	_

As	_
we	_

discussed	V.01
....	_
effective	V.04
Sep	_
13th	_
,	_
Anita	_
will	_
make	V.LV
the	_
adjustments	V.01
to	_
Enron	_
's	_
inventory	_
and	_
pad	_

to	_
reflect	V.01
the	_
February	_
26th	_
results	_
.	_

I	_
talked	V.01
with	_
Gary	_

,	_
and	_
he	_
confirmed	V.01
that	_
the	_
revised	_
values	_
are	V.01
correct	V.02
.	_

Attached	V.01
is	V.03
a	_
spreadsheet	_
that	_
contains	V.01
the	_

The	_
correction	V.01
to	_
the	_
working	_

includes	V.01
TWO	_

In	_
addition	V.02
,	_
there	_
is	V.02
a	_
reduction	V.01
of	_
22,101	_
MMBTU	_
which	_
is	V.01
the	_
difference	V.02
between	_
the	_
SCADA	_
values	_
(	_
Best	_
Available	_
)	_
that	_
Anita	_
showed	V.01

the	_

now	_
be	V.01
3,993,310	_

instead	_
of	_

are	V.03
clean	_
and	_
blacklined	_
drafts	_
of	_
the	_
Enron	_
guaranties	V.01
to	_
be	V.03
made	V.LV
in	_
support	V.01
of	_
EPMI	_

The	_
guaranty	_
for	_
the	_
PPA	_
is	V.03
blacklined	V.01
against	_
the	_
Enron	_
EPC	_
Contract	_
guaranty	_
in	_
favor	_
of	_
the	_

which	_
was	V.03
granted	V.01
in	_
connection	V.01
with	_
our	_
Cabazon	_
Wind	_
Power	_

(	_
the	_

and	_
the	_

As	_
we	_

last	_
week	_

since	_
the	_
Enron	_
guaranties	_
will	_
need	V.01

acceptable	V.02
to	_
our	_

lenders	_

equity	_
participants	_
,	_
we	_
thought	V.01
that	_
we	_
should	_
start	V.01
with	_
a	_
form	_
that	_
was	V.03
used	V.01

and	_
that	_
was	V.03
negotiated	V.01

We	_
plan	V.01
to	_
use	V.01
the	_

basic	_
form	_
for	_
the	_
Enron	_
guaranty	V.01
that	_
will	_
be	V.03

I	_
thought	V.01
that	_
since	_
Chonawee	_
has	V.03
an	_
optimization	_
background	_

he	_
would	_
be	V.01
good	V.02
to	_
have	V.04
him	_
go	V.02
to	_
dinner	_
with	_
Dr.	_
Lasdon	_
on	_
Thrusday	_
as	_
well	_

Would	_
this	_
be	V.01
fine	V.04
?	_

Hello	_
there	_

Action	_
Network	_
is	V.01
a	_
BBC	_
website	_
for	_
people	_
who	_
are	V.03
taking	V.LV
action	V.02
on	_
issues	V.02
that	_
concern	V.02
them	_
.	_

I	_
'm	V.03
getting	V.03
in	_
touch	V.01
because	_
I	_
think	V.01
it	_
could	_
be	V.01
useful	V.05
to	_
people	_
campaigning	V.01
about	_
hospital	_
closures	_
.	_

We	_
've	V.01
got	V.02
a	_
page	_
dedicated	V.01
to	_
issues	V.02
around	_
hospitals	_
(	_
http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/C55153	_
)	_
and	_
a	_
group	_
called	V.01
NHS	_
SOS	_
have	V.01
already	_
put	V.11
up	_
a	_
campaign	V.01
about	_
ward	_
closures	_
in	_
Cumbria	_
.	_

I	_
'm	V.03
hoping	V.01
to	_
build	V.05
this	_
up	_
to	_
be	V.01
a	_
hub	_
for	_
all	_
the	_
campaigners	_
-	_
a	_
place	_
where	_
people	_
can	_
exchange	V.01
ideas	_
and	_
advice	_
.	_

It	_
would	_
be	V.01
great	V.01
if	_
the	_
person	_
from	_
CHANT	_
who	_
started	V.01
this	_
page	_
would	_
put	V.01
up	_
a	_
short	_
description	V.01
of	_
the	_
campaign	V.01
and	_
a	_
list	_
to	_
this	_
group	_
page	_
on	_
the	_
Action	_
Network	_
site	_
.	_

Action	_
Network	_
is	V.01
also	_
a	_
good	_
place	_
to	_
post	V.01
details	_
of	_
events	_
,	_
or	_
try	V.01
to	_
rally	V.01
together	_
a	_
group	_
if	_
you	_
want	V.01
to	_
take	V.LV
action	V.02
in	_
your	_
area	_
.	_

You	_
can	_
attach	V.01
anything	_
you	_
write	V.01
to	_
pages	_
for	_
your	_
local	_
area	_
,	_
as	_
well	_
as	_
to	_
the	_
'	_
issue	_
'	_
pages	_
.	_

I	_
'm	V.01
more	V.01
than	_
happy	_
to	_
help	V.01
people	_
with	_
the	_
site	_

just	_

the	_

stage	_
rocket	_
this	_
country	_
has	V.01
developed	V.02
in	_
more	_
than	_
a	_
decade	_
,	_
NASA	_
and	_
the	_
Pentagon	_
have	V.01
told	V.01
the	_
White	_

Lunar	_
landers	_

other	_
gear	_
needed	V.01
for	_
extended	_

be	V.03
lofted	V.01

,	_
the	_
most	_
powerful	_

ever	_
flown	V.01

It	_
looks	V.02
as	_
if	_
NASA	_
is	V.03
transitioning	V.01
away	_
from	_
the	_
shuttle	_
model	_
,	_
as	_
in	_
the	_
past	_
they	_
have	V.01
proven	V.01
to	_
be	V.01
quite	_
dangerous	V.01
as	_
Columbia	_
has	V.01
recently	_
proved	V.01
.	_

Although	_
these	_
new	_
rockets	_
are	V.01
probably	_
more	_
expensive	V.02
,	_
they	_
will	_
be	V.01
able	V.01
to	_
go	V.01
at	_
a	_
much	_
greater	_
range	_
than	_
it's	_
shuttle	_

,	_
as	_
they	_
can	_
not	_

break	V.16
free	V.04
from	_
the	_
atmosphere	_
but	_
reach	V.01
the	_
moon	_
as	_

"	_
NASA	_
will	_

and	_
solid	_
rocket	_

for	_
future	_
missions	V.01
to	_
the	_
moon	_
,	_
"	_
the	_
letter	_
said	V.01
.	_

NASA	_
is	V.03
planning	V.01
on	_
using	V.01
these	_
new	_
shuttles	_
to	_
replace	V.01
the	_
current	_
models	V.01
,	_
with	_
industry	_
forecasters	_
predicting	V.01
a	_
launch	V.01
as	_
early	_
as	_
2014	_
.	_

The	_
new	_
rocket	_
design	V.01
will	_
differ	V.02
slightly	_
from	_
it's	_
predecessors	_
,	_
in	_
the	_
fact	_
that	_
the	_
crew	_
and	_
cargo	_
would	_
launch	V.01
separately	_
from	_
two	_
different	_
rockets	_
each	_
and	_
join	V.02
up	_
in	_
space	_
later	_
on	_
.	_

Launching	V.01
this	_
way	V.01
will	_
hopefully	_
avoid	V.01
future	_
disasters	_
,	_
giving	V.LV
more	_
support	V.01

revisiting	V.01

i	_
doing	V.02

i	_
notice	V.01
that	_
there	_

two	_
statues	_
of	_

,	_
a	_
bronze	_
one	_
and	_
marble	_
one	_

Michelangelo	_
made	V.01
the	_
marble	_
one	_

why	_
did	V.01
he	_
do	V.02
another	_
if	_
Donatello	_
had	V.01
already	_
made	V.01
one	_
?	_

so	_
i	_
m	V.01
a	_
little	_
confused	V.01
,	_
why	_
is	V.02
there	_
two	_
statues	_
of	_
David	_
?	_

different	_
generations	_
,	_
the	_
donatello	_
is	V.01
of	_
a	_
boy	_
david	_
as	_
a	_
young	_
sheep	_
Herder	_
,	_
the	_
Michelangelo	_
is	V.01
the	_
grown	_
up	_
man	_
david	_
as	_
slayer	_
and	_
king	_

Because	_
he	_
liked	V.01
making	V.01
statues	_
of	_
David	_
!	_
:D	_

Obviously	_
,	_
he	_
should	_
have	V.01
been	V.03
arrested	V.01
and	_
jailed	V.01
-	_
imagine	V.01
making	V.01
a	_
statue	_
or	_
painting	_
on	_
the	_
same	_
subject	_
as	_
another	_
artist	_
-	_
clearly	_
insulting	_
and	_
disrespecting	_
-	_
wasted	_
time	_
that	_
could	_
have	V.01
been	V.03

Name	_
of	_
specific	_
Hibachi	_
restaurant	_
in	_
Chicago	_
?	_

I	_
have	V.03
a	_
friend	_
out	_
in	_
Chicago	_
this	_
week	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
am	V.03
trying	V.01
to	_
remember	V.01
the	_
name	_
of	_
an	_
awesome	_
hibachi	_
style	_
restaurant	_
i	_
visited	V.01
while	_
out	_
there	_
a	_
couple	_
years	_
ago	_
.	_

I	_
think	V.01
it	_
was	V.01
in	_
the	_
Lincoln	_
Square	_
area	_
but	_
do	V.01
n't	_
quote	V.01
me	_
on	_
that	_
.	_

It's	_
'	_
gimmick	_
'	_
was	V.01
that	_
you	_
fill	V.01
your	_
bowl	_
cafeteria	_
-	_
style	_
from	_
raw	_
ingredients	_
and	_
leave	V.12
it	_
on	_
the	_
counter	_
with	_
a	_
chopstick	_
listing	V.01
your	_
table	_
number	_
on	_
it	_
.	_

Four	_
guys	_
around	_
a	_
large	_
square	_
open	_
hibachi	_
cook	V.01
your	_
food	_
,	_
and	_
when	_
it	_
's	V.03
finished	V.01
a	_
server	_
brings	V.01
it	_
to	_
your	_
table	_
.	_

All	_
-	_
you	_
can	_
-	_
eat	V.01
style	_
deal	V.01
.	_

It	_
was	V.01
pretty	_
epic	_
as	_
I	_
remember	V.01
and	_
would	_
love	V.02
to	_
send	V.01
my	_
friend	_
there	_
.	_

Any	_
help	V.01
?	_

That	_
is	V.01

What	_
's	V.01
the	_
best	_
time	_
to	_
start	V.01
a	_
trip	V.03
around	_
the	_
world	_
?	_

Well	_
,	_
I	_
'm	V.01
about	_
to	_
graduate	V.01
in	_
less	_
then	_
a	_
year	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
'm	V.03
planning	V.01
to	_
study	V.01
medical	_
school	_
.	_

But	_
since	_
in	_
my	_
country	_
it	_
lasts	V.01
for	_
minimum	_
6	_
years	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
want	V.01
to	_
go	V.02
aground	_
the	_
world	_
,	_
what	_
do	V.01
you	_
think	V.01
,	_
should	_
I	_
do	V.02
it	_
before	_
or	_
after	_
medical	_
school	_
?	_

If	_
you	_
can	_
afford	V.01
to	_
go	V.02
before	_
,	_
then	_
by	_
all	_
means	_
,	_
GO	V.02
.	_

If	_
you	_
have	V.02
to	_
wait	V.01
,	_
due	_
to	_
financial	_
reasons	_
,	_
then	_
wait	V.01
.	_

I	_
would	_
much	_
rather	_
put	V.06
it	_
off	_
until	_
I	_
can	_
afford	V.01
to	_
have	V.LV
the	_
vacation	V.01
of	_
a	_
lifetime	_
as	_
I	_
'm	V.01
sure	V.02
this	_
trip	V.03
is	V.03
intended	V.01
to	_
be	V.01
.	_

Airfare	_
alone	_
will	_
be	V.01
incredibly	_
expensive	V.02
so	_
make	V.02
sure	V.01
you	_
have	V.03
the	_
money	_
and	_
of	_
course	_
free	_
time	_
to	_
take	V.01
your	_
time	_
and	_
have	V.03
a	_

time	_

did	V.01
anyone	_

Sounds	V.01
simple	V.02
enough	V.01
to	_
me	_
.	_

Your	_
camera	_
is	V.03
n't	_
acting	V.01
normally	_
,	_
you	_
got	V.01
warranty	_
,	_
let	V.01
Canon	_
deal	V.01
with	_
it	_

I	_
would	_
agree	V.01

I	_
shoot	V.03
a	_
t1i	_
and	_
have	V.01
n't	_
had	V.LV
such	_
an	_
issue	V.02
.	_

I	_
also	_
agree	V.01
it	_
's	V.01
under	_
warranty	_
so	_
get	V.03
in	_
touch	V.01
with	_
Canon	_
.	_

It	_
sounds	V.01
like	_
a	_
firmware	_
issue	V.02
and	_
the	_
camera	_
requires	V.01
a	_
re-boot	_
just	_
like	_
what	_
happens	V.01
in	_
a	_
computer	_
-	_
needs	V.01
a	_
re-start	_
from	_
time	_
to	_

it	_
should	_
n't	_
be	V.03

a	_
150	_

what	_
can	_
I	_
fill	V.01
it	_

was	V.03
thinking	V.01
cichlids	_

Possibly	_
a	_
freshwater	_
tank	_
with	_
a	_
ton	_
of	_

I	_
've	V.01
never	_

know	V.01

can	_
you	_
give	V.01
me	_
a	_
possible	_
stocking	_
option	_
for	_
that	_
too	_
?	_

I	_
'll	_
choose	V.01
the	_

sounds	V.01
the	_

after	_
looking	V.01

all	_
the	_

Here	_
is	V.01
the	_
stocking	V.01

i	_
upgraded	V.02
it	_
to	_
200	_
at	_
the	_
weekend	_
because	_
of	_
the	_

Best	_
Electrician	_
in	_
Florence	_

I	_
have	V.01
been	V.03
using	V.01
Steele	_
Electric	_
for	_
years	_
.	_

They	_
have	V.01
always	_
done	V.02
a	_
great	_
job	_
at	_
a	_
reasonable	_
price	V.01
.	_

Highly	_
recommended	V.01
.	_

Not	_
impressed	_
.	_

Overpriced	_
and	_
the	_
doctor	_
acted	V.01
arrogant	V.01
and	_
rushed	V.01
at	_
a	_
time	_
when	_
there	_
was	V.02
very	_
few	_
clients	_
in	_
the	_
facility	_
.	_

I	_
wo	_
n't	_
return	V.01

A	_
thoroughly	_
comprehensive	_
service	V.01
;	_
excellent	_
communication	V.01
and	_
best	_
of	_
they	_
are	V.01
transparent	V.01
with	_
their	_
fee	_
(	_
ie	_
nothing	_
is	V.03
simply	_
implied	V.01
or	_
assumed	V.02
)	_
.	_

I	_
gave	V.01
Dr.	_
Rohatgi	_
2	_
stars	_
because	_
her	_
assistant	_
was	V.01
very	_
pleasant	V.02
.	_

However	_
,	_
I	_
did	V.01
not	_
find	V.02
her	_
very	_
helpful	V.04
and	_
her	_
receptionist	_
was	V.01
rude	V.01
.	_

Extremely	_

Hit	V.07

were	V.03
n't	_
fully	_
cooked	V.01
last	_
time	_
I	_
went	V.02
there	_
.	_

Pretty	_
spendy	_
for	_
really	_
not	_
great	_
quality	_

The	_
management	V.01
and	_
staff	_
are	V.01

I	_
worked	V.01
with	_
Sam	_

who	_
took	V.LV
great	_
care	V.03
of	_
me	_

This	_
is	V.01
by	_

the	_
best	_

The	_
company	_
gets	V.03
busy	V.01
but	_
you	_
never	_
have	V.02
to	_
wait	V.01
long	_
because	_
they	_
ARE	V.01
orginizied	_

so	_
you	_
are	V.01
in	_

out	_

well	_

We	_

The	_

always	_
fresh	V.04

delicious	V.01

It	_
can	_
be	V.01
a	_
little	_
on	_
the	_
spicy	_
side	_
but	_
just	_
ask	V.02
them	_
exactly	_
what	_
you	_
want	V.01
and	_
they	_
are	V.01
very	_
helpful	V.04

I	_
really	_
want	V.01

like	V.01
this	_

I	_
work	V.01

around	_
the	_

Unfortunately	_
,	_
I	_
've	V.01
given	V.LV
it	_
a	_
couple	_

tries	V.01
at	_
different	_

decided	V.01
to	_
stop	V.01
going	V.02

The	_
employees	_
do	V.01
n't	_
really	_
seem	V.01
to	_
enjoy	V.01
what	_
they	_
are	V.03
doing	V.02
and	_
it	_
shows	V.01

Class	_
act	_

It	_
was	V.01
late	V.01
in	_
the	_
day	_
and	_
I	_
was	V.01
worried	V.01
I	_
would	_
get	V.03
charged	V.01
an	_
arm	_
and	_
a	_
leg	_
and	_
have	V.02
to	_
wait	V.01
forever	_

They	_
picked	V.04
my	_
car	_
up	_
in	_
Yarmouth	_

towed	V.01
to	_
Bath	_
for	_
a	_

issue	V.02

I	_
hired	V.01
this	_

to	_
unlock	V.01

The	_
price	V.01

I	_
said	V.01
hey	_
this	_

by	_
as	_
scheduled	V.01

sprayed	V.01
our	_

He	_
seemed	V.01
to	_

how	_
important	_
it	_
was	V.01
for	_
us	_
to	_
make	V.02

the	_

My	_

the	_

it	_
was	V.01
a	_
great	_
stay	V.01
from	_
begiinning	V.01
to	_
end	V.01

Okay	_
our	_
room	_
was	V.01
at	_
times	_
noisy	_

we	_
were	V.01

The	_

Michael	_
helped	V.01
shoot	V.03
the	_
majority	_
of	_
my	_
firm	_
's	_
website	_
and	_
we	_
could	_
not	_
have	V.01
been	V.01
happier	V.01

We	_
went	V.02
through	_
six	_
photographers	_
to	_
find	V.01
the	_
right	_
photographers	_
that	_
would	_
represent	V.01
our	_
firm	_
in	_
the	_
light	_
we	_
wished	V.01
to	_
and	_
Michael	_
and	_
his	_
team	_
made	V.02
that	_
happen	V.01

He	_
's	V.01

Average	_

deathly	_

service	V.02

I	_
have	V.01
eaten	V.01
here	_
several	_
times	_
and	_
every	_
time	_
the	_
service	V.02
is	V.01
slower	V.05
than	_
slow	_
.	_

One	_
time	_
we	_
even	_
left	V.11
after	_
sitting	V.01
at	_
the	_
table	_
for	_
20	_
minutes	_
and	_
not	_
being	V.03
greeted	V.01
with	_
a	_

the	_

that	_

kind	_
of	_
treatment	V.01

some	_

were	V.01
very	_
over	_

making	V.02
them	_

bready	_

The	_
service	V.02
was	V.01
friendly	V.01

this	_
just	_
does	V.01
nt	_
make	V.16
up	_
for	_
the	_
lack	_

We	_
tried	V.01
4	_
different	_
style	_
of	_
