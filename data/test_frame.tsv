a

anybody

not

John

One

Let	V.01
me	
join	V.04
the

annoyance	
over

,	
as	
noted	V.01

commits	V.02
just	
about	
every	
sin	
an	
online	
marketer	
could	
commit	V.02
,	
and	
makes	V.10
up	
a	
few	
new	
ones	
besides	
.	

I	
'm	V.01
not	
fond	V.01

.	

However	
,	
this	
toolbar	
is	V.01
really	
bad	
news	
.	

On	
the	
other	
hand	
,	
it	
looks	V.02
pretty	
cool	V.04
.	

Iran	
says	V.01
it	
is	V.03
creating	V.01
nuclear	
energy	
without	
wanting	V.01
nuclear	
weapons	
.	

The	
United	
States	
does	V.01
n't	
believe	V.01
the	
Iranian	
Government	
.	

One	
can	
suspect	V.01
the	
Iranian	
Government	
.	

But	
there	
is	V.02
no	
proof	V.01
.	

I	
read	V.01
an	
Article	
in	
Time	
magazine	
accusing	V.01
the	
Iranian	
Government	
of	
being	V.01
willing	V.02
to	
start	V.01
a	
nuclear	
war	V.01
and	
I	
sympathise	V.01
with	
the	
Article	
.	

They	
are	V.03
certainly	
being	V.01
nasty	V.01
to	
the	
United	
Nations	
Security	
Council	
in	
connection	V.01
with	
the	
anti-proliferation	
treaty	
.	

The	
President	
has	V.01
also	
said	V.01
he	
would	
like	V.02
to	
see	V.01
Israel	
wiped	V.01
off	
the	
map	
which	
he	
could	
n't	
even	
begin	V.02
to	
try	V.01
without	
nuclear	
weapons	
.	

But	
he	
has	V.01
insisted	V.01
that	
he	
wants	V.01
nuclear	
power	
for	
peaceful	
purposes	
.	

Many	
people	
want	V.01
to	
use	V.01
diplomacy	
with	
Iran	
rather	
than	
military	
pressure	
.	

But	
will	
diplomacy	
work	V.09
?	

And	
can	
anyone	
use	V.01
military	
pressure	
without	
proof	V.01
?	

One	
reader	
pointed	V.02
out	
that	
the	
President	
watched	V.01
the	
Americans	
in	
the	
embassy	
when	
they	
took	V.03
them	
hostage	
.	

He	
has	V.01
denied	V.01
this	
.	

We	
do	V.01
n't	
have	V.02
to	
believe	V.01
him	
.	

But	
we	
ca	
n't	
prove	V.01
it	
.	

It	
does	V.01
seem	V.01
that	
Iranians	
frequently	
make	V.LV
statements	V.01
and	
then	
hide	V.01
behind	
lack	V.01
of	
proof	V.01

Angry	
crowds	
chanted	V.01
anti-American	
slogans	
in	
the	
western	
city	
of	
Falluja	
(	
pop.

buried	V.01
on	
Saturday

Reuters	
reported	V.01
that	
"	
Sunni	
clerics	
in

It	
read	V.01

"

The	
clerics	
demanded	V.01
talks	V.01
with	
local	
US	
commanders

Falluja	
has	V.01
long	
been	V.03
roiled	V.01
by	
tense	
relations	V.03
with	
the	
US	
soldiers	
there	
,	
since	
local	
Sunnis	
either	
remain	V.01
committed	V.01
to	
Arab	
nationalism	
or	
have	V.01
become	V.01
Sunni	
fundamentalists	
or	
even	
radicals	
.	

Cities	
such	
as	
Falluja	
received	V.01
special	
treatment	V.01
from	
Saddam	
and	
enjoyed	V.01
a	
disproportionate	
share	V.01
of	
the	
country	
's	
wealth	
and	
power	
.	

They	
know	V.01
that	
the	
American	
advent	
implies	V.01
for	
them	
a	
demotion	V.01
,	
and	
an	
elevation	V.01
of	
the	
Shiites

has	V.01
pushed	V.01
Sudan	
not	
just	
off	
the	
front	
pages	
,	
or	
the	
A	
section	
,	
but	
out	
of	
the	
NY	
Times	
and	
Washington	
Post	
completely	
.	

I	
had	V.02
to	
go	V.02
to	
the	
BBC	
for	
this	
report	V.01
.	

It	
's	V.01
symptomatic	V.01
,	
I	
suppose	V.01
,	
of	
our	
fast	
-	
paced	
,	
24	
hour	
news	
-	
cycle	
lives	
,	
that	
the	
biggest	
short	
-	
term	
humanitarian	
crisis	
in	
the	
world	
would	
quickly	
be	V.03
eclipsed	V.01
,	
once	
our	
Secretary	
of	
State	
was	V.01
finished	V.01
with	
his	
whirlwind	
tour	V.01
,	
from	
the	
newspapers	
.	

It	
's	V.01
just	
disappointing	V.01
.	

Most	
troubling	
,	
however	
,	
is	V.01
the	
fact	
that	
the	
political	
will	
to	
end	V.01
the	
crisis	
expressed	V.01
a	
few	
short	
weeks	
ago	
seems	V.01
to	
have	V.01
ebbed	V.01
.	

At	
that	
time	
,	
UN	
Secretary	
General	
Kofi	
Annan	
demanded	V.01
steps	V.01
be	V.03
taken	V.LV
to	
end	V.01
the	
ethnic	
violence	
in	
Darfur	
within	
48	
hours	
.	

Two	
weeks	
later	
,	
and	
the	
violence	
continues	V.01
.	

The	
African	
Union	
is	V.01
clearly	
not	
up	
to	
the	
task	V.01
of	
keeping	V.02
the	
peace	V.01
,	
pledging	V.01
300	
troops	
to	
an	
area	
that	
will	
need	V.01
15,000	
,	
according	
to	
analysts	
.	

And	
international	
donors	
have	V.01
given	V.01
only	
half	
of	
the	
relief	
aid	V.01
that	
Darfur	
needs	V.01
,	
according	
to	
the	
local	
UN	
officials	
.	

So	
hear	
we	
are	V.01
,	
two	
weeks	
later	
,	
after	
that	
dazzling	
PR	
display	V.01
two	
weeks	
ago	
by	
Powell	
and	
Annan	
,	
and	
the	
situation	
on	
the	
ground	
in	
Darfur	
appears	V.02
basically	
unchanged	V.01
.	

Warren	
Buffett	
is	V.03
giving	V.02
away	
85	
%	
of	
his	
wealth	
,	
mostly	
to	
the	
Bill	
and	
Melinda	
Gates	
Foundation	
.	

It	
's	V.01
a	
move	V.01
that	
really	
worries	V.01
me	
;	
Buffett	
's	
usual	
justification	V.01
for	
keeping	V.01
most	
of	
his	
money	
was	V.01
that	
he	
was	V.03
still	
compounding	V.01
the	
value	
of	
his	
fortune	
at	
a	
pretty	
high	
rate	
,	
so	
any	
gifts	
now	
would	
mean	V.01
significantly	
less	
money	
for	
the	
foundation	
later	
.	

It	
's	V.01
a	
little	
hard	V.02
to	
parse	V.01
,	
but	
at	
this	
point	
his	
ostensible	
view	V.02
is	V.01
that	
the	
Gateses	
are	V.01
very	
good	
money	
-	
redistributors	
,	
and	
he	
wants	V.01
them	
to	
have	V.03
the	
money	
as	
soon	
as	
possible	
.	

Which	
essentially	
sounds	V.01
like	
he	
's	V.01
worried	V.01
that	
Bill	
or	
Melinda	
are	V.03
going	V.04
to	
die	V.01
soon	
.	

I	
assume	V.02
his	
actual	
reason	
is	V.01
that	
he	
's	V.01
worried	V.01
that	
Berkshire	
Hathaway	
just	
ca	
n't	
grow	V.01
quickly	
enough	
to	
justify	V.01
his	
usual	
charity	
policy	
.	

I	
'm	V.01
not	
sure	V.02
how	
the	
market	
will	
react	V.01
.	

It	
does	V.01
n't	
change	V.01
the	
company	
's	
intrinsic	
worth	
,	
and	
as	
the	
article	
notes	V.01
,	
the	
company	
might	
be	V.03
added	V.02
to	
a	
major	
index	
once	
the	
shares	V.01
get	V.03
more	
liquid	
.	

On	
the	
other	
hand	
,	
this	
is	V.01
essentially	
a	
statement	V.01
that	
the	
company	
is	V.01
overpriced	
from	
the	
guy	
who	
knows	V.01
it	
best	
--	
and	
happens	V.02
to	
be	V.01
the	
best	
investor	
of	
the	
last	
century	
.	

em	
...	
no	
...	
the	
Gates	
foundation	
mainly	
invests	V.01
in	
medical	
research	V.01
and	
education	V.01
,	
that	
means	V.01
donating	V.01
now	
adds	V.02
a	
tremendous	
value	
compared	
to	
donating	V.01
in	
ten	
years	
.

the	
10.000.000	
people	
dying	V.01

otherwise	
be	V.01
dead

i.e

He	
's	V.03
not	
giving	V.02

%	
away	
,	
he	
's	V.03
giving	V.01
a	
number	
of

each	
year	
that	
decrease	V.01
in	
number	
at	
the	
rate	
of	
5

(	
until	
gone

He	
mentions	V.01
his	
wife	
's	
death	V.01
having	V.LV
an	
effect	V.01
on	
him	
.	

It	
sounds	V.01
pretty	
rational	V.02
that	
he	
's	V.03
saying	V.01
that	
Bill	
and	
Melinda	
are	V.01
at	
a	
prime	
spot	
,	
so	
starting	V.01
the	
money	
hose	
now	
is	V.01
a	
good	
idea	
,	
but	
Buffet	
is	V.03
still	
keeping	V.01
most	
of	
his	
donation	V.01
inside	
of	
Berkshire	
where	
it	
will	
compound	V.01
.	

Bill	
over	
at	
The	
Fourth	
Rail	
has	V.03
an	
excellent	
essay	
on	
how	
the	
MSM	
and	
the	
UN	
,	
even	
the	
leftist	
countries	
in	
Europe	
,	
are	V.03
basically	
accepting	V.01
terrorist	
organizations	
as	
legitimate	
forms	
of	
a	
political	
party	
:	

On	
the	
same	
day	
Palestinians	
protest	V.01
in	
support	V.01
of	
Hezbollah	
and	
Syria	
,	
the	
terrorist	
group	
Hamas	
has	V.01
indicated	V.01
it	
will	
participate	V.01
in	
the	
scheduled	
upcoming	
Parliamentary	
elections	V.01
.	

To	
the	
north	
in	
Lebanon	
,	
there	
is	V.02
serious	
debate	V.01
within	
Hezbollah	
about	
entering	V.01
the	
Lebanese	
political	
process	V.02
in	
light	
of	
Syria	
's	
promised	
withdrawal	V.01
.	

Syria	
has	V.01
agreed	V.01
to	
withdraw	V.01
under	
the	
conditions	
set	V.02
forth	
in	
UNSC	
Resolution	
1559	
,	
which	
has	V.01
already	
begun	V.01
.	

UN	
Secretary	
-	
General	
Kofi	
Annan	
has	V.01
indicated	V.01
it	
is	V.01
time	
to	
"	
recognize	V.02
Hezbollah	
"	
after	
easily	
being	V.03
duped	V.01
by	
"	
the	
message	
on	
the	
placards	
they	
are	V.03
using	V.01
"	
.	

This	
acceptance	V.01
of	
blatantly	
terrorist	
groups	
as	
legitimate	
freedom	
movements	V.07
is	V.01
a	
cancerous	
tumor	
on	
the	
United	
Nations	
and	
the	
media	
.	

Over	
three	
years	
after	
9-11	
,	
the	
United	
Nations	
,	
despite	
their	
attempts	V.01
to	
project	V.01
strength	
in	
fighting	V.01
terrorism	
,	
still	
can	
not	
properly	
define	V.01
the	
word	
"	
terrorist	
"	
,	
waffling	V.01
over	
the	
issue	V.02
of	
whether	
the	
murder	V.01
of	
innocent	
civilians	
are	V.01
terrorist	
acts	
.	

The	
media	
routinely	
obscures	V.01
the	
lines	
between	
terrorism	
and	
legitimate	
resistance	V.01
,	
as	
the	
recent	
article	
by	
Daniel	
Okrent	
of	
The	
New	
York	
Times	
demonstrates	V.01
.	

...	

The	
decision	V.01
to	
sidestep	V.01
the	
obvious	
to	
satisfy	V.01
the	
need	V.01
to	
avoid	V.01
confrontation	V.01
does	V.01
not	
bring	V.01
peace	V.01
,	
but	
only	
delays	V.01
the	
eventual	
conflict	V.01
as	
the	
predators	
of	
Hamas	
and	
Hezbollah	
exploit	V.01
the	
inherent	
weakness	
of	
the	
internationals	
and	
the	
media	
.	

I	
've	V.01
been	V.03
fuming	V.01
over	
this	
fact	
for	
a	
few	
weeks	
now	
,	
ever	
since	
some	
organizations	
and	
governments	
suggested	V.01
we	
need	V.01
to	
accept	V.01
the	
fact	
that	
Hezbollah	
will	
get	V.03
involved	V.01
in	
running	V.01
Lebanon	
.	

Wtf	
is	V.01
this	
?	

This	
is	V.01
a	
terrorist	
organization	
plain	V.01
and	
simple	V.02
.	

This	
is	V.01
the	
organization	
that	
bombed	V.01
our	
Marine	
barracks	
in	
1983	
,	
took	V.03
Americans	
hostage	
throughout	
the	
80's	
and	
now	
they	
should	
be	V.03
considered	V.01
a	
legitimate	
organization	
?	

This	
is	V.01
just	
another	
reason	
to	
never	
trust	V.02
the	
MSM	
,	
and	
certainly	
not	
the	
Europeans	
.	

The	
Iraqi	
Islamic	
Party	
lead	V.02
by	
Muhsin	
Abdul	
Hamid	
,	
has	V.01
been	V.01
among	
the	
few	
Sunni	
Muslim	
groups	
willing	
to	
cooperate	V.01
(	
even	
if	
rather	
lukewarmly	
)	
with	
the	
Americans	
.	

It	
is	V.03
now	
threatening	V.01
to	
pull	V.02
out	
of	
the	
Allawi	
caretaker	
government	
.	

The	
IIP	
had	V.01
also	
been	V.01
the	
main	
force	
urging	V.01
Sunni	
Arabs	
to	
participate	V.01
in	
the	
elections	V.01
scheduled	V.01
for	
January	
,	
and	
had	V.01
been	V.03
opposed	V.01
in	
this	
stance	V.11
by	
the	
Association	
of	
Muslim	
Scholars	
.	

That	
the	
Iraqi	
Islamic	
Party	
is	V.03
now	
contemplating	V.01
leaving	V.15
the	
Allawi	
government	
raises	V.01
the	
question	V.01
of	
whether	
a	
mass	
Sunni	
Arab	
boycott	V.01
of	
the	
elections	V.01
is	V.01
in	
the	
offing	
,	
thus	
fatally	
weakening	V.01
the	
legitimacy	
of	
any	
new	
government	
.	

Az	
-	
Zaman	
:	
The	
Association	
of	
Muslim	
Scholars	
forbade	V.01
Iraqis	
to	
participate	V.01
in	
the	
attack	V.01
on	
Fallujah	
with	
the	
Americans	
.	

In	
a	
communique	
,	
the	
AMS	
said	V.01
that	
for	
Iraqis	
to	
take	V.01
part	
with	
"	
raiding	V.01
forces	
"	
in	
the	
assault	V.01
on	
a	
city	
,	
the	
population	V.01
of	
which	
is	V.01
Muslim	
(	
such	
as	
Fallujah	
)	
would	
be	V.03
considered	V.01
the	
most	
mortal	
of	
mortal	
sins	
.	

The	
Sunni	
AMS	
told	V.01
Iraqis	
,	
"	
You	
sinned	V.01
when	
you	
participated	V.01
with	
occupation	
forces	
in	
the	
assault	V.01
on	
Najaf	
,	
and	
beware	V.01
lest	
you	
repeat	V.01
this	
same	
sin	
in	
Fallujah	
.	

Remember	V.01
that	
the	
Occupation	V.01
is	V.01
emphemeral	
.	
"	

The	
radical	
Shiite	
Sadr	
movement	V.07
issued	V.01
a	
statement	V.01
forbidding	V.01
the	
participation	V.01
of	
Iraqi	
troops	
in	
the	
attack	V.01
on	
Fallujah	
,	
as	
well	
.	

The	
statement	V.01
said	V.01
,	
"	
We	
direct	V.01
an	
appeal	V.02
at	
the	
men	
in	
the	
Iraqi	
forces	
,	
whether	
national	
guards	
or	
others	
,	
the	
majority	
of	
whom	
are	V.01
Muslim	
,	
calling	V.12
upon	
them	
to	
refrain	V.01
for	
commiting	V.02
this	
enormous	
sin	
under	
the	
banner	
of	
forces	
that	
do	V.01
not	
respect	V.01
our	
religion	
or	
any	
principles	
of	
basic	
humanity	
,	
and	
we	
ask	V.02
them	
to	
view	V.02
this	
war	V.01
as	
illegal	
.	
"	

It	
called	V.01
a	
"	
ploy	
"	
the	
assertaion	V.01
that	
the	
attack	V.01
was	V.01
merely	
on	
foreign	
fighters	
at	
Fallujah	
.	

The	
convergence	V.01
of	
views	V.02
among	
the	
more	
militant	
Sunni	
Muslim	
clerics	
of	
AMS	
and	
the	
radical	
Shiites	
of	
the	
Sadr	
movement	V.07
has	V.01
been	V.03
seen	V.01
before	
,	
last	
spring	
during	
the	
initial	
US	
assault	V.01
on	
Fallujah	
and	
during	
the	
US	
attack	V.01
on	
Mahdi	
Army	
militiamen	
in	
Najaf	
.	

Most	
Shiites	
,	
however	
,	
are	V.01
still	
reluctant	V.01
to	
take	V.LV
major	
risks	V.01
to	
support	V.01
the	
Sunnis	
of	
Fallujah	
,	
many	
of	
whom	
had	V.01
supported	V.01
Saddam	
and	
his	
anti-Shiite	
pogroms	
.	

President	
Bush	
pinched	V.01
a	
few	
nerves	
yesterday	
with	
his	
choice	V.01
of	
words	
:	

WASHINGTON	
(	
Reuters	
)	
-	

U.S.	
Muslim	
groups	
criticized	
President	
Bush	
on	
Thursday	
for	
calling	V.01
a	
foiled	V.01
plot	V.01
to	
blow	V.06
up	
airplanes	
part	
of	
a	
"	
war	V.01
with	
Islamic	
fascists	
,	
"	
saying	V.01
the	
term	
could	
inflame	V.01
anti-Muslim	
tensions	V.01
.	

U.S.	
officials	
have	V.01
said	V.01
the	
plot	V.01
,	
thwarted	V.01
by	
Britain	
,	
to	
blow	V.06
up	
several	
aircraft	
over	
the	
Atlantic	
bore	V.06
many	
of	
the	
hallmarks	
of	
al	
Qaeda	
.	

"	
We	
believe	V.01
this	
is	V.01
an	
ill	
-	
advised	V.01
term	
and	
we	
believe	V.01
that	
it	
is	V.01
counterproductive	V.01
to	
associate	V.01
Islam	
or	
Muslims	
with	
fascism	
,	
"	
said	V.01
Nihad	
Awad	
,	
executive	
director	
of	
the	
Council	
on	
American	
-	
Islamic	
Relations	
advocacy

Which	
is	V.01
why	
he	
did	V.01
n't	
say	V.01
we	
're	V.01
at	
war	V.01
with	
Islamic	
people	
.	

We	
're	V.01
at	
war	V.01
with	
Islamic	
fascists	
.	

By	
using	V.01
the	
word	
"

"	
as	
an	
adjective	
Bush	
was	V.03
purposely	
not	
associating	V.01

We	
've	V.01

Steven

the	
one	
word	
that	
did	V.01
n't	
crash	V.01

despite

Folks	
,	
if	
it	
's	V.01
Islamic	
,	
and	
fascist	
,	
it	
's	V.01
an	
Islamic	
fascist

But	
because	
we	
do	V.01
n't	
want	V.01
to	
sound	V.01
hateful	
we	
must	
pretend	V.01
everyone	
's	V.01
a	
possible	
suspect	
and	
make	V.02
airline	
travel	V.01
more	
miserable	V.01
than	
it	
's	V.03
ever	
been	V.01
.	

On	
the	
internet	
site	
of	
Monotheism	
and	
Holy	
War	
(	
al	
-	
Tawhid	
wa	
al

,	
the	
group	
allegedly	
declared	V.01
,	
"	
We	
announce	V.01
that	
the	
Tawhid	
and	
Jihad	
Group	
,	
its	
prince	
and	
soldiers

have	V.01
pledged	V.01
allegiance	
to	
the	
sheikh	
of	
the	
mujahideen	
Osama	
bin	
Laden	
.	
"	

This	
pledge	
is	V.01
a	
new	
development	V.01
.	

Abu	
Musab	
al	
-	
Zarqawi	
and	
his	
group	
are	V.03
said	V.01
to	
have	V.01
been	V.01
bitter	
rivals	
of	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
during	
the	
Afghan	
resistance	
days	
.	

One	
witness	
at	
the	
Moutasaddiq	
trial	V.02
in	
Germany	
alleged	V.01
that	
Zarqawi	
had	V.01
not	
allowed	V.01
Monotheism	
and	
Holy	
War	
to	
share	V.01
resources	
with	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
in	
the	
early	
zeroes	
of	
the	
21st	
century	
.	

If	
the	
statement	V.01
is	V.01
true	V.01
,	
it	
is	V.01
a	
worrying	
sign	V.07
that	
even	
the	
divided	
small	
radical	
guerrilla	
groups	
are	V.03
being	V.03
"	
picked	V.11
up	
"	
by	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
.	

This	
consolidation	V.01
is	V.01
obviously	
a	
result	
of	
Bush	
's	
aggressive	
invasion	V.01
of	
Iraq	
and	
of	
the	
botching	V.01
of	
the	
aftermath	
.	

It	
is	V.01
a	
setback	
for	
the	
war	V.01
on	
terror	
.	

Al	
-	
Qaeda	
in	
Afghanistan	
was	V.01
a	
group	
of	
only	
a	
few	
hundred	
"	
Afghan	
Arabs	
"	
who	
pledged	V.01
personal	
loyalty	
to	
Usamah	
Bin	
Laden	
.	

It	
could	
notionally	
be	V.03
expanded	V.01
to	
encompass	V.01
the	
5,000	
-	
strong	
"	
55th	
Brigade	
"	
of	
the	
Taliban	
regime	
,	
though	
this	
is	V.01
not	
the	
technical	
definition	V.01
.	

Because	
Usamah	
is	V.01
Saudi	
,	
my	
guess	V.01
is	V.01
that	
they	
were	V.03
especially	
influenced	V.01
by	
an	
extremist	
form	
of	
the	
Wahhabi	
school	
of	
Islam	
that	
predominates	V.01
among	
Saudia	
's	
some	
15	
million	
citizens	
.	

In	
1998	
they	
were	V.03
joined	V.04
by	
Egyptians	
from	
the	
al	
-	
Jihad	
al	
-	
Islami	
group	
of	
Ayman	
al	
-	
Zawahiri	
(	
many	
of	
these	
were	V.01
from	
Upper	
Egypt	
,	
especially	
Asyut	
and	
environs	
)	
.	

After	
that	
point	
,	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
was	V.01
a	
joint	
enterprise	
between	
the	
Egyptian	
extremists	
and	
the	
polyglot	
Arabs	
around	
Bin	
Laden	
,	
only	
some	
of	
whom	
were	V.01
Saudi	
.	

Zarqawi	
is	V.01
a	
Jordanian	
,	
and	
his	
Monotheism	
and	
Holy	
War	
group	
in	
Afghanistan	
probably	
had	V.03
a	
distinctive	
coloration	V.01
as	
mainly	
Jordanian	
,	
Palestinian	
and	
Syrian	
.	

They	
also	
had	V.03
a	
special	
connection	V.01
to	
some	
extremists	
in	
Jordan	
and	
Germany	
.	

They	
are	V.03
probably	
especially	
oriented	V.01
toward	
the	
Salafi	
school	
of	
modern	
Islamic	
thought	V.01
,	
which	
has	V.03
a	
Protestant	
-	
like	
emphasis	V.01
on	
going	V.19
back	
to	
the	
original	
practice	
of	
the	
early	
companions	
of	
the	
Prophet	
Muhammad	
.	

(	
Most	
Salafis	
are	V.01
not	
militant	
or	
violent	V.01
,	
though	
they	
tend	V.02
to	
be	V.01
rather	
narrow	
-	
minded	
in	
my	
experience	V.01
,	
on	
the	
order	
of	
Protestant	
Pietists	
)	
.	

Monotheism	
and	
Holy	
War	
obviously	
does	V.01
have	V.LV
a	
violent	
interpretation	V.01
of	
Salafism	
,	
rather	
as	
the	
the	
leaders	
of	
the	
so	
-	
called	
German	
Peasant	
Rebellion	
among	
early	
Protestants	
did	V.01
.	

Another	
worrisome	
sign	V.07
is	V.01
that	
local	
Iraqi	
Sunni	
fundamentalists	
opposed	V.01
to	
the	
US	
presence	
in	
Iraq	
have	V.01
begun	V.02
joining	V.04
Monotheism	
and	
Holy	
War	
,	
and	
wearing	V.01
its	
distinctive	
orange	
and	
black	
insignia	
.	

These	
have	V.01
been	V.03
sighted	V.01
among	
Iraqi	
crowds	
on	
Haifa	
Street	
in	
Baghdad	
and	
in	
Samarra	
.	

So	
now	
there	
are	V.02
hundreds	
of	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
members	
in	
Iraq	
where	
there	
had	V.01
been	V.02
none	
before	
.	

The	
consolidation	V.01
of	
smaller	
local	
radical	
fundamentalist	
groups	
with	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
can	
also	
be	V.03
seen	V.01
in	
the	
case	V.04
of	
the	
Fizazi	
group	
in	
Tangiers	
that	
morphed	V.01
into	
the	
Moroccan	
Islamic	
Combatant	
Group	
,	
had	V.03
members	
who	
met	V.03
with	
September	
11	
ringleader	
Muhammad	
Atta	
,	
and	
ultimately	
was	V.01
in	
part	
responsible	V.03
for	
the	
Madrid	
train	
bombings	V.01
.	

The	
September	
11	
Panel	
will	
issue	V.01
its	
findings	V.01
on	
Thursday	
.	

It	
notes	V.01
10	
points	
at	
which	
the	
US	
made	V.LV
key	
mistakes	V.02
that	
might	
have	V.01
stopped	V.01
Bin	
Laden	
's	
plot	V.01
.	

Four	
of	
these	
were	V.01
under	
Clinton	
and	
6	
under	
Bush	
.	

Bush	
came	V.09
out	
today	
and	
said	V.01
that	
if	
he	
had	V.01
known	V.01
what	
was	V.03
coming	V.03
,	
he	
would	
have	V.01
expended	V.01
every	
effort	V.01
to	
stop	V.01
it	
,	
and	
that	
so	
would	
have	V.01
Clinton	
.	

This	
statement	V.01
is	V.01
,	
despite	
its	
facade	
of	
fair	
-	
mindedness	
,	
so	
many	
weasel	
words	
.	

Of	
course	
Bush	
would	
have	V.01
tried	V.01
to	
stop	V.01
9/11	
if	
he	
had	V.01
known	V.01
it	
was	V.03
coming	V.03
.	

The	
question	V.01
is	V.01
,	
"	
Should	
he	
have	V.01
known	V.01
it	
was	V.03
coming	V.03
?	
"	

The	
answer	V.01
is	V.01
,	
"	
Yes	
!	
"	

We	
now	
know	V.01
that	
Bush	
and	
his	
administration	V.01
came	V.04
into	
office	
obsessed	V.01
with	
Iraq	
.	

Cheney	
was	V.03
looking	V.01
at	
maps	
of	
Iraq	
oil	
fields	
and	
muttering	V.01
about	
opportunities	
for	
US	
companies	
there	
,	
already	
in	
January	
or	
February	
of	
2001	
.	

Wolfowitz	
contradicted	V.01
counter-terrorism	
czar	
Richard	
Clarke	
when	
the	
latter	
spoke	V.01
of	
the	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
threat	
,	
insisting	V.01
that	
the	
preeminent	
threat	
of	
terrorism	
against	
the	
US	
came	V.01
from	
Iraq	
,	
and	
indicating	V.01
he	
accepted	V.01
Laurie	
Mylroie	
's	
crackpot	
conspiracy	
theory	
that	
Saddam	
was	V.01
behind	
the	
1993	
World	
Trade	
Towers	
bombing	V.01
.	

If	
you	
believe	V.01
crackpot	
theories	
instead	
of	
focusing	V.01
on	
the	
reality	
--	
that	
was	V.01
an	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
operation	V.01
mainly	
carried	V.03
out	
by	
al	
-	
Gamaa	
al	
-	
Islamiyyah	
,	
an	
Egyptian	
terrorist	
component	
allied	V.01
with	
Bin	
Laden	
--	
then	
you	
will	
concentrate	V.01
on	
the	
wrong	
threat	
.	

Even	
after	
the	
attacks	V.01
on	
September	
11	
,	
Bush	
was	V.03
obsessing	V.01
about	
Iraq	
.	

Wolfowitz	
lied	V.08
to	
him	
and	
said	V.01
that	
there	
was	V.02
a	
10	
to	
50	
%	
chance	V.02
that	
Iraq	
was	V.01
behind	
them	
.	

(	
On	
what	
evidence	
?	

The	
hijackers	
were	V.01
obviously	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
,	
and	
no	
operational	
links	
between	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
and	
Iraq	
had	V.01
ever	
been	V.03
found	V.01
)	
.	

Rumsfeld	
initially	
rejected	V.01
an	
attack	V.01
on	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
bases	
in	
Afghanistan	
,	
saying	V.01
there	
were	V.02
"	
no	
good	
targets	
"	
in	
Afghanistan	
.	

(	
What	
about	
40	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
bases	
that	
had	V.01
trained	V.01
the	
9/11	
hijackers	
and	
other	
terrorists	
gunning	V.02
for	
the	
United	
States	
??	
)	

The	
Pentagon	
did	V.01
not	
even	
have	V.03
a	
plan	V.01
for	
dealing	V.01
with	
Afghanistan	
or	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
that	
it	
could	
pull	V.01
off	
the	
shelf	
,	
according	
to	
Bob	
Woodward	
.	

Bush	
did	V.01
not	
have	V.03
his	
eye	
on	
the	
ball	
.	

Neither	
did	
Cheney	
,	
Rumsfeld	
,	
or	
Wolfowitz	
.	

They	
were	V.03
playing	V.02
Captain	
Ahab	
to	
Saddam	
's	
great	
white	
whale	
.	

Imperial	
Hubris	
makes	V.LV
the	
case	V.03
that	
lots	
of	
people	
in	
the	
CIA	
and	
counter-terrorism	
divisions	
elsewhere	
in	
the	
US	
government	
knew	V.01
all	
about	
Bin	
Laden	
and	
the	
threat	
he	
posed	V.02
.	

They	
were	V.03
from	
all	
accounts	V.01
marginalized	V.01
and	
not	
listened	V.01
to	
.	

Bush	
demoted	V.01
Dick	
Clarke	
,	
among	
the	
most	
vocal	
and	
focused	
of	
the	
al	
-	
Qaeda	
experts	
,	
from	
his	
cabinet	
.	

Dick	
could	
never	
thereafter	
get	V.01
any	
real	
cooperation	V.01
from	
the	
cabinet	
officers	
,	
who	
outranked	V.01
him	
,	
and	
he	
could	
not	
convince	V.01
them	
to	
go	V.02
to	
battle	
stations	
in	
the	
summer	
of	
2001	
when	
George	
Tenet	
's	
hair	
was	V.01
"	
on	
fire	V.05
"	
about	
the	
excited	
chatter	
the	
CIA	
was	V.03
picking	V.11
up	
from	
radical	
Islamist	
terrorists	
.	

As	
for	
the	
Clinton	
administration	V.01
,	
let	V.01
me	
say	V.01
one	
thing	
in	
its	
defense	V.01
.	

Clinton	
had	V.01
worked	V.02
out	
a	
deal	V.01
with	
Pakistani	
Prime	
Minister	
Nawaz	
Sharif	
in	
summer	
of	
1999	
that	
would	
have	V.01
allowed	V.01
the	
US	
to	
send	V.02
a	
Special	
Ops	
team	
in	
after	
Bin	
Laden	
in	
Qandahar	
,	
based	V.01
from	
Pakistan	
.	

I	
presume	V.01
you	
need	V.01
the	
Pakistan	
base	
for	
rescue	
operations	V.01
in	
case	
anything	
went	V.08
wrong	V.02
.	

You	
also	
need	V.01
Pakistani	
air	
space	
.	

The	
plan	V.01
was	V.01
all	
set	V.08
and	
could	
have	V.01
succeeded	V.01
.	

But	
in	
fall	
of	
1999	
,	
Gen.	
Pervez	
Musharraf	
made	V.LV
a	
coup	V.01
against	
Nawaz	
Sharif	
.	

The	
Pakistani	
army	
was	V.01
rife	V.01
with	
elements	
protective	
of	
the	
Taliban	
,	
and	
the	
new	
military	
government	
reneged	V.01
on	
the	
deal	V.01
.	

Musharraf	
told	V.01
Clinton	
he	
could	
n't	
use	V.01
Pakistani	
soil	
or	
air	
space	
to	
send	V.02
the	
team	
in	
against	
Bin	
Laden	
.	

Look	V.01
at	
a	
map	
and	
you	
try	V.01
to	
figure	V.05
out	
how	
,	
in	
fall	
of	
1999	
,	
you	
could	
possibly	
pull	V.03
off	
such	
an	
operation	V.01
without	
Pakistani	
facilities	
.	

Of	
course	
,	
you	
could	
just	
go	V.02
in	
by	
main	
force	
.	

But	
for	
those	
of	
you	
tempted	V.01
in	
that	
direction	
,	
please	
look	V.05
up	
Carter	
's	
Tabas	
operation	V.01
.	

It	
should	
be	V.03
easily	
googled	V.01
.	

Clinton	
tried	V.01
,	
and	
tried	V.01
hard	
.	

The	
gods	
were	V.01
n't	
with	
us	
on	
that	
one	
.	

that	
is	V.01
how	
i	
want	V.01
you	
to	
refer	V.01
to	
me	
as	
"

n't	
think	V.01
so

i	
'm	V.01

of	
those

John	
,	

Hello	
from	
South	
America	
.	

I	
just	
got	V.01
your	
email	V.01
and	
I	
certainly	
concur	V.01
with	
Jeff	
making	V.LV
the	
call	V.02
.	

He	
has	V.01
maintained	V.01
a	
good	
relationship	V.03
with	
Mulva	
.	

This	
was	V.01
a	
risk	V.01
that	
we	
had	V.LV
but	
we	
did	V.01
have	V.LV
assurances	V.01
from	
Phillips	
regarding	
performance	V.02
.	

I	
do	V.01
n't	
know	V.01
how	
much	
it	
will	
help	V.01
however	
.	

Richard	
Harper	
and	
Mary	
Nell	
Browning	
may	
have	V.03
some	
ideas	
here	
but	
I	
am	V.01
sure	V.02
you	
've	V.01
already	
gone	V.06
through	
it	
with	
them	
.	

I

Well

Have	V.01
you	
seen	V.01
the

from	
the

conference	V.01
that	
he	
launched	V.01
today

I	
think	V.01
this	
is	V.01
actually	
a	
good	
thing	
--	
makes	V.02
our	
proposal	V.01
look	V.02
like	
a	
much	
more	
preferable	
alternative	
by

,	
makes	V.02
our	
support	V.01
in	
the

more	
important	V.01
,	
and	
sets	V.03

Hi

Well	
,	
would	
n't	
you	
know	V.01
it	
.	

I	
'm	V.03
not	
driving	V.01
tonite	
,	
but	
I	
bet	V.01
that	
we	
could	
hitch	V.01
a	
ride	V.01
back	
with	
Anil	
.	

I	
'm	V.01
not	
sure	V.02
,	
but	
I	
think	V.01
that	
he	
's	V.01
got	V.02
class	
tonite	
,	
too	
.	

I	
'll	
search	V.01
him	
out	
before	
class	
or	
after	
that	
break	V.19
and	
see	V.01
if	
I	
can	
set	V.03
it	
up	
.	

daily	
dose	
on	
enron	
-	

we	
are	V.01
finished	V.01
.	

i	
need	V.01
to	
now	
get	V.01
a	
job	
at	
house	
of	
pies	
b/c	
that	
is	V.01
the	
only	
way	
to	
pay	V.01
the	
bills	
.	

the	
economy	
is	V.01
down	
and	
when	
enron	
collapses	V.01
,	
the	
energy	
industry	
is	V.03
going	V.04
to	
be	V.01
in	
a	
world	
of	
hurt	
.	

not	
to	
mention	
the	
market	
is	V.03
going	V.04
to	
be	V.03
flooded	V.01
with	
enron	
folks	
.	

ca	
n't	
go	V.02
to	
any	
more	
lsu	
games	
unless	
i	
get	V.01
a	
free	
ticket	
.	

Since	
work	V.01
has	V.01
gone	V.01
to	
hell	
,	
I	
am	V.03
hoping	V.01
to	
find	V.01
some	
excitement	V.01
in	
the	
possibility	
that	
LSU	
may	
play	V.01
in	
the	
Cotton

(	
if	
Rohan	
"	
Alabama	
"	
Davey	
shows	V.02
up	
for	
the	
next	
3	
games

)	

However	
,	
do	V.01
not	
purchase	V.01
tickets	
until	
it	
is	V.01
a	
done	
deal	V.01

could

persuaded	V.01
you	
to	
give	V.01

blowing	V.06
up

Vince	
,	

We	
are	V.03
still	
trying	V.01
to	
work	V.01
the	
PSE	
swap	
transaction	V.01
,	
now	
that	
the	
forex	
desk	
has	V.01
been	V.01
able	V.01
to	
find	V.01
a	
fix	V.02
for	
CPI	
in	
the	
market	
.	

Further	
to	
my	
voicemail	
,	
our	
colleagues	
in	
credit	V.01
are	V.03
calculating	V.01
the	
reserve	
on	
the	
PSE	
swap	
.	

They	
are	V.03
currently	
using	V.01
9.5	
%	
fixed	V.03
based	
on	
the	
1	
year	
implied	V.01
volatility	
.	

Volatility	
of	
USD	
/	
DM	
has	V.01
been	V.01
in	
the	
range	
of	
between	
7	
%	
and	
11	
%	
.	

Can	
one	
of	
your	
research	
staff	
justify	V.01
a	
suitable	
20	
year	
volalatility	
number	
for	
USD	
/	
Euro	
.	

Ideally	
,	
we	
would	
like	V.01
a	
fast	
turnaround	
.	

In	
addition	V.02
,	
is	V.02
there	
someone	
who	
could	
consider	V.02
the	
correlation	V.01
between	
US	
CPI	
and	
the	
$	
/	
euro	
exchange	
rate	
.	

The	
credit	
guys	
are	V.03
currently	
assuming	V.02
that	
there	
is	V.02
no	
correlation	V.01
and	
may	
consequently	
be	V.03
double	
dipping	V.02
the	
credit	
reserve	
on	
this	
basis	
too	
.	

Grateful	
for	
any	
help	V.01
or	
suggestions	V.01
you	
could	
provide	V.01
.	

Sid	

Vincent

I	
met	V.02
you

I	
enjoyed	V.01
your

very	
much

I	
was	V.03
wondering	V.01
if	
you	
could	
give	V.01
me	
some	
references	V.01

the

I	
understand	V.01
you

Daren	
,	

I	
was	V.03
wondering	V.01
if	
it	
would	
be	V.01
OK	
for	
me	
to	
sit	V.05
in	
with	
you	
one	
day	
to	
get	V.01
a	
general	
feel	
of	
your	
end	
of	
the	
process	V.02
.	

Pat	
had	V.01
told	V.01
me	
before	
he	
left	V.11
that	
it	
would	
help	V.01
me	
better	
grasp	V.01
the	
process	V.02
as	
a	
whole	
.	

I	
understand	V.01
the	
imminent	
cold	
weather	
is	V.03
making	V.02
things	
crazy	V.03
,	
so	
now	
may	
not	
be	V.01
the	
best	
time	
to	
be	V.01
in	
your	
way	V.01
.	

But	
let	V.01
me	
know	V.01
if	
I	
can	
spend	V.02
a	
day	
,	
morning	
,	
or	
even	
just	
an	
afternoon	
down	
there	
with	
you	
whenever	
it	
is	V.01
a	
good	
time	
.	

I	
think	V.01
it	
will	
help	V.01
me	
very	
much	
in	
my	
role	
.	

Thanks	V.01

The	
Dow	
topped	V.05
out	
in	
February	
of	
1966	
at	
995	
.	

By	
September	
of	
that	
year	
the	
Dow	
had	V.01
tumbled	V.01
to	
744	
.	

The	
Dow	
then	
rallied	V.02
to	
a	
high	
of	
943	
in	
September	
of	
'67	
.	

By	
March	
of	
'68	
the	
Dow	
had	V.01
fallen	V.01
to	
825	
,	
only	
to	
climb	V.02
to	
a	
highly	
speculative	
peak	
of	
985	
in	
December	
of	
'68	
.	

The	
Dow	
then	
sank	V.01
to	
631	
in	
December	
of	
'70	
.	

By	
April	
of	
'71	
the	
Dow	
had	V.01
climbed	V.02
back	
to	
950	
,	
only	
to	
fall	V.01
to	
869	
in	
February	
of	
'72	
.	

A	
big	
rally	V.01
then	
took	V.01
the	
Dow	
(	
unconfirmed	
)	
to	
a	
record	
high	
of	
1051	
in	
January	
of	
'73	
,	
turning	V.02
everyone	
bullish	
.	

But	
by	
December	
of	
'73	
the	
Dow	
had	V.01
collapsed	V.02
to	
788	
.	

Think	V.01
that	
was	V.01
bad	V.07
-	
by	
December	
of	
'74	
the	
Dow	
had	V.01
sunk	V.01
to	
a	
bear	
market	
low	
of	
577	
.	

At	
that	
time	
,	
the	
gurus	
and	
geniuses	
of	
Wall	
Street	
were	V.03
predicting	V.01
a	
250	
Dow	
and	
many	
were	V.03
talking	V.01
openly	
about	
the	
end	V.01
of	
capitalism	
.	

Of	
course	
,	
that	
was	V.01
the	
bottom	

And	
that	
's	V.01
the	
way	V.01
the	
greatest	
bear	
market	
since	
the	
Depression	
worked	V.06
its	
way	V.01
down	
.	

By	
late	
1974	
investors	
were	V.01
dizzy	V.02
,	
they	
were	V.01
desperate	V.01
,	
they	
were	V.03
wrung	V.03
-	
out	
,	
they	
had	V.01
left	V.15
Wall	
Street	
,	
many	
for	
good	
.

we	
look	V.03

The	
results	
of	
the	
February	
26th	
PVT	
test	V.01
conducted	V.01
on	
Nville	
have	V.01
been	V.03
discussed	V.01
with	
each	
of	
you	
over	
the	
last	
three	
months	
.	

As	
we	
have	V.01
discussed	V.01
....	
effective	V.04
Sep	
13th	
,	
Anita	
will	
make	V.LV
the	
adjustments	V.01
to	
Enron	
's	
inventory	
and	
pad	
gas	
to	
reflect	V.01
the	
February	
26th	
results	
.	

I	
talked	V.01
with	
Gary	
Wilson	
,	
and	
he	
confirmed	V.01
that	
the	
revised	
values	
are	V.01
correct	V.02
.	

Attached	V.01
is	V.03
a	
spreadsheet	
that	
contains	V.01
the	
values	
.	

The	
correction	V.01
to	
the	
working	
gas	
includes	V.01
TWO	
corrections	V.01
.	

The	
results	
of	
the	
February	
26th	
test	V.01
reduces	V.01
the	
working	
gas	
by	
398,487	
MMBTU	
.	

In	
addition	V.02
,	
there	
is	V.02
a	
reduction	V.01
of	
22,101	
MMBTU	
which	
is	V.01
the	
difference	V.02
between	
the	
SCADA	
values	
(	
Best	
Available	
)	
that	
Anita	
showed	V.01
on	
the	
February	
29th	
Storage	
Sheet	
and	
the	
"	
official	
"	
February	
29th	
values	
that	
Gary	
Wilson	
received	V.01
from	
MIPS	
.	

To	
summarize	V.01
:	
Enron	
's	
pad	
gas	
will	
now	
be	V.01
3,993,310	
MMBTU	
,	
instead	
of	
4,223,000	
MMBTU	
.	

Enron	
's	
working	
gas	
will	
be	V.03
reduced	V.01
by	
420,588

that	
after	
friday	
and	
saturday	
she	
felt	V.02
i	
was	V.03
slowly	
regressing	V.01

then	
i	
told	V.01

screw	V.02

just

Lori

to	
think	V.01
I	
need	V.01
to	
get	V.LV
help	V.01
-	
I	
told	V.01
her	
it	
's	V.01
normal	V.02
to	
drink	V.01
all	
day	
at	
a	
bar	
,	
then	
go	V.02
to	
dinner	
where	
you	
do	V.01
n't	
know	V.02
half	
the	
people	
there	
and	
proceed	V.01
to	
get	V.03
extremely	
fucked	
up

thanks	V.01

I

about

few	
times

,	
did	V.01
n't	
want	V.01
to	
intrude	V.01
upon	
an	
already	
bad	
situation	
with	
my	
bullshit	
questions	
.	

I	
'm	V.03
hearing	V.01
some	
pretty	
depressing	
stuff	
from	
the	
people	
I	
know	V.01
at	
ENE	
.	

I	
wish	V.01
I	
had	V.03
the	
capital	
to	
open	V.01
my	
own	
shop	
?	

there	
will	
be	V.02
talent	
and	
opportunity	
a	
plenty	
on	
the	
market	
soon	
.	

I	
'll	
ask	V.01
around	
?	

I	
've	V.01
got	V.02
some	
friends	
at	
Duke	
and	
Dynegy	
from	
B

school	
,	
the	
Gianoucous	
(	
spelling	V.01
??	
)	
brothers	
(	
John	
and	
Dimitri	
?	
from	
elementary	
school	
)	
started	V.01
their	
own	
outfit	
a	
while	
back	
,	
and	
my	
old	
man	
is	V.01
at	
Schlumberger	
and	
has	V.03
good	
contacts	V.01
in	
general	
(	
if	
you	
are	V.01
n't	
married	V.01
to	
a	
trading	
environment	
)	
.	

Give	V.01
me	
a	
few	
days

Attached	V.01
are	V.03
clean	
and	
blacklined	
drafts	
of	
the	
Enron	
guaranties	V.01
to	
be	V.03
made	V.LV
in	
support	V.01
of	
EPMI	
's	
obligations	V.01
under	
the	
Indian	
Mesa	
II	
Renewable	
Energy	
Purchase	
Agreement	
(	
"	
PPA	
"	
)	
and	
Green	
Premium	
Sharing	
Agreement	
(	
"	
GSPA	
"	
)	
.?	

The	
guaranty	
for	
the	
PPA	
is	V.03
blacklined	V.01
against	
the	
Enron	
EPC	
Contract	
guaranty	
in	
favor	
of	
the	
banks	
which	
was	V.03
granted	V.01
in	
connection	V.01
with	
our	
Cabazon	
Wind	
Power	
Project	
(	
the	
project	
most	
recently	
financed	V.01
by	
EWC	
)	
and	
the	
GPSA	
guaranty	
is	V.03
blacklined	V.01
against	
the	
PPA	
guaranty	
.	

As	
we	
discussed	V.01
last	
week	
,	
since	
the	
Enron	
guaranties	
will	
need	V.01
to	
be	V.01
in	
a	
form	
that	
will	
acceptable	V.02
to	
our	
project	
lenders	
and	
equity	
participants	
,	
we	
thought	V.01
that	
we	
should	
start	V.01
with	
a	
form	
that	
was	V.03
used	V.01
in	
our	
last	
financing	V.02
and	
that	
was	V.03
negotiated	V.01
by	
Enron	
and	
the	
banks	
.	

We	
plan	V.01
to	
use	V.01
the	
same	
basic	
form	
for	
the	
Enron	
guaranty	V.01
that	
will	
be	V.03
made	V.LV
in	
favor	
of	
EPMI	
with	
respect	V.02
to	
the	
seller	
's	
obligations	V.01
under	
the	
PPA	
.	

We	
will	
forward	V.01
the	
draft	
of	
that	
guaranty	
to	
you	
later	
today	
.	

Please	
feel	V.01
free	V.04
to	
give	V.LV
me	
a	
call	V.02
if	
you	
have	V.LV
any	
questions	V.01
concerning	
the	
attached	
guaranties

Your

to	
introduce	V.02
the	
concept	
discussed	V.01
with	
one	
of	
the

is	V.03

this

at	
some	
level

The	
design	V.01
of	
the	
model

its	
potential	
economics	
could	
be	V.01
key	V.02
to	
how	
worthy	
the	
effort	V.01
might	
be	V.01

Enron	
could	
be	V.01
an	
ideal	
environment	
from	
which	
to	
the	
concept	
enhancement	
through	
to

I	
thought	V.01
that

he

be	V.01
good	V.02

His

it

for	
global	
domination	V.01
of

by

It

not

Hello	
there	

Action	
Network	
is	V.01
a	
BBC	
website	
for	
people	
who	
are	V.03
taking	V.LV
action	V.02
on	
issues	V.02
that	
concern	V.02
them	
.	

I	
'm	V.03
getting	V.03
in	
touch	V.01
because	
I	
think	V.01
it	
could	
be	V.01
useful	V.05
to	
people	
campaigning	V.01
about	
hospital	
closures	
.	

We	
've	V.01
got	V.02
a	
page	
dedicated	V.01
to	
issues	V.02
around	
hospitals	
(	
http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/C55153	
)	
and	
a	
group	
called	V.01
NHS	
SOS	
have	V.01
already	
put	V.11
up	
a	
campaign	V.01
about	
ward	
closures	
in	
Cumbria	
.	

I	
'm	V.03
hoping	V.01
to	
build	V.05
this	
up	
to	
be	V.01
a	
hub	
for	
all	
the	
campaigners	
-	
a	
place	
where	
people	
can	
exchange	V.01
ideas	
and	
advice	
.	

It	
would	
be	V.01
great	V.01
if	
the	
person	
from	
CHANT	
who	
started	V.01
this

would	
put	V.01
up	
a	
short	
description	V.01
of	
the	
campaign	V.01
and	
a	
list	
to	
this	
group	
page	
on	
the	
Action	
Network	
site	
.	

Action	
Network	
is	V.01
also	
a	
good	
place	
to	
post	V.01
details	
of	
events	
,	
or	
try	V.01
to	
rally	V.01
together	
a	
group	
if	
you	
want	V.01
to	
take	V.LV
action	V.02
in	
your	
area	
.	

You	
can	
attach	V.01
anything	
you

an

,	
"	
if	
my

was	V.03
playing	V.01
in

No

Winston

A

explains	V.01

,	
"	
that

The

none

asks	V.01

raises	V.01

In

Winston	
beams	V.02

can	
you

"	
Well	
,	
"	
says	V.01
the

"	
because	
it

Wise	
decision	V.01
to	
go	V.02
through	
the	
private	
sector	
--	
NASA	
's	
budget	
may	
be	V.01
kinda	
tight	V.04
to	
fund	V.01
a	
project	
like	
this	
.	

This	
group	
does	V.01
sound	V.01
pretty	
interesting	V.01
though	
.	

The	
Lunar	
Transporatation	
Systems	
(	
LTS	
)	
is	V.03
actually	
being	V.03
funded	V.01
by	
two	
space	
businessmen	
,	
Walter	
Kistler	
and	
Bob	
Citron	
.	

Both	
of	
these	
men	
are	V.01
heavily	
involved	V.01
in	
the	
private	
sector	
of	
the	
space	
industry	
,	
and	
both	
are	V.01
also	
involved	V.01
with	
another	
space	
company	
called	V.01
SPACEHAB	
.	

They	
want	V.01
to	
use	V.01
LTS	
to	
tie	V.01
into	
NASA	
's	
vision	
for	
Space	
Exploration	V.01
,	
and	
seem	V.01
pleased	V.01
that	
the	
White

is	V.03
moving	V.01
in	
that	
direction

"	
We	
are	V.01
so	
excited	V.01
that	
the	
White

and	
the	
recent	
new

policy	
underscores	V.01
the	
need	V.01
to	
involve	V.01
the	
private

in	
assisting	V.01
NASA	
develop	V.02
its

.	

With	
their	
proposal	V.01
of	
a	
"

"	
highway	
,	
it	
looks	V.02
like

U.S.	
astronauts	
will	
launch	V.01
to	
the	
moon	
on	
sleek	
,	
single	
,	
shuttle	
booster	
rockets	
and	
the	
first	
new	
upper	
-	
stage	
rocket	
this	
country	
has	V.01
developed	V.02
in	
more	
than	
a	
decade	
,	
NASA	
and	
the	
Pentagon	
have	V.01
told	V.01
the	
White	
House	
.	

Lunar	
landers	
and	
other	
gear	
needed	V.01
for	
extended	
visits	V.01
to	
the	
moon	
will	
be	V.03
lofted	V.01
by	
gargantuan	
launchers	
as	
big	
as	
the	
Apollo	
-	
era	
Saturn	
5	
,	
the	
most	
powerful	
rockets	
ever	
flown	V.01
.	

It	
looks	V.02
as	
if	
NASA	
is	V.03
transitioning	V.01
away	
from	
the	
shuttle	
model	
,	
as	
in	
the	
past	
they	
have	V.01
proven	V.01
to	
be	V.01
quite	
dangerous	V.01
as	
Columbia	
has	V.01
recently	
proved	V.01
.	

Although	
these	
new	
rockets	
are	V.01
probably	
more	
expensive	V.02
,	
they	
will	
be	V.01
able	V.01
to	
go	V.01
at	
a	
much	
greater	
range	
than	
it's	
shuttle	
cousins	
,	
as	
they	
can	
not	
only	
break	V.16
free	V.04
from	
the	
atmosphere	
but	
reach	V.01
the	
moon	
as	
well	
.	

"	
NASA	
will	
initiate	V.01
development	V.02
of	
a	
Crew	
Launch	V.01
Vehicle	
derived	V.01
from	
space	
shuttle	
solid	
rocket	
boosters	
with	
a	
new	
upper	
stage	
for	
human	
spaceflight	
,	
"	
said	V.01
the	
letter	
,	
signed	V.01
by	
NASA	
Administrator	
Mike	
Griffin	
and	
the	
Pentagon	
's	
top	
space	
official	
,	
ex-astronaut	
Ron	
Sega	
...	

"	
NASA	
then	
plans	V.01
to	
develop	V.02
a	
new	
100	
-	
metric	
-	
ton	
-	
class	
launch	
vehicle	
derived	V.01
from	
existing	
capabilities	
with	
the	
space	
shuttle	
external	
tanks	
and	
solid	
rocket	
boosters	
for	
future	
missions	V.01
to	
the	
moon	
,	
"	
the	
letter	
said	V.01
.	

NASA	
is	V.03
planning	V.01
on	
using	V.01
these	
new	
shuttles	
to	
replace	V.01
the	
current	
models	V.01
,	
with	
industry	
forecasters	
predicting	V.01
a	
launch	V.01
as	
early	
as	
2014	
.	

The	
new	
rocket	
design	V.01
will	
differ	V.02
slightly	
from	
it's	
predecessors	
,	
in	
the	
fact	
that	
the	
crew	
and	
cargo	
would	
launch	V.01
separately	
from	
two	
different	
rockets	
each	
and	
join	V.02
up	
in	
space	
later	
on	
.	

Launching	V.01
this	
way	V.01
will	
hopefully	
avoid	V.01
future	
disasters	
,	
giving	V.LV
more	
support	V.01
towards	
NASA	
revisiting	V.01
the	
stars	
.

I	
have	V.01
n't	
sailed	V.01

None

,	
it	
's	V.01
a	
toss	V.04

up	
between

NCL	
is	V.01
a

what

I	
ca	
nt	
find	V.01
any	
information	
about

When	
the	
French	
returned	V.01
to

at	
the	
end	V.01
of	
WW	
II	
the	
Viet

in

the

out

Is	V.01
that	
what	
you	
are	V.03

plz	
bring	V.01
your

to	
the

ASAP

esp	
if	
not	
eating	V.01
-	
if	
it	
had	V.01
only	
happened	V.01
once	
and	
could	
get	V.04
him	
to	
eat	V.01
right	
away	
-	
it	
could	
have	V.01
been	V.01
you	
missed	V.02
his	
meal	
time	
and	
he	
needed	V.01
to	
eat	V.01
-	
since	
it	
sounds	V.01
like	
it	
has	V.01
happened	V.01
several	
times	
over	
two	
days	
-	
then	
he	
may	
have	V.01
gotten	V.03
int	
to	
something	
that	
needs	V.01
to	
be	V.03
attended	V.01

RIGHT

why	
are	V.02
there	
two	
statues	
of	
David	
?	

i	
doing	V.02
a	
research	
paper	
on	
donatello	
and	
i	
notice	V.01
that	
there	
are	V.02
two	
statues	
of	
David	
,	
a	
bronze	
one	
and	
marble	
one	
.	

Michelangelo	
made	V.01
the	
marble	
one	
but	
why	
did	V.01
he	
do	V.02
another	
if	
Donatello	
had	V.01
already	
made	V.01
one	
?	

so	
i	
m	V.01
a	
little	
confused	V.01
,	
why	
is	V.02
there	
two	
statues	
of	
David	
?	

different	
generations	
,	
the	
donatello	
is	V.01
of	
a	
boy	
david	
as	
a	
young	
sheep	
Herder	
,	
the	
Michelangelo	
is	V.01
the	
grown	
up	
man	
david	
as	
slayer	
and	
king	

Because	
he	
liked	V.01
making	V.01
statues	
of	
David	
!	
:D	

Obviously	
,	
he	
should	
have	V.01
been	V.03
arrested	V.01
and	
jailed	V.01
-	
imagine	V.01
making	V.01
a	
statue	
or	
painting	
on	
the	
same	
subject	
as	
another	
artist	
-	
clearly	
insulting	
and	
disrespecting	
-	
wasted	
time	
that	
could	
have	V.01
been	V.03
used	V.01
making	V.01
a	
statue	
with	
clothes	
on

Name	
of	
specific	
Hibachi	
restaurant	
in	
Chicago	
?	

I	
have	V.03
a	
friend	
out	
in	
Chicago	
this	
week	
,	
and	
I	
am	V.03
trying	V.01
to	
remember	V.01
the	
name	
of	
an	
awesome	
hibachi	
style	
restaurant	
i	
visited	V.01
while	
out	
there	
a	
couple	
years	
ago	
.	

I	
think	V.01
it	
was	V.01
in	
the	
Lincoln	
Square	
area	
but	
do	V.01
n't	
quote	V.01
me	
on	
that	
.	

It's	
'	
gimmick	
'	
was	V.01
that	
you	
fill	V.01
your	
bowl	
cafeteria	
-	
style	
from	
raw	
ingredients	
and	
leave	V.12
it	
on	
the	
counter	
with	
a	
chopstick	
listing	V.01
your	
table	
number	
on	
it	
.	

Four	
guys	
around	
a	
large	
square	
open	
hibachi	
cook	V.01
your	
food	
,	
and	
when	
it	
's	V.03
finished	V.01
a	
server	
brings	V.01
it	
to	
your	
table	
.	

All	
-	
you	
can	
-	
eat	V.01
style	
deal	V.01
.	

It	
was	V.01
pretty	
epic	
as	
I	
remember	V.01
and	
would	
love	V.02
to	
send	V.01
my	
friend	
there	
.

What	
's	V.01
the	
best	
time	
to	
start	V.01
a	
trip	V.03
around	
the	
world	
?	

Well	
,	
I	
'm	V.01
about	
to	
graduate	V.01
in	
less	
then	
a	
year	
,	
and	
I	
'm	V.03
planning	V.01
to	
study	V.01
medical	
school	
.	

But	
since	
in	
my	
country	
it	
lasts	V.01
for	
minimum	
6	
years	
,	
and	
I	
want	V.01
to	
go	V.02
aground	
the	
world	
,	
what	
do	V.01
you	
think	V.01
,	
should	
I	
do	V.02
it	
before	
or	
after	
medical	
school	
?	

If	
you	
can	
afford	V.01
to	
go	V.02
before	
,	
then	
by	
all	
means	
,	
GO	V.02
.	

If	
you	
have	V.02
to	
wait	V.01
,	
due	
to	
financial	
reasons	
,	
then	
wait	V.01
.	

I	
would	
much	
rather	
put	V.06
it	
off	
until	
I	
can	
afford	V.01
to	
have	V.LV
the	
vacation	V.01
of	
a	
lifetime	
as	
I	
'm	V.01
sure	V.02
this	
trip	V.03
is	V.03
intended	V.01
to	
be	V.01
.	

Airfare	
alone	
will	
be	V.01
incredibly	
expensive	V.02
so	
make	V.02
sure	V.01
you	
have	V.03
the	
money	
and	
of	
course	
free	
time	
to	
take	V.01
your	
time	
and	
have	V.03
a	
great	
time	
.

My

times	
as	
in

but	
the

not

the

only	
begins	V.02
to	
work	V.09
again	
when	
i	
take	V.11
out	
the	
battery	
and	
put	V.01
it	
back	
in	
.	

did	V.01
anyone	
have	V.LV
this	
issue	V.02
?	

is	V.01
it	
worthy	V.02
to	
send	V.01
in	
for	
warranty	
repair	V.01
?	

thanks	V.01
!	

Sounds	V.01
simple	V.02
enough	V.01
to	
me	
.	

Your	
camera	
is	V.03
n't	
acting	V.01
normally	
,	
you	
got	V.01
warranty	
,	
let	V.01
Canon	
deal	V.01
with	
it	
.	

I	
would	
agree	V.01
.	

I	
shoot	V.03
a	
t1i	
and	
have	V.01
n't	
had	V.LV
such	
an	
issue	V.02
.	

I	
also	
agree	V.01
it	
's	V.01
under	
warranty	
so	
get	V.03
in	
touch	V.01
with	
Canon	
.	

It	
sounds	V.01
like	
a	
firmware	
issue	V.02
and	
the	
camera	
requires	V.01
a	
re-boot	
just	
like	
what	
happens	V.01
in	
a	
computer	
-	
needs	V.01
a	
re-start	
from	
time	
to	
time	
but	
it	
should	
n't	
be	V.03
happening	V.01
in	
a

I	
used	V.01

What	
is	V.01

I	
just

I	
'm	V.03
wondering	V.01
if	
there	
's	V.02

I	
usually	
use	V.01
ZebraKlub

They	
basically	
buy	V.01
daily	
deals	V.01
from	
Groupon	
,	
Living	
Social	
,	
and	
all	
sorts	
of	
other

So	
you	
can	
pretty	
much	
get	V.01
whatever	
deal	V.01
you	
want	V.01
anytime	
.	

Most	
of	
the	
deals	V.01
let	V.01
you	
eat	V.01
for	
500	
ff	
,	
and	
some	
of	
the	
deals	V.01
are	V.01
even	
free	V.03
.	

If	
you	
want	V.01
to	
eat	V.01
cheaply	
without	
worrying	V.02
about	
all	
those	
daily	
deal	
emails	V.01
every

ZebraKlub	
should	
be	V.01

May	
seem	V.01
a

,	
taking	V.LV
a	
long	
ride	V.01
on	
the	
Metra	
system	
or	
the	
"	
L	
"	
system	
is	V.01

great	
way	V.01
to	
see	V.01
the

sites	
without	
spending	V.01
a

I

cichlids

Possibly	
a	
freshwater	
tank	
with	
a	
ton	
of	
different	
species	
in	
there

I	
've	V.01
never	
kept	V.01
cichlids

I	
know	V.01
saltwater	
is	V.01
a	
possibility	
,	
can	
you	
give	V.01
me	
a	
possible	
stocking	
option	
for	
that	
too

I	
'll	
choose	V.01
the	
one	
that	
sounds	V.01
the	
best	
after	
looking	V.01

all

Best	
Electrician	
in	
Florence	

I	
have	V.01
been	V.03
using	V.01
Steele	
Electric	
for	
years

They	
have	V.01
always	
done	V.02
a	
great	
job	
at	
a	
reasonable	
price	V.01
.	

Highly	
recommended	V.01
.	

Not	
impressed	
.	

Overpriced	
and	
the	
doctor	
acted	V.01
arrogant	V.01
and	
rushed	V.01
at	
a	
time	
when	
there	
was	V.02
very	
few	
clients	
in	
the	
facility	
.	

I	
wo	
n't	
return	V.01

A	
thoroughly	
comprehensive	
service	V.01
;	
excellent	
communication	V.01
and	
best	
of	
they	
are	V.01
transparent	V.01
with	
their	
fee	
(	
ie	
nothing	
is	V.03
simply	
implied	V.01
or	
assumed	V.02
)	
.	

I	
gave	V.01
Dr.	
Rohatgi	
2	
stars	
because	
her	
assistant	
was	V.01
very	
pleasant	V.02
.	

However	
,	
I	
did	V.01
not	
find	V.02
her	
very	
helpful	V.04
and	
her	
receptionist	
was	V.01
rude	V.01

Extremely	
greasy

Hit	V.07

I	
never

the

This	
is	V.01
a	
great

I	
've	V.01

a

and	
love	V.01
the

why

would	
you

that	
has	V.03
the

is	V.02
there	
something	
behind	
the

at	
this

Like	
I	
'm	V.01
legitimately	
concerned	V.01
at	
this

Fresh	
and	
Excellent	
Quality	

We	
order	V.02
take	
out	
from	
here	
all	
the	
time	
and	
we	
are	V.01
never	
disappointed	
.	

The	
food	
is	V.01
always	
fresh	V.04
and	
delicious	V.01
.	

It	
can	
be	V.01
a	
little	
on	
the	
spicy	
side	
but	
just	
ask	V.02
them	
exactly	
what	
you	
want	V.01
and	
they	
are	V.01
very	
helpful	V.04
.	

I	
really	
want	V.01
to	
like	V.01
this	
place	
since	
I	
work	V.01
right	
around	
the	
corner	
.	

Unfortunately	
,	
I	
've	V.01
given	V.LV
it	
a	
couple	
of	
tries	V.01
at	
different	
times	
and	
decided	V.01
to	
stop	V.01
going	V.02
.	

The	
employees	
do	V.01
n't	
really	
seem	V.01
to	
enjoy	V.01
what	
they	
are	V.03
doing	V.02
and	
it	
shows	V.01
.	

Class	
act	
.	

It	
was	V.01
late	V.01
in	
the	
day	
and	
I	
was	V.01
worried	V.01
I	
would	
get	V.03
charged	V.01
an	
arm	
and	
a	
leg	
and	
have	V.02
to	
wait	V.01
forever	
.	

They	
picked	V.04
my	
car	
up	
in	
Yarmouth	
and	
towed	V.01
to	
Bath	
for	
a	
great	
price	V.01

Would	
do	V.02
business	
with	
them	
again

They	
walked	V.01
me	
through	
all	
the	
steps	V.01
involved	
in	
the	
the	
installation	
project	
so	
that	
there	
were	V.02
no

management	V.01
changes	V.02

frequently

the	
service	V.01
has	V.01
been	V.01

"

which	
sometimes	
is	V.03

Thanks	V.01

Michael	
helped	V.01
shoot	V.03
the	
majority	
of	
my	
firm	
's	
website	
and	
we	
could	
not	
have	V.01
been	V.01
happier	V.01
.	

We	
went	V.02
through	
six	
photographers	
to	
find	V.01
the	
right	
photographers	
that	
would	
represent	V.01
our	
firm	
in	
the	
light	
we	
wished	V.01
to	
and	
Michael	
and	
his	
team	
made	V.02
that	
happen	V.01
.	

He	
's	V.01
worth	V.02
every	
penny	
.	

Average	
food	
and	
deathly	
slow	
service	V.02

I	
have	V.01
eaten	V.01
here	
several	
times	
and	
every	
time	
the	
service	V.02
is	V.01
slower	V.05
than	
slow	
.	

One	
time	
we	
even	
left	V.11
after	
sitting	V.01
at	
the	
table	
for	
20	
minutes	
and	
not	
being	V.03
greeted	V.01
with	
a	
drink	
order	V.02
.	

Ridiculous	
.	

There	
must	
be	V.02
a	
better	
mexican	
place	
in	
Rockland	
.	

I	
am	V.01
in	
love	V.01
with	
the	
giant	
plate	
of	
nachos	
!	

Last	
time	
I	
went	V.02
however	
,	
my	
beer	
was	V.01
warm	V.07
and	
the	
service	V.02
was	V.01
so	
-	
so	
.	

I	
get	V.01
that	
careless	
teenager	
kind	
of	
treatment	V.01
from	
some	
of	
their	
staff	
...	
perhaps	
they	
should	
hire	V.01
more	
serious	
adults	
to	
help	V.01
serve	V.02
/	
cook	V.01
.	

nice	
friendly	
local	
bagel	
place	

there	
might	
be	V.02
bigger	
and	
more	
well	
known	
bagel	
places	
in	
the	
area	
but	
Family	
Bagels	
are	V.01
nice	
people	
,	
small	
shop	
and	
incredibly	
friendly	
.	

While	
other	
may	
be	V.01
ok	
waiting	V.01
in	
line	
at	
Town	
Bagel	
we	
are	V.01
happy	V.01
with	
the	
quality	
and	
service	V.02
we	
get	V.01
at	
Family	
Bagels	

Very	
Mediocre	
donuts	
!	

The	
Donuts	
were	V.01
very	
over	
proofed	
,	
making	V.02
them	
stale	
and	
bready	
.	

The	
service	V.02
was	V.01
friendly	V.01
and	
fast	V.02
,	
but	
this	
just	
does	V.01
nt	
make	V.16
up	
for	
the	
lack	
-	
luster	
product	
.	

We	
tried	V.01
4	
different	
style	
of	
donuts	
,	
they	
were	V.01
all	
the	
same	
when	
it	
came	V.12
to	
quality	
.	

a	
staple	
!	

I	
live	V.01
in	
the	
neighborhood	
and	
this	
place	
is	V.01
one	
of	
my	
favorites	
for	
a	
tasty	
,	
quick	
and	
inexpensive	
meal	
.	

Branch	V.02
out	
and	
try	V.01
something	
other	
than	
the	
Pad	
Thai	
,	
the	
curries	
are	V.01
fantastic	V.02
.	

Fast	
and	
friendly	
service	V.02
,	
they	
know	V.01
my	
order	V.02
when	
I	
walk	V.01
in	
the	
door	
!	

On	
time	
,	
Clean	
and	
very	
nice	

I	
called	V.02
over	
the	
weekend	
due	
to	
clogged	V.02
kitchen	
sink	
.	

Scheduled	V.01
appointment	V.02
for	
8:30	
Monday	
morning	
.	

Rich	
was	V.01
here	
before	
the	
scheduled	
time	
.	

He	
was	V.01
very	
clean	V.04
,	
very	
nice	
to	
work	V.01
with	
and	
gave	V.01
a	
very	
reasonable	
price	V.01
.	

HIGHLY	
recommend	V.01
.	

thanks	V.01

massage	
which	
has	V.01
significantly	
reduced	V.01
the

flexibility	
and	
movement	V.01
