Let*  
me  >ARG0
join*  
the  
chorus*  
of  
annoyance  <ARG1
over  
Google  
's  
new  
toolbar  >>ARG0

which  >>R-ARG0

as  
noted*  >>ARGM-ADV

commits*  
just  
about

and  
makes*  
up  
a  
few  
new  
ones  <ARG1
besides  <ARGM-ADV

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
fond*  
of  
the  
Google  >ARG0

hates*  >ARG1

privacy  <ARG1

(  
You  >>ARG0

out  <ARGM-PRD

if  
--

you  >>ARG1

However  >ARGM-ADV
,  
this

really  
bad  
news  <ARG2
.  

On  
the  
other  
hand  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
it  >>ARG1
looks*  
pretty  >ARGM-ADV
cool*  
.  

Iran  >ARG0
says*  
it  >>ARG0
is*  
creating*  
nuclear  
energy  <ARG1
without  
wanting*  
nuclear  
weapons  <ARG1
.  

The  
United  
States  >>ARG0
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
believe*  
the  
Iranian  
Government  <ARG1
.  

One  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
suspect*  
the  
Iranian  
Government  <ARG2
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
there  
is*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
proof*  
.  

I  >ARG0
read*  
an  
Article  >ARG0
in  
Time  
magazine  
accusing*  
the  
Iranian  
Government  >>ARG0
of  
being*  
willing*  
to  
start*  
a  
nuclear  >ARGM-ADJ
war*  
and  
I  >ARG0
sympathise*  
with  
the  
Article  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
are*  
certainly  >>ARGM-ADV
being*  
nasty*  
to  
the  
United  
Nations  
Security  
Council  <ARG2
in  
connection*  
with  
the  
anti-proliferation  
treaty  <ARG2
.  

The  
President  >>ARG0
has*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
said*  
he  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
see*  
Israel  >ARG1
wiped*  
off  
the  
map  <ARG2
which  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
begin*  
to  
try*  
without  
nuclear  
weapons  <ARGM-MNR
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
he  >>ARG0
has*  
insisted*  
that  
he  >ARG0
wants*  
nuclear  
power  <ARG1
for  
peaceful  
purposes  <ARGM-PRP
.  

Many  
people  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
use*  
diplomacy  <ARG1
with  
Iran  <ARGM-GOL
rather  
than  
military  
pressure  <ARGM-ADV
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
will  >ARGM-MOD
diplomacy  >ARG1
work*  
?  

And  >ARGM-DIS
can  >ARGM-MOD
anyone  >ARG0
use*  
military  
pressure  <ARG1
without  
proof*  
?  

One  
reader  >ARG0
pointed*  
out  
that  
the  
President  >ARG0
watched*  
the  
Americans  <ARG1
in  
the  
embassy  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
took*  
them  
hostage  <ARG2
.  

He  >>ARG0
has*  
denied*  
this  <ARG1
.  

We  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  
have*  
to  
believe*  
him  <ARG1
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
we  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
prove*  
it  <ARG1
.  

It  
does*  
seem*  
that  
Iranians  >>ARG0
frequently  >>ARGM-TMP
make*  >ARGM-LVB
statements*  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
hide*  
behind  
lack*  
of  
proof*  
.

out  
of

completely  
.  

I  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
go*  
to  
the  
BBC  <ARG4
for  
this  
report*  
.  

It  
's*  
symptomatic*  
,  
I  >ARG0
suppose*  
,  
of  
our  
fast  
-  
paced  
,  
24  
hour  
news  
-  
cycle  
lives  <<ARG1
,  
that  
the  
biggest  
short

term  
humanitarian  
crisis  >>ARG1

world  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
quickly  >>ARGM-MNR
be*  
eclipsed*  
,  
once  
our

finished*  
with  
his  >ARG0
whirlwind  >ARGM-ADJ

,  
from  
the  
newspapers  <<ARGM-LOC

It  >>ARG1
's*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
disappointing*  
.  

Most  
troubling  >ARG1
,  
however  >ARGM-DIS
,  
is*  
the  
fact  <ARG2
that  
the  
political  
will  >>ARG1
to  
end*  
the  
crisis  <ARG1
expressed*  
a  
few  
short  
weeks  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
seems*  
to  
have*  
ebbed*  
.  

At  
that  
time  >ARGM-TMP
,  
UN  
Secretary  
General

demanded*  
steps*  >>ARG0

ethnic  
violence  <ARG1

Darfur

48  
hours  <ARGM-TMP

Two  
weeks  
later

and  
the  
violence  >ARG1

The

clearly  <ARGM-ADV

up  
to  
the

the  
peace*  
,  
pledging*  
300  
troops  <ARG1
to  
an  
area  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
15,000  <ARG1
,  
according  
to  
analysts  <ARGM-ADV
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
international  
donors  >>ARG0
have*  
given*  
only  
half  <ARG1
of  
the  
relief  >ARG1
aid*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
Darfur  >ARG0
needs*  
,  
according  
to  
the  
local  
UN  
officials  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
hear  >ARG2
we  >ARG1
are*  
,  
two  
weeks  
later  <ARGM-TMP
,  
after  
that  
dazzling  >ARGM-MNR
PR  >ARGM-PRP
display*  
two  
weeks  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
by  
Powell  <ARG0
and  
Annan  
,  
and  
the  
situation  >>ARG1
on  
the  
ground  
in  
Darfur  
appears*  
basically  >ARGM-ADV
unchanged*  
.  

Warren  >>ARG0
Buffett  
is*  
giving*  
away  
85  
%  <ARG1
of  
his  
wealth  
,  
mostly  
to  
the  
Bill  
and  
Melinda  
Gates  
Foundation  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
a  
move*  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
really  >ARGM-EXT
worries*  
me  <ARG1
;  
Buffett  >ARG0
's  
usual  >ARGM-ADJ
justification*  >>ARG1
for  
keeping*  
most  <ARG1
of  
his  
money  
was*  
that  
he  >>ARG0
was*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
compounding*  
the  
value  <ARG1
of  
his  
fortune  
at  
a  
pretty  
high  
rate  <ARGM-MNR
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
any  
gifts  >ARG1
now  
would  >ARGM-MOD
mean*  
significantly  
less  
money  <ARG2
for  
the  
foundation  
later  
.  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
hard*  
to  
parse*  
,  
but  
at  
this  
point  >>ARGM-TMP
his  >ARG0
ostensible  >ARGM-ADJ
view*  >ARG1
is*  
that  
the  
Gateses  >ARG1
are*  
very  
good  
money  
-  
redistributors  <ARG2
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
wants*  
them  >ARG0
to  
have*  
the  
money  <ARG1
as  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
as  
possible  
.  

Which  >ARG1
essentially  >ARGM-ADV
sounds*  
like  
he  >>ARG1
's*  
worried*  
that  
Bill  >>ARG1
or  
Melinda  
are*  
going*  
to  
die*  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
assume*  
his  
actual  
reason  >ARG1
is*  
that  
he  >>ARG1
's*  
worried*  
that  
Berkshire  
Hathaway  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-DIS
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
grow*  
quickly  
enough  <ARGM-TMP
to  
justify*  
his  
usual  
charity  
policy  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
the  
market  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
react*  
.  

It  >>ARG0
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
change*  
the  
company  
's  
intrinsic  
worth  <ARG1
,  
and  
as  
the  
article  >ARG0
notes*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
company  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
added*  
to  
a  
major  
index  <ARG2
once  
the  
shares*  >ARG1
get*  
more  <ARG2
liquid  <ARG2
.  

On  
the  
other  
hand  >ARGM-ADV
,  
this  >ARG1
is*  
essentially  <ARGM-ADV
a  
statement*  
that  
the  
company  >ARG1
is*  
overpriced  <ARG2
from  
the  
guy  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG1
knows*  
it  <ARG1
best  <ARGM-EXT
--  
and  
happens*  
to  
be*  
the  
best  
investor  <ARG2
of  
the  
last  
century  
.  

em  >ARGM-DIS
...  
no  >ARGM-DIS
...  
the  
Gates  
foundation  >ARG0
mainly  >ARGM-ADV
invests*  
in  
medical  >ARG1
research*  
and  
education*  
,  
that  >ARG1
means*  
donating*  >ARG0
now  <ARGM-TMP
adds*  
a  
tremendous  
value  <ARG1
compared  
to  
donating*  
in  
ten  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Because  
the  
10.000.000  
people  >>ARG1
dying*  
from  
malaria  <ARGM-CAU
will  >ARGM-MOD
otherwise  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
dead  <ARG2
.  

i.e  
.  

He  >>ARG0
's*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
giving*  
85  
%  <ARG1
away  <C-V
,  
he  >>ARG0
's*  
giving*  
a  
number  >>ARG1
of  
shares*  
each  
year  <<ARGM-TMP
that  >R-ARG1
decrease*  
in  
number  <ARGM-MNR
at  
the  
rate  <ARG2
of  
5  
%  
a  
year  
(  
until  
gone  <ARGM-TMP
?  
)  
.  

He  >ARG0
mentions*  
his  
wife  >ARG1
's  
death*  >>ARG0
having*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
effect*  
on  
him  <ARG1
.  

It  
sounds*  
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
rational*  
that  
he  >>ARG0
's*  
saying*  
that  
Bill  >ARG1
and  
Melinda  
are*  
at  
a  
prime  
spot  <ARG2
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
starting*  >ARG1
the  
money  
hose  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
is*  
a  
good  
idea  <ARG2
,  
but  
Buffet  >>ARG0
is*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
keeping*  
most  <ARG1
of  
his  >ARG0
donation*  
inside  
of  
Berkshire  >ARGM-LOC
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
compound*  
.  

Bill  >ARG0

The  
Fourth

an  
excellent  
essay  <ARG1
on  
how  >>ARGM-MNR

MSM  >>ARG0
and  
the  
UN  
,  
even  
the  
leftist  
countries  
in  
Europe  
,  
are*  
basically  >ARGM-ADV
accepting*  
terrorist  
organizations  <ARG1
as  
legitimate  
forms  <ARG3
of  
a  
political  
party  
:  

On  
the  
same  
day  >>ARGM-TMP
Palestinians  >ARG0
protest*  
in  
support*  
of  
Hezbollah  <ARG1
and  
Syria  
,  
the  
terrorist  
group  >>ARG0

has*  
indicated*  
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
participate*  
in  
the  
scheduled  >ARGM-PRD
upcoming  >ARGM-TMP
Parliamentary  >ARG2
elections*  
.  

To  
the  
north  >ARGM-LOC
in  
Lebanon  >ARGM-LOC
,  
there  
is*  
serious  >ARGM-MNR
debate*  
within  
Hezbollah  <ARG0
about  
entering*  
the  
Lebanese  >ARG0
political  >ARG1
process*  
in  
light  <<ARGM-ADV
of  
Syria  >ARG0
's  
promised  >ARGM-ADJ
withdrawal*  
.  

Syria  >>ARG0
has*  
agreed*  
to  
withdraw*  
under  
the  
conditions  >ARG1
set*  
forth  <ARGM-ADV
in  
UNSC  
Resolution  >>ARG1
1559  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
has*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
begun*  
.  

UN  
Secretary  
-  
General  
Kofi  >>ARG0
Annan  
has*  
indicated*  
it  >ARG1
is*  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
"  
recognize*  
Hezbollah  <ARG1
"  
after  
easily  >>ARGM-ADV
being*  
duped*  
by  
"  
the  
message  <ARG0
on  
the  
placards  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
are*  
using*  
"  
.  

This  
acceptance*  >>ARG1
of  
blatantly  
terrorist  
groups  <ARG1
as  
legitimate  >ARGM-ADJ
freedom  >ARG1
movements*  
is*  
a  
cancerous  
tumor  <ARG2
on  
the  
United  
Nations  
and  
the  
media  
.  

Over  
three  
years  
after  
9-11  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
United  
Nations  >>ARG0
,  
despite  
their  >ARG0
attempts*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
project*  
strength  <ARG1
in  
fighting*  
terrorism  <ARG1
,  
still  >ARGM-TMP
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
properly  >ARGM-MNR
define*  
the  
word  <ARG1
"  
terrorist  
"  
,  
waffling*  
over  
the  
issue*  
of  
whether  
the  
murder*  >ARG1
of  
innocent  
civilians  <ARG1
are*  
terrorist  
acts  <ARG2
.  

The  
media  >ARG0
routinely  >ARGM-TMP
obscures*  
the  
lines  <ARG1
between  
terrorism  
and  
legitimate  >ARGM-ADJ
resistance*  
,  
as  
the  
recent  
article  >ARG0
by  
Daniel  
Okrent  
of  
The  
New  
York  
Times  
demonstrates*  
.  

...  

The  
decision*  >>ARG0
to  
sidestep*  
the  
obvious  <ARG1
to  
satisfy*  
the  
need*  
to  
avoid*  
confrontation*  
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
bring*  
peace*  
,  
but  
only  >ARGM-ADV
delays*  
the  
eventual  >ARGM-TMP
conflict*  
as  
the  
predators  >ARG0
of  
Hamas  
and  
Hezbollah  
exploit*  
the  
inherent  
weakness  <ARG1
of  
the  
internationals  
and  
the  
media  
.  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
been*  
fuming*  
over  
this  
fact  <ARG1
for  
a  
few  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
ever  
since  
some  
organizations  >ARG0
and  
governments  
suggested*  
we  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
accept*  
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
Hezbollah  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
get*  
involved*  
in  
running*  
Lebanon  <ARG1
.  

Wtf  >ARG2
is*  
this  <ARG1
?  

This  >>ARG1
is*  
a  
terrorist  
organization  <ARG2
plain*  
and  
simple*  
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
the  
organization  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
bombed*  
our  
Marine  
barracks  <ARG1
in  
1983  <ARGM-TMP
,  
took*  
Americans  
hostage  <ARG2
throughout  
the  
80's  <ARGM-TMP
and  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
they  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
considered*  
a  
legitimate  
organization  <ARG1
?  

This  >ARG1
is*  
just  
another  
reason  <ARG2
to  
never  >ARGM-NEG
trust*  
the  
MSM  <ARG1
,  
and  
certainly  
not  
the  
Europeans  
.  

The  
Iraqi  
Islamic  
Party  >>ARG1
lead*  
by  
Muhsin  <ARG0
Abdul  
Hamid  
,  
has*  
been*  
among  
the  
few  
Sunni  
Muslim  
groups  <ARG2
willing  
to  
cooperate*  
(  
even  
if  
rather  
lukewarmly  
)  
with  
the  
Americans  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
is*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
threatening*  
to  
pull*  
out  
of  
the  
Allawi  
caretaker  
government  <ARG2
.  

The  
IIP  >>ARG1
had*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
been*  
the  
main  
force  >ARG0
urging*  
Sunni  
Arabs  >ARG0
to  
participate*  
in  
the  
elections*  >ARG1
scheduled*  
for  
January  <ARG3
,  
and  
had*  
been*  
opposed*  
in  
this  
stance*  
by  
the  
Association  <<ARG0
of  
Muslim  
Scholars  
.  

That  
the  
Iraqi  
Islamic  
Party  >>ARG0
is*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
contemplating*  >>ARG0
leaving*  
the  
Allawi  <ARG1

raises*  
the  
question*  
of  
whether  
a  
mass  >ARGM-ADJ
Sunni  >ARG0
Arab  >ARG0
boycott*  >>ARG1
of  
the  
elections*  
is*  
in  
the  
offing  <ARG2
,  
thus  >ARGM-ADV
fatally  >ARGM-ADV
weakening*  
the  
legitimacy  <ARG1

it  >ARG1

than  
it  >>ARG1

.  

On  
the  
internet  
site  >ARGM-LOC
of  
Monotheism  
and  
Holy  
War  
(  
al  
-  
Tawhid

)  
,  
the  
group  >ARG0

,  
"  
We  >ARG0

that

its

,  
have*

allegiance  <ARG2
to  
the  
sheikh  <ARG1
of  
the  
mujahideen  
Osama  
bin  
Laden  
.  
"  

This  
pledge  >>ARG1
is*  
a  
new  >ARGM-TMP
development*  
.  

Abu  >>ARG1
Musab  
al  
-  
Zarqawi  
and  
his  
group  
are*  
said*  
to  
have*  
been*  
bitter  
rivals  <ARG2
of  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
during  
the  
Afghan  
resistance  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

One  
witness  >>ARG0
at  
the  
Moutasaddiq  >ARG1
trial*  
in  
Germany  <ARGM-LOC
alleged*  
that  
Zarqawi  >>ARG0
had*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
allowed*  
Monotheism  >ARG0
and  
Holy  
War  
to  
share*  
resources  <ARG1
with  
al  
-  
Qaeda  <ARG2
in  
the  
early  
zeroes  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
21st  
century  
.  

If  
the  
statement*  >>ARG1
is*  
true*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
it  >ARG1
is*  
a  
worrying  >ARGM-ADJ
sign*  
that  
even  
the  
divided  
small  
radical  
guerrilla  
groups  >>ARG1
are*  
being*  
"  
picked*  
up  
"  
by  
al  
-  
Qaeda  <ARG0
.  

This  
consolidation*  >ARG1
is*  
obviously  <ARGM-ADV
a  
result  <ARG2
of  
Bush  >ARG0
's  
aggressive  >ARGM-MNR
invasion*  
of  
Iraq  <ARG1
and  
of  
the  
botching*  
of  
the  
aftermath  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
a  
setback  <ARG2
for  
the  
war*  
on  
terror  <ARG2
.  

Al  
-  
Qaeda  >ARG1
in  
Afghanistan  
was*  
a  
group  <ARG2
of  
only  
a  
few  
hundred  
"  
Afghan  
Arabs  >ARG0
"  
who  >R-ARG0
pledged*  
personal  
loyalty  <ARG2
to  
Usamah  <ARG1
Bin  
Laden  
.  

It  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
notionally  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
expanded*  
to  
encompass*  
the  
5,000  
-  
strong  
"  
55th  
Brigade  <ARG1
"  
of  
the  
Taliban  
regime  
,  
though  
this  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
technical  >ARGM-ADJ
definition*  
.  

Because  
Usamah  >ARG1
is*  
Saudi  >>ARGM-CAU
,  
my  >ARG0
guess*  >ARG1
is*  
that  
they  >>ARG1
were*  
especially  >ARGM-EXT
influenced*  
by  
an  
extremist  
form  <ARG0
of  
the  
Wahhabi  
school  >ARG1
of  
Islam  
that  >R-ARG1
predominates*  
among  
Saudia  
's  
some  
15  
million  
citizens  <ARG2
.  

In  
1998  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG1
were*  
joined*  
by  
Egyptians  <ARG0
from  
the  
al  
-  
Jihad  
al  
-  
Islami  
group  
of  
Ayman  
al  
-  
Zawahiri  
(  
many  >ARG1
of  
these  
were*  
from  
Upper  
Egypt  <ARG2
,  
especially  
Asyut  
and  
environs  
)  
.  

After  
that  
point  >ARGM-TMP
,  
al  
-  
Qaeda  >ARG1
was*  
a  
joint  
enterprise  <ARG2
between  
the  
Egyptian  
extremists  
and  
the  
polyglot  
Arabs  >ARG1
around  
Bin  
Laden  
,  
only  
some  >R-ARG1
of  
whom  
were*  
Saudi  <ARG2
.  

Zarqawi  >ARG1
is*  
a  
Jordanian  <ARG2
,  
and  
his  
Monotheism  
and  
Holy  
War  
group  >>ARG1
in  
Afghanistan  
probably  >>ARGM-ADV
had*  
a  
distinctive  >ARGM-ADJ
coloration*  
as  
mainly  
Jordanian  <ARG2
,  
Palestinian  
and  
Syrian  
.  

They  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
had*  
a  
special  >ARGM-ADJ
connection*  
to  
some  
extremists  <ARG2
in  
Jordan  
and  
Germany  
.  

They  >>ARG1
are*  
probably  >ARGM-ADV
especially  >ARGM-EXT
oriented*  
toward  
the  
Salafi  
school  >>ARG0
of  
modern  >ARGM-ADJ
Islamic  >ARG0
thought*  
,  
which  >R-ARG0
has*  
a  
Protestant  
-  
like  >ARGM-ADJ
emphasis*  
on  
going*  
back  
to  
the  
original  
practice  <ARG2
of  
the  
early  
companions  
of  
the  
Prophet  
Muhammad  
.  

(  
Most  
Salafis  >>ARG1
are*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
militant  <ARG2
or  
violent*  
,  
though  
they  >>ARG1
tend*  
to  
be*  
rather  
narrow  
-  
minded  <ARG2
in  
my  >ARG0
experience*  
,  
on  
the  
order  <<ARGM-ADV
of  
Protestant  
Pietists  
)  
.  

Monotheism  >>ARG0
and  
Holy  
War  
obviously  >>ARGM-ADV
does*  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
violent  >ARGM-ADJ
interpretation*  
of  
Salafism  <ARG1
,  
rather  
as  
the  
the  
leaders  
of  
the  
so  
-  
called  
German  
Peasant  
Rebellion  
among  
early  
Protestants  
did*  
.  

Another  
worrisome  >ARGM-ADJ
sign*  >ARG1
is*  
that  
local  
Iraqi  
Sunni  
fundamentalists  >>ARG0
opposed*  
to  
the  
US  
presence  <ARG1
in  
Iraq  
have*  
begun*  
joining*  
Monotheism  <ARG1
and  
Holy  
War  
,  
and  
wearing*  
its  
distinctive  
orange  
and  
black  
insignia  <ARG1
.  

These  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
sighted*  
among  
Iraqi  
crowds  <ARGM-LOC
on  
Haifa  
Street  
in  
Baghdad  
and  
in  
Samarra  
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
now  >ARGM-TMP
there  
are*  
hundreds  <ARG1
of  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
members  
in  
Iraq  >>ARGM-LOC
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
there  
had*  
been*  
none  <ARG1
before  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
consolidation*  >>ARG1
of  
smaller  
local  
radical  
fundamentalist  
groups  <ARG1
with  
al  
-  
Qaeda  <ARG2
can  >>ARGM-MOD
also  >>ARGM-DIS
be*  
seen*  
in  
the  
case*  
of  
the  
Fizazi  
group  <ARG1
in  
Tangiers  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
morphed*  
into  
the  
Moroccan  
Islamic  
Combatant  
Group  >ARG0
,  
had*  
members  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
met*  
with  
September  
11  
ringleader  <ARG1
Muhammad  
Atta  
,  
and  
ultimately  >>ARGM-ADV
was*  
in  
part  >ARGM-EXT
responsible*  
for  
the  
Madrid  >ARGM-LOC
train  >ARG1
bombings*  
.  

The  
September  
11  
Panel  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
issue*  
its  >ARG0
findings*  
on  
Thursday  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG0
notes*  
10  
points  >>ARGM-ADJ
at  
which  >>R-ARGM-ADJ
the  
US  >>ARG0
made*  >ARGM-LVB
key  >ARGM-ADJ
mistakes*  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
stopped*  
Bin  >ARG0
Laden  
's  
plot*  
.  

Four  >ARG1
of  
these  
were*  
under  
Clinton  <ARG2
and  
6  
under  
Bush  
.  

Bush  >>ARG0
came*  
out  
today  <ARGM-TMP
and  
said*  
that  
if  
he  >>ARG0
had*  
known*  >>ARGM-ADV
what  >>ARG1
was*  
coming*  
,  
he  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
expended*  
every  
effort*  
to  
stop*  
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
that  
so  
would  
have*  
Clinton  
.  

This  
statement*  >ARG1
is*  
,  
despite  
its  
facade  <ARGM-ADV
of  
fair  
-  
mindedness  
,  
so  
many  
weasel  
words  <ARG2
.  

Of  >>ARGM-ADV
course  
Bush  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
tried*  
to  
stop*  
9/11  <ARG1
if  
he  >>ARG0
had*  
known*  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
coming*  
.  

The  
question*  >ARG1
is*  
,  
"  
Should  >>ARGM-MOD
he  >>ARG0
have*  
known*  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
coming*  
?  
"  

The  
answer*  >ARG1
is*  
,  
"  
Yes  <ARG2
!  
"  

We  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
know*  
that  
Bush  >>ARG0
and  
his  >ARG0
administration*  
came*  
into  
office  <ARG2
obsessed*  
with  
Iraq  <ARG1
.  

Cheney  >>ARG0
was*  
looking*  
at  
maps  <ARG1
of  
Iraq  
oil  
fields  
and  
muttering*  
about  
opportunities  <ARG1
for  
US  
companies  
there  
,  
already  <ARGM-TMP
in  
January  <ARGM-TMP
or  
February  
of  
2001  
.  

Wolfowitz  >>ARG0
contradicted*  
counter-terrorism  
czar  
Richard  <ARG1
Clarke  
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
latter  >ARG0
spoke*  
of  
the  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
threat  <ARG1
,  
insisting*  
that  
the  
preeminent  
threat  >ARG1
of  
terrorism  
against  
the  
US  
came*  
from  
Iraq  <ARG3
,  
and  
indicating*  
he  >ARG0
accepted*  
Laurie  
Mylroie  
's  
crackpot  
conspiracy  
theory  <ARG1
that  
Saddam  >ARG1
was*  
behind  
the  
1993  >ARGM-TMP
World  
Trade  
Towers  >ARG1
bombing*  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
believe*  >>ARGM-ADV
crackpot  
theories  <ARG1
instead  
of  
focusing*  
on  
the  
reality  <ARG2
--  
that  >ARG1
was*  
an  
al  
-  
Qaeda  >ARG0
operation*  >ARG1
mainly  >ARGM-ADV
carried*  
out  
by  
al  <ARG0
-  
Gamaa  
al  
-  
Islamiyyah  
,  
an  
Egyptian  
terrorist  
component  >ARG1
allied*  
with  
Bin  <ARG2
Laden  
--  
then  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
concentrate*  
on  
the  
wrong  
threat  <ARG1
.  

Even  
after  
the  
attacks*  >>ARGM-TMP
on  
September  <ARGM-TMP
11  
,  
Bush  >>ARG0
was*  
obsessing*  
about  
Iraq  <ARG1
.  

Wolfowitz  >>ARG0
lied*  
to  
him  <ARG2
and  
said*  
that  
there  
was*  
a  
10  
to  
50  
%  >ARGM-EXT
chance*  
that  
Iraq  >ARG1
was*  
behind  
them  <ARG2
.  

(  
On  
what  
evidence  
?  

The  
hijackers  >ARG1
were*  
obviously  <ARGM-ADV

no

an

on

in  
the  
summer  <ARGM-TMP
of  
2001  
when  >ARGM-TMP
George  
Tenet  
's  
hair  >ARG1
was*  
"  
on  
fire*  
"  
about  
the  
excited  
chatter  >>ARG1
the  
CIA  >>ARG0
was*  
picking*  
up  
from  
radical  
Islamist  
terrorists  <ARGM-DIR
.  

As  
for  
the  
Clinton  >>ARGM-ADV
administration*  
,  
let*  
me  >ARG0
say*  
one  
thing  <ARG1
in  
its  >ARG1
defense*  
.  

Clinton  >>ARG0
had*  
worked*  
out  
a  
deal*  >>ARG0
with  
Pakistani  
Prime  
Minister  <ARG1
Nawaz  
Sharif  
in  
summer  <<ARGM-TMP
of  
1999  
that  >>R-ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
allowed*  
the  
US  >ARG0
to  
send*  
a  
Special  
Ops  
team  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
after  
Bin  <ARG2
Laden  
in  
Qandahar  <ARGM-LOC
,  
based*  
from  
Pakistan  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
presume*  
you  >ARG0
need*  
the  
Pakistan  
base  <ARG1
for  
rescue  >ARG3
operations*  
in  
case  
anything  >>ARG1
went*  
wrong*  
.  

You  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
need*  
Pakistani  
air  
space  <ARG1
.  

The  
plan*  >>ARG1
was*  
all  >ARGM-EXT
set*  
and  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
succeeded*  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
in  
fall  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
1999  
,  
Gen.  >>ARG0
Pervez  
Musharraf  
made*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
coup*  
against  
Nawaz  <ARG1
Sharif  
.  

The  
Pakistani  
army  >>ARG1
was*  
rife*  
with  
elements  <ARG2
protective  
of  
the  
Taliban  
,  
and  
the  
new  
military  
government  >ARG0
reneged*  
on  
the  
deal*  
.  

Musharraf  >ARG0
told*  
Clinton  <ARG2
he  >>ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
use*  
Pakistani  
soil  <ARG1
or  
air  
space  
to  
send*  
the  
team  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
against  
Bin  <ARG2
Laden  
.  

Look*  
at  
a  
map  <ARG1
and  
you  >>ARG0
try*  
to  
figure*  
out  
how  >ARGM-MNR
,  
in  
fall  >ARGM-TMP
of  
1999  
,  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
possibly  >ARGM-ADV
pull*  
off  
such  
an  
operation*  
without  
Pakistani  
facilities  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

Of  >ARGM-ADV
course  
,  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
go*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
by  
main  
force  <ARGM-MNR
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
for  
those  >>ARGM-PRP
of  
you  
tempted*  
in  
that  
direction  <ARG3
,  
please  >ARGM-DIS
look*  
up  
Carter  >ARG0
's  
Tabas  >ARGM-LOC
operation*  
.  

It  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
easily  >ARGM-ADV
googled*  
.  

Clinton  >>ARG0
tried*  
,  
and  
tried*  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
.  

The  
gods  >ARG1
were*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
with  
us  <ARG2
on  
that  
one  <ARGM-ADV
.  

that  >ARG1
is*  
how  >>ARG2
i  >ARG0
want*  
you  >ARG0
to  
refer*  
to  
me  <ARG1
as  
"  
the  
king  <<C-ARG1
"  

i  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
so  <ARG1
.  

i  >ARG1
'm*  
the

yeah  

sounds*  
exciting*

you  >ARG0

later  <<ARGM-TMP

you  >ARG0
doing*  
tonight  <ARGM-TMP
.  

like  
what

of  
a  
few  
things  <ARG1

you  >ARG1
r*  
retarded  <ARG2
.  

i  >>ARG0
used*

they  >ARG1

great  
dogs  <ARG2
.  

cocker  
spaniels  >ARG1

why  >>ARGM-CAU
do*  
you  >ARG0
think*  
i  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
one  <ARG1
of  
those  
?  

ca  >ARGM-MOD

want*  
to  
see*

to  
make*  
a  
cd  <ARG1
.  

i  >ARG1
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG

like  
tony

like

an  
entree  
.  

yeah  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
i  >>ARG0
was*  
thinking*  
somewhere  <ARG1
like  
mcdonald  
's  
.  

that  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
too  >ARGM-EXT
nice*  
though  <ARGM-ADV

John  
,  

Hello  
from  
South  
America  
.  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
got*  
your  >ARG0
email*  
and  
I  >ARG0
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
concur*  
with  
Jeff  >>ARG0
making*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
call*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
has*  
maintained*  
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
relationship*  
with  
Mulva  <ARG2
.  

This  >ARG1
was*  
a  
risk*  >ARGM-PRR
that  
we  <ARG0
had*  
but  
we  >>ARG1
did*  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
assurances*  
from  
Phillips  <ARG0
regarding  
performance*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
how  
much  >ARGM-EXT
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
help*  
however  <<ARGM-DIS
.  

Richard  >ARG0
Harper  
and  
Mary  
Nell  
Browning  
may  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
some  
ideas  <ARG1
here  <ARGM-ADV
but  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
sure*  
you  >>ARG0
've*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
gone*  
through  
it  <ARG1
with  
them  <ARGM-COM
.  

I  >>ARG1
am*  
amazed*  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
the  
details  >>ARG1
get*  
fuzzy*  
on  
an  
old  
project  <ARGM-PRD
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
discussed*  >>ARGM-TMP
it  <ARG1
,  
i  >>ARG0
was*  
trying*  
to  
think*  
back  <ARG1
to  
our  >ARG0
remedies  
and  
discussions*  
but  
the  
3  
years  >>ARG0
have*  
made*  
it  >ARG1
difficult*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
if  
there  
is*  
anything  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
but  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
willing*  
to  
help*  
.  

Good  
luck  
,  

Mike  

These  
guys  >ARG0

Well  >ARGM-DIS

I  >ARG0

this  >ARG1

actually  <ARGM-ADV
a  
good  
thing  <ARG2
--  
makes*  
our  >ARG0

a

Hi

Well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
you  >ARG0
know*  
it  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
not  >ARGM-NEG

,  
but  
I  >ARG0
bet*  
that  
we  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
hitch*  
a  
ride*  
back  <<ARGM-DIR
with  
Anil  <<ARGM-COM

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure*  
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
think*  
that  
he  >>ARG0
's*  >ARG0
got*  
class  <ARG1
tonite  <ARGM-TMP
,  
too  <ARGM-DIS
.  

I  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
search*  
him  <ARG2
out  <ARGM-PRD
before  
class  <ARGM-TMP
or  
after  
that  
break*  
and  
see*  
if  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
set*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

daily  
dose  
on  
enron  
-  

we  >>ARG1
are*  
finished*  
.  

i  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
now  >ARGM-TMP
get*  
a  
job  <ARG1
at  
house  
of  
pies  
b/c  
that  >ARG1
is*  
the  
only  
way  >ARGM-MNR
to  
pay*  
the  
bills  <ARG2
.  

the  
economy  >ARG1
is*  
down  <ARG2
and  
when  >ARGM-TMP

collapses*  
,  
the  
energy  
industry  >>ARG1
is*  
going*  
to  
be*  
in  
a  
world  <ARG2

not  
to  
mention  
the

going*  
to  
be*  
flooded*  
with  
enron  
folks  <ARG2
.  

ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
to  
any  
more  
lsu  
games  <ARG4
unless  
i  >ARG0
get*  
a  
free  
ticket  <ARG1
.  

Since  
work*  >>ARG1
has*  
gone*  >>ARGM-CAU
to  
hell  <ARG4
,  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
hoping*  
to  
find*  
some  
excitement*  
in  
the  
possibility  <<ARGM-LOC
that  
LSU  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
play*  
in

Cotton

if

up  
for  
the  
next

games  <ARGM-PRP

)  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
purchase*  
tickets  <ARG1
until  
it  >ARG1
is*  
a

Vince

We  >>ARG0
are*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
trying*  
to  
work*  
the  
PSE  
swap  >ARG1
transaction*  
,  
now  <<ARGM-ADV
that  
the  
forex  
desk  >>ARG0
has*  
been*  
able*  
to  
find*  
a  
fix*  
for  
CPI  <ARG1
in  
the  
market  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

Further  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
my  
voicemail  
,  
our  
colleagues  >>ARG0
in  
credit*  
are*  
calculating*  
the  
reserve  <ARG1
on  
the  
PSE  
swap  
.  

They  >>ARG0
are*  
currently  >ARGM-TMP
using*  
9.5  
%  >ARG1
fixed*  
based  
on  
the  
1  
year  
implied*  
volatility  <ARG1
.  

Volatility  >>ARG1
of  
USD  
/  
DM  
has*  
been*  
in  
the  
range  <ARG2
of  
between  
7  
%  
and  
11  
%  
.  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
one  >ARG0
of  
your  
research  
staff  
justify*  
a  
suitable  
20  
year  
volalatility  
number  <ARG1
for  
USD  
/  
Euro  
.  

Ideally  >ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
a  
fast  
turnaround  <ARG1
.  

In  
addition*  >ARGM-DIS
,  
is*  
there  
someone  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
consider*  
the  
correlation*  
between  
US  
CPI  <ARG1
and  
the  
$  
/  
euro  
exchange  
rate  
.  

The  
credit  
guys  >>ARG0
are*  
currently  >ARGM-TMP
assuming*  
that  
there  
is*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
correlation*  
and  
may  >>ARGM-MOD
consequently  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
double  >ARGM-ADV
dipping*  
the  
credit  
reserve  <ARG1
on  
this  
basis  <ARGM-MNR
too  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Grateful  
for  
any  
help*  >>ARG1
or  
suggestions*  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
provide*  
.

one

to  
get*  
a  
general  
feel  <ARG1
of  
your  
end  
of  
the

.  

Pat  >>ARG0
had*  
told*  
me  <ARG2
before  
he  >ARG0
left*  
that  
it  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
help*  
me  >ARG0
better  >ARGM-EXT
grasp*  
the  
process*  
as  
a  
whole  <<ARGM-MNR

I  >ARG0
understand*  
the  
imminent  
cold  
weather  >>ARG0
is*  
making*  
things  >ARG1
crazy*

so  >ARGM-ADV
now  >ARG2
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
the  
best  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
be*  
in  
your  >ARG1
way*  
.  

But  
let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
if  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
spend*  
a  
day  <ARG1
,

even  
just  
an

down  
there  <ARGM-LOC
with  
you  <ARGM-COM
whenever  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
is*  
a

I  >ARG0

it  >ARG0

The  
Dow  >ARG1
topped*  
out  
in  
February  <ARGM-TMP
of  
1966  
at  
995  <ARG2
.  

By  
September  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
that  
year  
the  
Dow  >>ARG1
had*  
tumbled*  
to  
744  <ARG4
.  

The  
Dow  >ARG1
then  >ARGM-TMP
rallied*  
to  
a  
high  <ARG4
of  
943  
in  
September  <ARGM-TMP
of  
'67  
.  

By  
March  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
'68  
the  
Dow  >>ARG1
had*  
fallen*  
to  
825  <ARG4
,  
only  >ARGM-ADV
to  
climb*  
to  
a  
highly  
speculative  
peak  <ARG4
of  
985  
in  
December  <ARGM-TMP
of  
'68  
.  

The  
Dow  >ARG1
then  >ARGM-TMP
sank*  
to  
631  <ARG4
in  
December  <ARGM-TMP
of  
'70  
.  

By  
April  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
'71  
the  
Dow  >>ARG1
had*  
climbed*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
to  
950  <ARG4
,  
only  >ARGM-ADV
to  
fall*  
to  
869  <ARG4
in  
February  <ARGM-TMP
of  
'72  
.  

A  
big  >ARGM-ADJ
rally*  >>ARG0
then  >ARGM-TMP
took*  
the  
Dow  <ARG1
(  
unconfirmed  
)  
to  
a  
record  
high  <ARG3
of  
1051  
in  
January  <ARGM-TMP
of  
'73  
,  
turning*  
everyone  <ARG1
bullish  <ARG2
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
by  
December  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
'73  
the  
Dow  >>ARG1
had*  
collapsed*  
to  
788  <ARG4
.  

Think*  
that  >>ARG1
was*  
bad*  
-  
by  
December  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
'74  
the  
Dow  >>ARG1
had*  
sunk*  
to  
a  
bear  
market  
low  <ARG4
of  
577  
.  

At  
that  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
gurus  >>ARG0
and  
geniuses  
of  
Wall  
Street  
were*  
predicting*  
a  
250  
Dow  <ARG1
and  
many  >>ARG0
were*  
talking*  
openly  <ARGM-MNR
about  
the  
end*  
of  
capitalism  <ARG1
.  

Of  >ARGM-DIS
course  
,  
that  >ARG1
was*  
the  
bottom  <ARG2

And  
that  >ARG1
's*  
the  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
the  
greatest  
bear  
market  >ARG0
since  
the  
Depression  
worked*  
its  >ARG0
way*  
down  <<ARGM-DIR
.  

By  
late  
1974  >>ARGM-TMP
investors  >>ARG1
were*  
dizzy*  
,  
they  >>ARG0
were*  
desperate*  
,  
they  >>ARG1

,  
they  >>ARG0

drafts  <<ARG1
of  
the  
Enron  >ARG0

to  
be*  
made*  
in  
support*  
of  
EPMI  >ARG1

under  
the  
Indian  
Mesa

Renewable  
Energy  
Purchase  
Agreement  <<ARGM-ADV
(

)  
and  
Green  
Premium  
Sharing  
Agreement  
(  
"  
GSPA  
"  
)  
.?  

The  
guaranty  >>ARG1
for  
the  
PPA  
is*  
blacklined*  
against  
the  
Enron  
EPC  
Contract  
guaranty  <ARG2
in  
favor  <ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
banks  
which  >>ARG1
was*  
granted*  
in  
connection*  
with  
our  
Cabazon  
Wind  
Power  
Project  <ARG2
(  
the  
project  >ARG1
most  
recently  >ARGM-TMP
financed*  
by  
EWC  <ARG0

and  
the

guaranty  >>ARG1
is*  
blacklined*  
against  
the  
PPA

As  
we  >ARG0
discussed*  >>ARGM-ADV
last  
week  <ARGM-TMP
,  
since  
the  
Enron  
guaranties  >>ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
need*  >>ARGM-CAU
to  
be*  
in  
a  
form  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
acceptable*  
to  
our  
project  
lenders  <ARG0
and  
equity  
participants  
,  
we  >ARG0
thought*  
that  
we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
start*  
with  
a  
form  >>ARG2
that  >>R-ARG1
was*  
used*  
in  
our  >ARG0
last  >ARGM-TMP
financing*  
and  
that  >>R-ARG2
was*  
negotiated*  
by  
Enron  <ARG0
and  
the  
banks  
.  

We  >>ARG0
plan*  
to  
use*  
the  
same  
basic  
form  <ARG1
for  
the  
Enron  >ARG0
guaranty*  >>ARGM-PRR
that  
will  <ARGM-MOD
be*  
made*  
in

with  
respect*  
to  
the

under

I  >>ARG0

Perhaps  >ARGM-ADV

we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
start*  
with  
just  
a  
1  
or  
2  
day  
contract  >>ARGM-ADV
where  >>R-ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
give*  
some

to  
the

that  >R-ARG1

Your  >ARG0
suggestion*  >>ARG1

introduce*  
the  
concept  >ARG1
discussed*  
with  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
Lays  
is*  
welcomed*  
.  

I  >ARG0
hope*  
that  
this  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
mean*  
that  
you  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
remain*  
involved*  
at  
some  
level  <ARGM-ADV
.  

The  
design*  >>ARG1
of  
the  
model  <ARG1
and  
its  
potential  
economics  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
key*  
to  
how  
worthy  >>ARG2
the  
effort*  >ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
.  

Enron  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
an  
ideal  
environment  >>ARGM-DIR
from  
which  >>R-ARGM-DIR
to  
the  
concept  
enhancement  >>ARG1
through  
to  
commercialization*  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
successfully  >ARGM-MNR
accomplished*  
.  

Please  >>ARGM-DIS
confidentially  >>ARGM-MNR
share*  
matters  <ARG1
as  
you  >ARG0
think*  
best*  
and  
advise*  
me  <ARG1

Vince  

I  >ARG0
thought*  
that  
since  
Chonawee  >ARG0

an  
optimization  
background  <ARG1
,  
he  
would  >>ARGM-MOD

this  >>ARG1

fine*  
?

We  >>ARG0

Once  
we  >ARG0

Are*

Hello  
there  

Action  
Network  >ARG1
is*  
a  
BBC  
website  <ARG2
for  
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
are*  
taking*  >ARGM-LVB
action*  
on  
issues*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
concern*  
them  <ARG0
.  

I  >>ARG1
'm*  
getting*  
in  
touch*  
because  
I  >ARG0
think*  
it  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
useful*  
to  
people  >ARG0
campaigning*  
about  
hospital  
closures  <ARG1
.  

We  >>ARG0
've*  
got*  
a  
page  >ARG1

to  
issues*  
around  
hospitals  <ARGM-ADJ
(

and  
a  
group  >>ARG0
called*  
NHS

have*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
put*  
up  
a  
campaign*  
about  
ward  
closures  <ARG1

Cumbria  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
hoping*  
to  
build*  
this  >ARG1
up  <C-V
to  
be*  
a  
hub  <ARG2

all

can  >ARGM-MOD
exchange*  
ideas  <ARG1

advice

It  
would  >>ARGM-MOD

great*  
if  
the

up  <ARGM-DIR
a  
short  >ARGM-ADJ
description*  
of  
the  
campaign*  
and  
a  
list  
to  
this  
group  
page  
on  
the  
Action  
Network  
site  <<ARG2

Action  
Network  >ARG1

also  <ARGM-DIS
a  
good  
place  >>ARGM-LOC
to  
post*  
details  <ARG1

events  
,  
or  
try*  
to  
rally*  
together  <ARGM-PRD

group  <ARG1
if  
you  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
action*  
in  
your  
area  <ARGM-LOC

You  >ARG0

anything  >ARG1

U.S.

launch*  >>ARG1
to  
the

on  
sleek  
,

shuttle

this  
country  >>ARG0

developed*  
in  
more  
than  
a  
decade  <ARGM-TMP
,  
NASA  >>ARG0
and  
the  
Pentagon  
have*  
told*  
the  
White

.  

Lunar  
landers  >>ARG1
and  
other  
gear  >ARG1
needed*  
for  
extended  >ARGM-ADJ
visits*  
to  
the

be*  
lofted*  
by  
gargantuan  
launchers  <ARG0
as  
big  
as  
the  
Apollo

era  
Saturn  
5  
,  
the  
most  
powerful  
rockets  >ARG1
ever  >ARGM-TMP
flown*  
.  

It  >ARG0
looks*  
as  
if  
NASA  >>ARG1
is*  
transitioning*  
away  <ARGM-DIR
from  
the  
shuttle  
model  <ARG3
,  
as  
in  
the  
past  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
have*  
proven*  
to  
be*  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
dangerous*  
as  
Columbia  >>ARG0
has*  
recently  >ARGM-TMP
proved*  
.  

Although  
these  
new  
rockets  >>ARG1
are*  
probably  >ARGM-ADV
more  >ARGM-EXT
expensive*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
go*  
at  
a  
much  
greater  
range  <ARG2
than  
it's  
shuttle  
cousins

as  
they  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  
only  
break*  
free*  
from  
the  
atmosphere  <<ARG1

reach*  
the

as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

"

launch  
vehicle  >ARG1
derived*

the  
space  
shuttle

solid

for  
future  >ARGM-TMP
missions*  
to

"  
the

NASA  >>ARG0
is*  
planning*  
on  
using*  
these  
new  
shuttles  <ARG1
to  
replace*  
the  
current  >ARGM-TMP

,  
with  
industry  
forecasters  >ARG0
predicting*  
a  
launch*  
as  
early  <ARGM-TMP
as  
2014  
.  

The  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
rocket  >ARG1
design*  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
differ*  
slightly  <ARGM-EXT
from  
it's  
predecessors  <ARG2
,  
in  
the  
fact  <ARG3
that  
the  
crew  >>ARG0

cargo  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
launch*  
separately  <ARGM-MNR
from  
two  
different  
rockets  <ARGM-DIR
each  <ARGM-ADV
and  
join*  
up  
in  
space  <ARGM-LOC
later  
on  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Launching*  >>ARG0
this  
way*  
will  >ARGM-MOD
hopefully  >ARGM-ADV
avoid*  
future  
disasters  <ARG1
,  
giving*  >ARGM-LVB
more  >ARGM-EXT
support*  
towards  
NASA  >ARG0
revisiting*  
the

try*  
yelp.com  <ARG1

how  
many  
ounces

a

in  
ireland  
?  

Depends*  
of  
what  <ARG1

Ounces  >ARG0
measure*  
weight  <ARG1
,  
pints  >ARG2
measure*  
volume  <ARG1

If

mean*  
fluid  
ounces  <ARG2
,  
20  
,  
as  
opposed  
to  
the  
16  
in  
America

An  
Irish

20  
fluid  
ounces  
in  
a  
Pint  
in  
Ireland  

as  
R  
-  
G  >ARG0
said*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
there  
are*  
only  
16  <ARG1
in  
an  
American  
one  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Know*  
this  <ARG1
well  <ARGM-MNR
because  
I  >ARG0
remember*  
an  
'  
irish  
'  
pub  >>ARG0
in  
the  
town  >ARGM-LOC
in  
canada  
i  >ARG1
grew*  
up  
in  <C-ARGM-LOC
used*  
to  
advertise*  
the  
cheapest  
pints  <ARG1
of  
guinness  
in  
town  
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
served*  
them  <ARG1
in  
american  
sized  
pints  <ARGM-MNR
.  

That  
place  >>ARG1
did*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
stay*  
open*  
too  
long  <ARGM-TMP
:D  

need*  
help*  
finding*  
irish  
music  <ARG1
?  

i  >>ARG0
love*  
The  
Script  <ARG1
and  
know*  
the  >ARG1
re*  
from  
iraland  <ARG2
.  

i  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
more  
bands  <ARG1
like  
them  
pleasseee  <ARGM-DIS

The  
thing  >ARG1
about  
The  
Script  
is*  
they  >>ARG1
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
sound*  
that  
Irish  <ARG2
,  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
surprised*  
to  
hear*  
they  >ARG1
were*  
from  
Dublin  <ARG2
.  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
if  
you  >>ARG1
are*  
interested*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
suggest*  
you  >>ARG0
have*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
look*  
at  
General  
Fiasco  <ARG1
,  
Two  
Door  
Cinema  
Club

Wallis  
Bird  
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
you  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
pleased*  
.  

I  >ARG0
doubt*  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
a  
sensible  >ARGM-MNR
answer*  
in  
the  
"  
TRAVEL

section  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

*  
Ireland  

And  >ARGM-DIS
there  
's*  
nothing  <ARG1
distinctly  
Irish  
about  
them  
.  

You  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
find*  
similar  
bands  >ARG1
to  
them  
that  >R-ARG1
are*  
from  
the  
UK  <ARG2
and  
US  
.

I  >ARG0

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
going*  
on  
a

and  
I  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
find*  
a  
good

I  >>ARG0
've*

looked*  
,  
but  
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
find*  
one  <ARG1

!  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
prefer*  
a  
simple  
,  
fitted  
black  
one  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
actually  >ARGM-ADV
needs*  
to  
be*  
relatively  
waterproof  <ARG2
-  
the  
last  
one  >>ARG0
I  >ARG0
bought*  
had*  
me  
soaked  <ARG1
in  
anything  <ARGM-LOC
more  
than  
light

moderate  
rain  
.  

I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
pay*  
up  
to  
200  <ARG1

250  
for  
it  <ARG3
if

donatello  >ARG1
is*  
of  
a  
boy  
david  <ARG2
as  
a  
young  
sheep  
Herder  
,  
the  
Michelangelo  >ARG1
is*  
the  
grown  
up  
man  
david  <ARG2
as  
slayer  
and  
king  

Because  
he  >>ARG0
liked*  
making*  
statues  <ARG1
of  
David  
!  
:D  

Obviously  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
arrested*  
and  
jailed*  
-  
imagine*  
making*  
a  
statue  <ARG1
or  
painting  
on  
the  
same  
subject  
as  
another  
artist  
-  
clearly  
insulting  
and  
disrespecting  
-  
wasted  
time  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
used*  
making*  
a  
statue  <ARG1
with

Name  
of  
specific  
Hibachi  
restaurant  
in  
Chicago  
?  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
friend  <ARG1
out  
in  
Chicago  
this  
week  
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
trying*  
to  
remember*  
the  
name  <ARG1
of  
an  
awesome  
hibachi  
style  
restaurant  >ARG1
i  >ARG0
visited*  
while  
out  
there  <ARGM-TMP
a  
couple  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
in  
the  
Lincoln  
Square  
area  <ARG2
but  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
quote*  
me  <ARG2
on  
that  <ARG3
.  

It's  
'  
gimmick  >ARG1
'  
was*  
that  
you  >>ARG0
fill*  
your  
bowl  <ARG1
cafeteria  
-  
style  <ARGM-MNR
from  
raw  
ingredients  <ARG2
and  
leave*  
it  <ARG1
on  
the  
counter  <ARG2
with  
a  
chopstick  >ARG0
listing*  
your  
table  
number  <ARG1
on  
it  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Four  
guys  >ARG0
around  
a  
large  
square  
open  
hibachi  
cook*  
your  
food  <ARG1
,  
and  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
's*  
finished*  >ARGM-TMP
a  
server  >ARG0
brings*  
it  <ARG1
to  
your  
table  <ARG2
.  

All  
-  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
-  
eat*  
style  >ARG2
deal*  
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
pretty  
epic  <ARG2
as  
I  >ARG0
remember*  
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
love*  
to  
send*  
my  
friend  <ARG1
there  <ARG2
.  

Any  
help*  
?  

That  >ARG1
is*  
Flat

What  >ARG2
's*  
the  
best  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
start*  
a  
trip*  
around  
the  
world  <ARG1
?  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
about  <ARG2
to  
graduate*  
in  
less  
then  
a  
year  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
planning*  
to  
study*  
medical  
school  <ARG1
.  

But  
since  
in  
my  
country  >ARGM-LOC
it  >ARG1
lasts*  
for  
minimum  <ARGM-ADV
6  
years  <ARG2
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
go*  
aground  
the  
world  <ARG1
,  
what  >>ARG1
do*  
you  >ARG0
think*  
,  
should  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
do*  
it  <ARG1
before  
or  
after  
medical  
school  <ARGM-TMP
?  

If  
you  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
afford*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
go*  
before  <ARGM-TMP
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
by  
all  
means  >ARGM-ADV
,  
GO*  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG1
have*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
wait*  
,  
due  
to  
financial  
reasons  <ARGM-CAU
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
wait*  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
much  
rather  >ARGM-ADV
put*  
it  <ARG1
off  <C-V
until  
I  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
afford*  
to  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
vacation*  
of  
a  
lifetime  <ARGM-ADJ
as  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
sure*  
this  
trip*  >>ARG1
is*  
intended*  
to  
be*  
.  

Airfare  >>ARG1
alone  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
incredibly  >ARGM-EXT
expensive*  
so  >ARGM-ADV
make*  
sure*  
you  >>ARG0
have*  
the  
money  >>ARGM-ADV
and  
of  
course  
free  
time  
to  
take*  
your  
time  <ARG1
and  
have*  
a  
great  
time  <ARG1
.  

canon  
t2i  >>ARG1
stops*  
working*  
?  

My  
canon  
t2i  >>ARG1
stops*  
working*  
at  
times  <ARGM-TMP
as  
in  
the  
power  
bottom  >>ARG1
is*  
switched*  
to  
"  
on  <ARG2
"  
but  
the  
camera  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
respond*  
to  
any  
function*  
.  

the  
camera  >>ARG1
only  >ARGM-ADV
begins*  
to  
work*  
again  <ARGM-TMP
when  >>ARGM-TMP
i  >>ARG0
take*  
out  
the  
battery  <ARG1
and  
put*  
it  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
in  <ARG2
.  

did*  
anyone  >>ARG1
have*  >ARGM-LVB
this  
issue*  
?  

is*  
it  <ARG1
worthy*  
to  
send*  
in  <ARG2
for  
warranty  >ARGM-ADJ
repair*  
?  

thanks*  
!  

Sounds*  
simple*  >ARG2
enough*  
to  
me  <ARGM-GOL
.  

Your  
camera  >>ARG0
is*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
acting*  
normally  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
got*  
warranty  <ARG1
,  
let*  
Canon  >ARG0
deal*  
with  
it  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
agree*  
.  

I  >>ARG1
shoot*  
a  
t1i  <ARG1
and  
have*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
had*  >ARGM-LVB
such  
an  
issue*  
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
agree*  
it  >ARG1
's*  
under  
warranty  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
get*  
in  
touch*  
with  
Canon  <<ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
sounds*  
like  
a  
firmware  >ARG0
issue*  
and  
the  
camera  >ARG0
requires*  
a  
re-boot  <ARG1
just  
like  
what  >ARG1
happens*  
in  
a  
computer  <ARG2
-  
needs*  
a  
re-start  <ARG1
from  
time  <ARGM-TMP
to  
time  
but  
it  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
happening*  
in  
a  
camera  <ARG2
.

I  >ARG1

with  
those  
deal*  
-  
a

day

Any

I  >ARG0
usually  >ARGM-TMP

basically  >ARGM-ADV

Living  
Social  
,  
and

pretty  
much  >ARGM-ADV
get*  
whatever  >ARGM-ADJ
deal*  >ARG1
you  >ARG0

Most  >>ARG0
of  
the

let*  
you  >ARG0

500  
ff  <ARGM-ADV
,  
and  
some  >>ARG1
of  
the

are*  
even  >ARGM-ADV
free*  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0

without  
worrying*  
about  
all  
those  
daily

Where  >ARGM-LOC
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
go*

?  

Looking*  
for  
something  <ARG1
on  
the

side  
and  
we  >ARG0
want*  
it  >>ARG1

be*  
fun*  
.  

May  >ARGM-MOD
seem*  
a  
little  
silly  <ARG1
,  
but  
,  
taking*  >>ARG1
a  
long  >ARGM-TMP
ride*  
on  
the  
Metra  
system  <ARG1
or  
the  
"  
L  
"  
system  
is*  
a  
great  >ARGM-MNR
way*  >ARGM-MNR
to  
see*  
the  
city  <ARG1
and  
sites  
without  
spending*  
a  
fortune  <ARG3
.  

Or  
how  
about  
visiting*  
the  
Chicago  
Botanical  
Gardens  <ARG1
and  
see*  
the  
change*  
of

if

I  >>ARG0
decided*  
to  
get*  
a  
150  
gal  
aquarium  <ARG1
,  
what  >ARG2
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
fill*  
it  <ARG1
with  <C-ARG2
?  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
thinking*  
cichlids  <ARG1
?  

Possibly  
a  
freshwater  
tank  
with  
a  
ton  
of  
different  
species  
in  
there  
.  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
kept*  
cichlids  <ARG1
though  <ARGM-DIS
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
saltwater  >ARG1
is*  
a  
possibility  <ARG2
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
give*  
me  <ARG2
a  
possible  
stocking  
option  <ARG1
for  
that  
too  
?  

I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
choose*  
the  
one  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
sounds*  
the  
best  <ARG2
after  
looking*  
into  
all  
the  
fish  <ARG1
:)  

Here  >ARG2
is*  
the  
stocking*  
for  
my  
150  
gallon  
tank  <ARG2
i  >ARG0
upgraded*  
it  <ARG1
to  
200  <ARG4
at  
the  
weekend  <ARGM-TMP
because  
of  
the  
clownloach  <ARGM-CAU

If

make*

fill*

I  >ARG0
think*  
the  
women  >ARG0

this

know*  
that  
their  
business  >>ARG1

The

.  

It  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
little  
on  
the  
spicy  
side  <ARG2
but  
just  >ARGM-ADV
ask*  
them  <ARG2
exactly  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
want*  
and  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
very  >ARGM-EXT

I  >>ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV

Unfortunately  >>ARGM-ADV

it  >ARG1
a  
couple  >ARGM-ADJ
of  
tries*  
at  
different  
times  <ARGM-TMP

The

n't  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-ADV

it  >ARG0
shows*

It  >>ARG1
was*  
late*  
in  
the  
day  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
worried*  
I  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
get*  
charged*  
an  
arm  <ARG1
and  
a  
leg  
and  
have*  
to  
wait*  
forever  <ARGM-TMP

They  >>ARG0
picked*  
my  
car  <ARG1
up  <C-V

Yarmouth  <ARGM-LOC
and  
towed*  
to  
Bath  <ARG2
for  
a

used*  
to  
take*  
my  
cars  <ARG1

all  
the  
time  <ARGM-TMP

but  
management*  >ARG1
changes*  
hands  <ARG2
too  
frequently  <ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
service*  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
slow*  
,  
and  
they  >>ARG0
often  >ARGM-TMP
try*  
to  
"  
add*  
on  
"  
extra  >ARGM-ADJ
services*  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
sometimes  >>ARGM-TMP
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
needed*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
there  <ARG4
anymore  <ARGM-TMP

did*  
everything  <ARG1
to  
sort*  
out  
my  
windscreen  <ARG1

It  >>ARG1
was*  
all  >ARGM-EXT
sorted*  
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
hassle*  
at  
all  <ARGM-ADV
and  
I  >>ARG0

I  >ARG0

this

The  
price*  >>ARG1

so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
said*  
hey  >ARGM-DIS
this  >>ARG1
seems*  
great*  
.  

After  
they  >ARG1
showed*  >ARGM-TMP
up  
there  
was*  
a  
little  
trouble  >ARGM-ADV
to  
get*  
my  
car  >ARG1
unlocked*  
,  
it  >ARG0
took*  
quite  
a

the  
job  >ARG1
was*  
well  
done  <ARG2

sprayed*  
our

He  >>ARG0
seemed*  
to

how  
important  >ARG2
it  
was*  
for  
us  >ARG0
to  
make*  
sure*  
the  
whole

My

the  
7th  <ARGM-TMP

the  
14th  <ARGM-TMP
of  
December

it  >ARG1
was*  
a  
great  >ARGM-MNR
stay*  
from

to  
end*  
.  

Okay  
our  
room  >ARG1
was*  
at  
times  <ARGM-TMP
noisy  <ARG2

we  >ARG1

in  
a

The

Michael  >>ARG0

shoot*  
the

my

website  
and  
we  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
have*  
been*  
happier*  
.  

We  >>ARG0
went*  
through  
six  
photographers  <ARG1
to  
find*  
the  
right  
photographers  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0

our  
firm  <ARG1
in  
the  
light  <ARG2
we  >ARG0
wished*  
to  <ARG1

Michael  >ARG0

his

made*  
that  >ARG1

He  >>ARG1

Average

I  >>ARG0
have*

several  
times  <ARGM-TMP
and  
every  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
service*  >>ARG1
is*  
slower*  
than  
slow  <ARGM-CXN
.  

One  
time  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
left*  
after  
sitting*  
at  
the  
table  <ARG2
for  
20  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
and  
not  >>ARGM-NEG
being*  
greeted*

Ridiculous

There  
must  >ARGM-MOD

better

I  >ARG1

I  >ARG0
went*  
however  >>ARGM-DIS

my  
beer  >>ARG1

warm*  
and  
the

so

so  <ARG2

I  >ARG0

that  
careless  
teenager  
kind  <ARG1
of  
treatment*  
from  
some  <<ARG2

their

...  
perhaps  >ARGM-ADV

hire*  
more  
serious

/  
cook*

very  
over

The

this  >>ARG2
just  >>ARGM-ADV
does*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG

up  
for  
the  
lack

We  >ARG0
tried*  
4  
different

all  <ARGM-ADV
the
