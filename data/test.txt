President  >ARG0

Bush  >ARG0

The  
sheikh  >>>ARG1

has  V01
been  V03
attacked  V01
with  
a  
F

launched  
bomb  <ARGM-MNR
.  

He  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
killed  V01
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
and  
the  
israelians  >ARG0
have  V03
all  
the  
reasons  <ARG1
,  
since  
he  >ARG0
founded  V01
and  
he  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
spiritual  
leader  <ARG2
of  
Hamas  <<ARG1
,  
but  
they  
did  V01
n't  
.  

Today  
's  
incident  >ARG0
proves  V01
that  
Sharon  >>ARG0
has  V01
lost  V02
his  
patience  <ARG1
and  
his  >ARG0
hope  V01
in  
peace  V01
.  

Nervous  
people  >>ARG0
make  VLV
mistakes  V02
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
suppose  V01
there  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V02
a  
wave  V04
of  
succesfull  >ARGM-MNR
arab  >ARG0
attacks  V01

In  
the  
eastern  
city  >ARGM-LOC

guerrillas  >>ARG0
detonated  V01
a  
car  
bomb  <ARG1

station  <ARGM-LOC
,  
killing  V01
several  
people  <ARG1

The

lost  V02

another  
helicopter  <ARG1
to  
hostile  >ARGM-ADJ
fire  V01
near  
Habbaniyah  <ARGM-LOC
in  
the  
Sunni  
heartland  
,  
but  
this  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
crew  >>ARG1
was  V01
safe  V01

In  
Fallujah  >ARGM-LOC
,  
hundreds  >ARG1

demonstrators  
came  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR

US  
troops  <ARGM-PRD
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
briefly  >ARGM-TMP
arrested  V01
a  
yound  
newlywed  
bride  <ARG1

(  
I  >ARG0
hope  V01
that  
the  
US  
army  >ARG0
got  V01
an  
enormous  
amount  <ARG1
of  
information  
from  
her  
relatives  <ARG2
,  
because  
otherwise  >>ARGM-ADV
this  
move  V01
was  V01
a  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
,  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
tradeoff  V03

.  

The  
US  
troops  >>ARG0
fired  V01
into  
the  
hostile  
crowd  <ARGM-GOL
,  
killing  V01
4  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
seems  V01
clear  V06
to  
me  <<ARG2
that  
the  
manhunt  >>>ARG1
for  
high  
Baath  
officials  
in  
the  
Sunni  
heartland  
is  V03
being  V03
done  V02
wrong  <ARGM-MNR
,  
or  
at  
least  
in  
ways  V01
that  >>R-ARG1
are  V01
bad  V04
for  
US  
standing  <ARG2
with  
local  
Iraqis  
.  

Google  >>ARG0
has  V01
finally  >ARGM-TMP

an

day  <ARG1

a  
chance  V02
to  
present  V01
the

the  
(  
miniscule  
number  <ARG2

n't  >ARGM-NEG
heard  V01
it  <ARG1

Usually  >ARGM-ADV

these  >ARG1
are  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
a  
chance  V02
for  
the  
suckups  >ARG0

suck  V04
up  
,  
but  
this  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
people  >>ARG1
are  V01
actually  >ARGM-ADV
concerned  V01
about  
the

They  >ARG0
work  V01
on

"  
Arafat  
's  
secular

compromise  V01

the

along

always  >ARGM-TMP

Shojai  >ARG0
told  V01
the

the

long  
fair  
in  
Tehran

He  >ARG0
added  V01
that  
around  
1,100  
cartoons  >>ARG1

submitted  V01
by  
participants  <ARG0

more

that  
more

He  >ARG0
said  V01
the  
top  
three  
cartoons  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
announced  V01
on  
September  <ARGM-TMP

8,000

5,000

respectively  
.  

This  
cute  >ARGM-ADJ
little  >ARGM-ADJ
stunt  V02
is  V03
only  
going  V04
to  
prove  V01
just  
how  
fanatic  >ARG2
the

When  >ARGM-TMP

a

When  >>ARGM-TMP

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT

it  >ARG0

The

Hundreds  >ARG0

in

Huwaijah

as

according  
to  
az  <<<ARGM-ADV

The  
battles  V01

demonstrations  V01
were  V03
provoked  V01
by  
the  
US  >ARG0
assault  V01
on

In

The  
hottest  
item  >ARG1
on  
Christmas  
wish  
lists  
this  
year  
is  V01
nuclear  
weapons  <ARG2
.  

Al

wants  V01
them  <ARG1
,  
Iran  >ARG0
wants  V01
them  <ARG1
,  
Russia  >ARG0

the  
better  
ones  <ARG1

and  
all  >>ARG1

wants  V01
is  V01
to  
give  V01
them  <ARG2
all  
a  
piece  <ARG1
of  
coal  
.  

For  
the  
last  
few  
years  >>ARGM-TMP
there  
have  V01
been  V02
tensions  V01
with  
Iran  
’s  
nuclear  
program  <ARG0
with  
word  >ARG1
coming  V03
this  
week  <ARGM-TMP
that  
a  
deal  V01
was  V03
reached  V01
through  
the  
European  
Union  <ARGM-MNR
that  >R-ARG1
meets  V05
with  
the  
approval  V01
of  
the  
International  
Atomic  
Energy  
Agency  <ARG1
.  

At  
the  
same  
time  >ARGM-TMP
,  
an  
Iranian  
Opposition  
Group  >ARG0
released  V01
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
call  V01
proof  V01
of  
a  
covert  
nuclear  
weapons  
program  <ARG1
.  

Arial  >ARGM-ADJ

and  
Libya  
make  V07
up  
the  
evidence  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
the  
group  >ARG0
presented  V01
.  

Russia  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
announced  V01
that  
it  >>>ARG0
was  V03
seeking  V01
and  
building  V01
the  
best  
nukes  >>ARG1
the  
world  >>ARG0
’s  V03
ever  >ARGM-TMP
seen  V01
.  

President  >ARG0
Vladimir  
Putin  
said  V01
Russia  >ARG0
is  
will  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
new  
nuclear  
weapons  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
other  
countries  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  
and  
will  
not  
have  V03
.  

With  
the  
demand  V01
so  >ARGM-EXT
high  V02
,  
the  
question  V01
arises  V02
on  
to  
who  >>ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
or  
has  V03
the  
right  V05
to  
be  V01
the  
Santa  <ARG2
of  
nuclear  
weapons  
.  

Right  
now  >ARGM-TMP
that  >>ARG1
seems  V01
to  
be  V01
the  
US  <ARG2
,  
EU  
,  
and  
IAEA  
.  

But  
not  
always  >>ARGM-TMP
do  V01
those  
three  >ARG0
agree  V01
,  
and  
not  
always  >>>ARGM-TMP
are  V01
their  >ARG0
decisions  V01
equal  V01
.  

The  
US  >>ARG0
has  V01
strongly  >ARGM-EXT
opposed  V01
a  
nuclear  
weapons  
program  <ARG1
of  
Iran  
,  
yet  
Israel  >>>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG0
to  
this  
day  >>ARGM-TMP
has  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
officially  >ARGM-MNR
said  V01
that  
they  >ARG0
posses  V01
nuclear  
weapons  <ARG1
,  
ranks  V01
around  
fifth  <ARG2
in  
nuclear  
strength  <ARG4
.  

It  
is  V03
estimated  V01
that  
Israel  >ARG0
has  V03
over  
200  
nuclear  
weapons  <ARG1
yet  
neither  
the  
US  >ARG0
nor  
any  
of  
her  
allies  
expresses  V01
the  
slightest  >ARGM-EXT
concern  V01
.  

North  
Korea  
’s  
Kim  >ARG0
Jong  
Ill  
also  >ARGM-DIS
has  V03
the  
bomb  <ARG1
at  
the  
top  <ARGM-LOC
of  
his  
list  
and  
Santa  >>>ARG1
seems  V01
to  
have  V01
already  >ARGM-TMP
come  V01
a  
few  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >>ARG1
is  V03
rumored  V01
that  
North  
Korea  >ARG0
has  V03
at  
least  
a  
couple  
nuclear  
weapons  <ARG1
.  

But  >>>ARGM-DIS
getting  V05
past  
who  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
them  <ARG1
,  
is  V01
who  >>>ARG1
has  V03
them  <ARG1
,  
and  
who  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
close  V10
.  

The  
case  V03
against  
Iran  <ARG2
has  VLV
a  
feeling  V01
of  
Déjà  
vu  <ARG1
.  

Arial  >ARGM-ADJ
photos  V01
of

uranium  >>>ARG1

,  
somewhat  
like  
those  <<<ARGM-MNR
of  
chemical  
weapons  
stockpiles  
in  
Iraq  
.  

America  >ARG0
cried  V01
wolf  <ARG1
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
what  >>ARG0
’s  V01
scary  V03
is  V01
that  
sooner  >ARGM-TMP
or  
later  
,  
that  
wolf  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
get  V01
us  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
ran  V07
across  
this  
item  <ARG1
on  
the  
Internet  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Sooooo  
.  

The  
United  
States  >>ARG0
goes  V02
into  
a  
war  
zone  <ARG4
and  
evacuates  V01
a  
bunch  >ARG1
of  
U.S.  
citizens  
(  
most  >R-ARG1
of  
whom  
were  V01
"  
dual  
-  
citizens  <ARG2
"  
)  
.  

Then  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
eschewing  V01
normal  >ARGM-ADJ
procedure  V01
,  
the  
Department  >ARG0
of  
State  
waived  V01
the  
fees  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
they  >ARG0
charge  V01
for  
evacuating  V01
U.S.  
citizen  <ARG2
.  

Why  
?  

To  
pander  V01
to  
the  
mythical  
"  
Arab  
street  <ARG1
"  
,  
of  
course  
.  

Now  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
argue  V01
that  
one  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
reasonably  >ARGM-ADV
predicted  V01
that  
some  
form  >>>ARG1
of  
military  
violence  
was  V01
likely  V01
to  
occur  V01
in  
Lebanon  <ARGM-LOC
(  
considering  V02
that  
the  
country  >>>ARG0
has  V01
been  V03
experiencing  V01
some  
form  <ARG1
of  
conflict  V01
for  
approximately  
the  
last  
32  
years  <<ARGM-TMP
)  
.  

In  
other  
words  >ARGM-ADV
,  
those  
Americans  >>>ARG1
were  V01
there  <ARG2
by  
their  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-REC
choice  V01
,  
mired  V01
in  
a  
situation  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
was  V01
totally  >ARGM-EXT
predictable  V02
.  

Yet  >>ARGM-DIS
we  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
charge  V01
them  <ARG2
for  
the  
evacuation  V01
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
unlike  
the  
situation  <ARG2
last  
year  
in  
Asia  
when  
we  >ARG0
evacuated  V01
U.S.  
citizens  <ARG2
from  
areas  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
were  V03
hit  V01
by  
the  
tsunami  V01
-  
a  
phenomenon  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
much  
less  >ARGM-CXN
predictable  V02
than  
the  
Hezbollah  
-  
provoked  >ARGM-CAU
destruction  V01
that  >R-ARG1
rained  V01
down  <ARGM-DIR
on  
Lebanon  <ARG2
.  

And  
what  >>ARG1
do  V01
we  >ARG0
get  V01
for  
this  
effort  V01
?  

A  
lawsuit  
.  

That  >>ARG2
's  V01
right  V06
,  
folks  <ARGM-DIS
.  

The  
American  
-  
Arab  
Discrimination  
Committee  >>>ARG0
is  V03
suing  V02
Condoleeza  <ARG1
Rice  
and  
Donald  
Rumsfeld  
,  
charging  V06
that  
they  >ARG0
mismanaged  V01
the  
evacuation  >ARG1
efforts  V01
.  

Here  >ARG2

an  
excerpt  <ARG1

the  
article

Here  >ARG2

a  
tip  V05
:  
Do  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
get  V03
married  V01
in  
countries  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
house  V01
illegal  
militias  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
attack  V01
other  
countries  <ARG1
and  
hence  >>ARGM-ADV
are  V01
likely  V01
to  
come  V04
under  
counter-attack  <ARG2

Crap  >ARG0
like  
this  
sure  >ARGM-EXT
makes  V02
me  >>>ARG0
want  V01
to  
rush  V01
right  
out  <ARGM-DIR
and  
rescue  V01
people  <ARG1
from  
dilemmas  <ARG2
of  
their  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-REC
making  V01
.  

Though  
I  >>ARG0
am  V01
loathe  >>>ARGM-ADV

quote  V01

writers  <ARG2

At

event  >>ARGM-TMP

Friday  
,  
one  >>ARG1
of

about

wondering  V01

there

a

now  <<ARGM-TMP
about  
memoirs  >>ARG1

what  >ARG1

A

have  V01

I  >>ARG0

the

Ben  >>ARG0
made  VLV
another  
announcement  V01
on  
March  <ARGM-TMP
28  
,  
2005  
:  

I  >>>ARG0
want  V01
to  
use  V01
this  
opportunity  <ARG1
to  
welcome  V01
Brian  <ARG1
Ryner  
to  
Google  <ARG2
!  

Brian  >>ARG1
has  V01
been  V01
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
most  
crucial  
elements  
to  
the  
success  V01
of  
Mozilla

over  
the

few  
years  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
...  

Great  
to  
have  V03
you  <ARG1
on  
board  <ARGM-LOC
!  

Now  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
none  >>>ARG1
of  
this  
has  V01
been  V03
confirmed  V01
by  
Google  <ARG0
at  
the  
present  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
an  
old  
adage  <ARG2
that  
you  >>ARG0
follow  V01
the  
money  <ARG2
to  
see  V01
who  >ARG1
is  V01
behind  
something  <ARG2
.  

In  
this  
case  V04
,  
following  V01
the  
talent  <ARG2
leads  V03
me  >ARG0
to  
think  V01
that  
Google  >>>ARG0
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
making  VLV
an  
announcement  V01
this  
year  <ARGM-TMP
that  >R-ARG0
formalizes  V01
the  
Google  >ARG0
-  
Mozilla  
/  
Firefox  
relationship  V03
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
have  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
already  >ARGM-TMP
seen  V01
the  
Flash  
movie  <ARG1
Epic  
,  
you  >>>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
take  V01
a  
few  
minutes  <ARG1
and  
view  V02
the  
future  
history  <ARG1
of  
media  
as  
conceived  V01
by  
Robin  <ARG0
Sloan  
and  
Matt  
Thompson  
,  
with  
music  <ARGM-ADV
by  
Aaron  
McLeran  
.  

In  
this  
movie  >ARGM-LOC
Google  >ARG0
and  
Amazon  
(  
GOOGLEZON  
)  
create  V01
a  
brave  
new  
world  <ARG1
of  
media  
in  
2008  <ARGM-TMP
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
one  
thought  
-  
provoking  
film  <ARG2
.  

Every  
move  V02
Google  <ARG0
makes  VLV
brings  V01
this  
particular  
future  <ARG1
closer  <ARG3
.  

Just  
one  
small  
commment  
-  
it  
's  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
possible  V01
,  
as  
far  <ARGM-ADV

I  >ARG0

for  
Google  >ARG0

alter  V01
it  <ARG1

and  
release  V01
those  
changes  V01
to  
the  
world  <<ARGM-GOL

this  >ARG1
is  V01
what  >ARG2
the  
whole  
open

about  <C-ARG2

I  >>>ARG0
'm  V01
inclined  V01

say  V01
that

what  <ARG1

can  
to  
both  
shape  V01

admidst  
the  
higher  
echelons  <ARGM-LOC

.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
this

more

to

a  
form  <ARG2

gross

How  >>ARGM-MNR
did  V01
the  
CPA  >ARG1
get  V05
to  
the  
point  >>ARGM-ADV
where  >>R-ARGM-ADV
it  >>ARG0
has  V01
turned  V02
even  
Iraqi  
Shiites  >>ARG0
,  
who  >>R-ARG0
were  V01
initially  >ARGM-TMP
grateful  V01
for  
the  
removal  V01
of  
Saddam  <ARG1
Hussein  
,  
against  
the  
United

?  

Where  >ARGM-ADV
it  >>ARG0
risks  V01
fighting  V01
dual  
Sunni  
Arab  
and  
Shiite  
insurgencies  <ARG1
simultaneously  <ARGM-TMP
,  
at  
a  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
when  >>>R-ARGM-TMP
US  
troops  >>>ARG0
are  V03
rotating  V01
on  
a  
massive  
scale  <ARGM-EXT
and  
hoping  V01
to  
downsize  V01
their  
forces  <ARG1

At  
a

the

and  
the  
UN  >>>ARG1
is  V01
reluctant  V01
to  
get  V03
involved  V01

One  
answer  V01
is  V01
that  
the  
Pentagon  >ARG0
prevented  V01
the  
State  
Department  <ARG1
from  
running  V01
the  
CPA  <ARG1

State  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
body  <ARG2
with  
experience  V01
in  
international  
affairs  <ARG1
and  
administration  V01
.  

The  
civilians  >ARG0
in  
the  
Department  
of  
Defense  
only  >ARGM-ADV
know  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
blow  V06
things  <ARG1
up  <C-V

Rumsfeld  >ARG0
,  
Wolfowitz

Neoconservatives  >>ARG0

had  VLV

no  
Arabic

no  
respect  V01
for  
Muslim  
culture  <ARG1
(  
or  
knowledge  
about  
it  
)  
.  

They  >ARG0
actively  >ARGM-MNR
excluded  V01

)  

The  
Neocons  >ARG0

have  V03
all  
sorts  <ARG1
of  
ulterior  
motives

some

of

and  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
even  >ARGM-ADV
breaking  V08

Commission  
member  
Philip  >>>ARG0
Zelikow  
,  
who  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
close  V10
to  
the  
Bush  >ARG0
administration  V01
,  
admitted  V01
on  
Sept.  <ARGM-TMP
10  
,  
2002  
,  
that  
the  
ulterior  
motive  >>ARG1
of  
the  
Bush  >ARG0
administration  V01
for  
the  
Iraq  
War  
was  V01
to  
"  
protect  V01
Israel  <ARG1
,  
"  
according  
to  
the  
Asian  
Times  <<<ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >>ARG1
have  V01
long  >ARGM-TMP
been  V01
a  
trenchant  
critic  <ARG2
of  
the  
Sadrists  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG1
have  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
been  V01
up  
to  
anything  <ARG2
extraordinary  
as  
far  <ARGM-ADV
as  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
in  
recent  
weeks  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Someone  >>ARG0
in  
the  
CPA  
sat  V02
down  
and  
thought  V02
up  
ways  V01
to  
stir  V02
them  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-PRD
by  
closing  V01
their  
newspaper  <ARG1
and  
issuing  V01
28  
arrest  
warrants  <ARG1
and  
taking  V06
in  
people  <ARG1
like  
Yaqubi  
.  

This  >>>ARG1
is  V01
either  
gross  
incompetence  <ARG2
or  
was  V03
done  V02
with  
dark  
ulterior  
motives  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
scarcely  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V03
guessed  V01
at  <C-ARG1
.  

There  
is  V02
a  
classical  
logical  
fallacy  <ARG1
,  
post  
hoc  
ergo  
propter  
hoc  
(  
Z  >ARG1
happens  V01
after  
X  <ARGM-TMP
,  
therefore  >>ARGM-ADV
Z  >>ARG1
is  V03
caused  V01
by  
X  <ARG0
)  
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
keep  V02
revising  V01
this  
posting  V01
this  
evening  <<ARGM-TMP
because  
I  >>>ARG1
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
fall  V10
into  
it  <ARG2
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
sometimes  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
of  >>ARGM-ADV
course  
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
Z  >ARG1
happens  V01
after  
X  <ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
is  V01
because  
of  
X  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
as  >ARGM-ADV
well  
just  >ARGM-ADV
come  V09
out  
with  
it  <ARG1
:  
It  
is  V01
pretty  
suspicious  <ARG2
,  
given  
the  
Neocon  
predominance  <ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
CPA  
and  
in  
the  
upper  
reaches  
of  
the  
Defense  
Department  
that  
on  
April  >ARGM-TMP
2  
AP  >ARG0
reported  V01
of  
Muqtada  <ARG1
:  

'  
A  
radical

"

in  
Iraq

"  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
said  V01
and  
I  >ARG0
repeat  V01
my  >ARG0
expression  V01
of  
solidarity  >>ARGM-ADV
which  >R-ARG1
Hassan  >ARG0
Nasrallah  
called  V03
for  <C-ARG1
to  
stand  V11
with  
Hamas  <ARGM-COM
,  
"  
Shiite  
cleric  
Muqtada  >ARG0

Friday  <ARGM-TMP
in  
a  
reference  V01
to  
Nasrallah  <ARG1

the  
leader  
of  
the  
militant  
Lebanese  
Shiite  
group  
Hezbollah  
.  

Last  
month  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Nasrallah  >ARG0
announced  V01
that  
his  
party  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
close  V01
ranks  <ARG1
with  
Hamas  <ARG2
.  

"  
Let  V01
(  
Hamas  >ARG0
)  
consider  V01
me  <ARG1
their  
striking  
arm  <ARG1
in  
Iraq  
because  
the  
fate  >ARG1
of  
Iraq  
and  
Palestine  
is  V01
the  
same  <ARG2
,  
"  
al  >ARG0
-  
Sadr  
said  V01
during  
a  
Friday  
prayer  
sermon  <ARGM-TMP
in  
Kufa  
,  
his  
home  
base  
south  
of  
Baghdad  
.  

He  >>ARG0
did  V01
comment  V01
on  
what  >ARG2
he  >ARG0
meant  V01
by  
the  
phrase  <ARG1
.  
'  

And  
on  
April  >>ARGM-TMP
3  
his  
chief  
aide  >>ARG1
in  
Najaf  
was  V03
suddenly  >ARGM-TMP
arrested  V01

with  
13  
other  
members  <ARGM-ADV

his  
organization  
,

put  V01
into  
violent  >ARGM-MNR

his  
organization  <ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG0
leaves  V13
7  
US  
soldiers  <ARG1
dead  <ARG1
.  

The  
Army  >>>ARG0
is  V01
unlikely  V01
to  
forgive  V01
or  
forget  V01
;  
but  
who  >ARG0
provoked  V01
it  <ARG1
and  
why  
?  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
even  <ARGM-ADV
in  
Iraq  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
predicted  V01
to  
you  <ARGM-GOL
the  
consequences  <ARG1
of  
doing  V02
what  >>>ARG1
the  
CPA  >>>ARG0
has  V01
been  V03
doing  V02
.  

Anthony  >ARG0
Shadid  
of

that

been  V03

All  
:  

It  
is  V01
my  >ARG0
understanding  V01
,  
from  
good  
sources  <<ARGM-DIR
in  
the

the

The

that  
if

suspend  V01
everyone  >ARG1
's  
right  V05
to  
bilateral  
contracts  <ARG2
quickly  <<ARGM-MNR

it  >ARG0
sets  V03
up  
a

all  >R-ARG0
bid  V01
higher  <ARGM-ADJ
than  
ENA  
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
mentioned  V01
we  >ARG1
were  V01
a  
close  
sixth  >>ARG1
,  
that  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
close  V10
to  
the  
fifth

bid  V01
.  

He  >>ARG0
gave  VLV
no  >ARGM-NEG
indication  V01
on  
the  
value  <ARG1

you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
pack  V01

How  >ARG2

your

Our

My  
old

got  V03
tossed  V01

How  >>ARGM-MNR

to

that  
I  >ARG0
thought  V01
the  
people  >>ARG0
profiled  V01

should  >ARGM-MOD
pull  V01
their

out  
of  
their  
self  
important

.  

It  >>ARG0
is  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
about  
finding  V01
the  
meaning  V01
of  
life  <ARG1
at  
work  V01
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
all  
about  
the  
$$$  <ARG2
.  

Work  V01
hard  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Make  V05
$$$  <ARG1

Retire  V01

Moving

about  
a

which  >R-ARG1

a  
little  
sooner  <ARG2

I  >ARG0
thought  V01
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD

going  V02
back  <ARG4

when  >ARGM-TMP

knocks  V01
you  >>ARG0

I  >>ARG0

n't  >ARGM-NEG
hear  V01

We  >ARG1

fit  V01
into  
certain  
parts  <ARG2
of  
the

There  
are  V02
a  
few  
life  
theories  >ARG1

that  
which  >R-ARG1

have  VLV
a

more  >ARGM-EXT
respect  V01

I  >>>ARG0

thinking  V01
of  
converting  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
a  
hover  
vehicle  <ARG2

I  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
just  >>ARGM-ADV
sell  V01
the  
car  <ARG1
and  
get  V04
you  >ARG0
to  
drive  V01
me  <ARG1
around  <ARGM-PRD
all

How  
about  
skidoo

for  
the

tracks

the

Your

has  V01
been  V01
the

an

could  >ARGM-MOD

It  >>>ARG1

However  >ARGM-DIS

the  
result  >ARG1
from  
Ordinary  
Least  
Squares  
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG

expected  V01
due  
to  
different  >ARGM-ADJ

The

followed  V04
:  

Intercept  
:

the

Thanks  V01
for  
the  
message  <ARG2
regarding  
a  
possible  
intern  
for  
your  
group  
.  

Right  
now  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
we  >>>ARG0
are  V01
in  
the  
process  V02
of  
evaluating  V01
both  
our  >ARG0
new  
hire  >ARG1
needs  V01
and  
our  >ARG0
summer  >ARGM-TMP
needs  V01
and  
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
making  VLV
those  
decisions  V01
after  
the  
first  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
year  
.  

Until  
we  >>ARG0
have  V01
come  V11
up  
with  
those  
numbers  <ARG1
it  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
premature  V01
to  
make  VLV
any  
offers  V01
for  
the  
summer  <ARGM-TMP
.  

What  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
do  V02
in  
this  
case  <ARGM-ADV
is  V01
get  V01
the  
information  <ARG1
to  
Jeff  >>ARG0
Davis  
,  
who  >>R-ARG0
is  V01
responsible  V03
for  
Georgia  
Tech  <ARG1
and  
ask  V02
him  >>ARG0
to  
get  V01
Sungjoo  
's  
resume  <ARG1
and  
start  V01
a  
file  <ARG1
on  
him  
with  
a  
notation  V01
that  
you  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
hire  V01
him  <ARG1
for  
summer  <ARGM-TMP
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
start  V01
the  
summer  >ARGM-TMP
process  V02
,  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
interview  V01
the  
candidate  <ARG1
and  
slot  
him  
for  
your  
group  
.  

Is  V01
this  <ARG1
okay  <ARG2
with  
you  
?  

Hope  V01
all  >>ARG1
is  V01
well  V09
with  
you  <ARGM-GOL

Take  VLV
Care  V03

Traci  
,  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
visited  V01
Georgia  
Tech  <ARG1
on  
Thursday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

One  >ARG0
of  
the  
students  
indicated  V01
that  
he  >>ARG1
is  V01
interested  V01
in  
a  
summer  
internship  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG1
came  V15
across  
as  
a  
very  
bright  
person  <ARG3
,  
very  
personable  
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
take  V01
him  <ARG1
as  
a  
summer  
intern  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Vince  

Dear  
Dr.  
Vincent  
Kaminski  
,  

Hi  
.  

How  >>ARGM-MNR
are  V03
you  >ARG0
doing  V02
?  

I  >ARG0
hope  V01
you  >>ARG1
have  VLV
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
flight  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
to  
home  
.  

It  
was  V01
a  
good  
opportunity  <ARG2
to  
know  V01
about  
Enron  <ARG1
and  
its  
finance  
sector  
.  

Thank  V01
you  <ARG1
for  
your  
time  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
already  >ARGM-TMP
submitted  V01
my  
resume  <ARG1
and  
cover  
letter  
right  
after  
the  
talk  V01
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >ARG0
ask  V02
me  >ARG0
to  
send  V01
a  
copy  V01
of  
resume  <ARG1
and  
cover  
letter  
again  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Those  
attachments  V01
are  V01
what  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG2
was  V03
asked  V02
.  

Again  >ARGM-ADV
,  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
chance  V02
for  
me  >>ARG0
to  
get  V22
to  
know  V01
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
in  
this  
field  <ARGM-LOC
and  
what  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
more  >ARGM-EXT
focus  V01
on  <C-ARG2
in  
school  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
am  V03
looking  V03
forward  
to  
hearing  V01
from  
you  <ARG2
soon  <ARGM-TMP
and  
have  V03
a  
nice  
day  <ARG1
.  

Thank  V01
you  <ARG1
.

This

the  
tax  
basis  >>>ARG1

As

distributing  V01

(

prefer  V01
to  
settle  V02
the

a

,  
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
distribute  V01

.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
let  V01
me  >ARG0

As

we  >>>ARG0
have  V03
a  
CPA  >>>ARG0

Larry  
Lewis

working  V01

the

If  
you  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD

we  >>>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
set  V03
up  
a

Please  >ARGM-DIS

Renee

Thank  V01
you  <ARG1

digging  V01
in  <ARG2
to  
the  
issue  V02
of  
Deferred  V01

It  
is  V01
clear  V06
that  
the

will  
be  V03
made  VLV
in  
shares  V01
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
understand  V01
which  
date  >>>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
used  V01
to  
determine  V01
the  
value  <ARG1
and  
calculate  V01
how  
many  >ARGM-EXT
shares  V01
.  

The  
plan  
document  
under

Amount  >ARG1
of

reads  V01
"  
The  
value  >>>ARG1
of  
the

and  
resulting  V01
payment  
amount  <ARG2

be  V03
based  V02
on  
the  
closing  >ARGM-PRD

common  
stock  <ARG1
on  
the

such  >ARGM-ADJ

be  V03
made  VLV

"  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
help  V01
me  >>>ARG0
interpret  V01
this  
statement  V01
and  
work  V06
through  
the

my

Let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
get  V01
the  
quotes  V01
from  
Pauline  <<ARG2
.  

I  >>>ARG0
am  V03
expecting  V01
to  
pay  V01
something  <ARG1
in  
the  
$  
3,  
to  
$  
5,000  
range  
.  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
see  V01
the  
quotes  V01
and  
a  
description  V01
of  
the  
work  V01
to  
be  V03
done  V02
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
my  >ARG0
understanding  V01
that  
some  
rock  >>>ARG1
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
removed  V01
and  
replaced  V01
with  
siding  <ARG2
.  

If  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
getting  V01
quotes  V01
to  
put  V01
up  <ARG2
new  
rock  <ARG1
then  >ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
to  
clarify  V10
.  

Jacques  >>>ARG0
is  V01
ready  V02
to  
drop  V07
in  <ARGM-PRD
a  
dollar  
amount  <ARG1
on  
the  
release  V01
.  

If  
the  
negotiations  V01
stall  V01
,  
it  >ARG1
seems  V01
like  
I  >>>ARG0
need  V01
to  
go  V06
ahead  <ARG2
and  
cut  V04
off  
the  
utilities  <ARG1
.  

Hopefully  >ARGM-ADV
things  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
go  V06
smoothly  <ARGM-MNR

Take  VLV

COMPLETE  
ARTICLE  
AT  
:  
http://discountairlineticket.blogspot.com/2005/10/some-techniques-to-...  

Several  
years  
ago  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
developed  V02
a  
short  >ARGM-ADJ
paper  >ARGM-MNR
and  
pencil  
screening  >ARGM-ADJ
test  V01
which  >>R-ARG0
,  
in  
a  
small  >ARGM-ADJ
pilot  >ARGM-ADJ
study  V01
,  
discriminated  V01
between  
ADHD  <ARG1
,  
LD  
,  
and  
control  
subjects  
.  

I  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
converted  V01
this  
test  V01
to  
an  
online  >ARGM-ADJ
test  V01
in  
order  
to  
norm  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
a  
larger  >ARGM-ADJ
population  V01
and  
,  
subsequently  >ARGM-TMP
,  
to  
make  V02
it  >ARG2
available  V02
to  
any  
one  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
has  V03
access  V01
to  
a  
computer  <ARG1
and  
the  
Internet  
.  

The  
test  V01
itself  <ARGM-REC
is  V01
what  >>ARG1
is  V03
called  V01
a  
substitution  >ARG2
test  V01
.  

It  >ARG0
has  V03
two  
parts  >>ARG1
,  
both  >>R-ARG1
of  
which  
are  V03
timed  V01
for  
90  
seconds  <ARG2
each  
and  
the  
differential  >>>ARG0
between  
the  
resulting  V01
two  
scores  V01
determines  V01
the  
likelihood  <ARG1
of  
having  V03
a  
learning  
disability  <ARG1
or  
attention  
deficit  
disorder  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
am  V01
in  
need  V01
of  
test  
subjects  <ARG1
and  
hope  V01
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
take  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

The  
test  V01
,  
along  
with  
an  
information  
form  <ARGM-ADJ
,  
is  V01
available  V02
at  <ARGM-LOC
:  
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
a  
test  V01
like  
this  
one  <ARGM-ADJ
is  V03
much  >ARGM-EXT
needed  V01
.  

A  
person  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
take  V01
it  <ARG1
directly  <ARGM-MNR
instead  
of  
others  >ARG0
completing  V01
behavioral  
checklists  <ARG1
or  
a  
completing  V01
a  
lengthy  >ARGM-ADJ
program  
intensive  >ARGM-ADJ
test  V01
like  
TOVA  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

Perhaps  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>>ARG0
are  V01
willing  V02
to  
recommend  V01
this  
site  <ARG1
and  
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
website  <ARG1

place  V01
a

on  
your

are  V02
there  
any  
sadists  >ARG0
out  
there  <ARGM-LOC
who  >R-ARG0
share  V01
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
tastes  V01
as  
i  
do  V01
?  

i  >>ARG0
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
but  
since  
a  
very  
young  
age  >>>ARGM-TMP
i  >>>ARG1
have  V01
had  VLV
a  
strange  >ARGM-ADJ
but  
very  
gratifying  
urge  V01
to  
torture  V01
or  
maime  V01
animals  <ARG1
.  

i  >>ARG1
am  V01
deadly  >ARGM-ADV
serious  V01
,  
i  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
get  V01
sexual  
releif  <ARG1
from  
even  >ARGM-ADV
hearing  V01
of  
torture  V01
of  
animals  <ARG1
,  
now  >ARGM-TMP
some  
people  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
call  V01
me  <ARG1
a  
brute  <ARG2
or  
a  
coward  
but  
i  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
help  V02
my  >ARG0
true  >ARGM-ADJ
feelings  V01
.  

badger  >ARG1
baiting  V02
is  V01
natrually  <ARGM-ADV
a  
huge  >ARGM-EXT
turn  
on  V_
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
i  >ARG0
thought  V01
a  
few  
words  >ARG0
in  
this

might  >ARGM-MOD
uncover  V01
some

sincere  
appologies  
to  
anyone  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG1

offended  V01
by

my  >ARG0

is  V01
genuine  V01

Once  
upon  
a  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
(  
in  
2001  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
to  
be  V01
specific  <ARG2
)  
,  
the  
Coca  
-  
Cola  
corporation  >ARG0
built  V01
a  
bottling  
plant  <ARG1
in  
a  
small  
and  
remote  
Indian  
village  <ARGM-LOC
in  
the  
state  
of  
Kerala  
.  

In  
exchange  V01
for  
sucking  V01
vast  
amounts  <ARG1
of  
water  
out  
of  
the  
local  
land  <ARG2
,  
the  
mighty  
corporation  >>ARG0
promised  V01
to  
bring  V01
the  
people  <ARG2
great  
wealth  <ARG1
.  

But  
within  
a  
few  
short  
months  >ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
village  
people  >>ARG0
began  V02
to  
notice  V01
their  
wells  >>ARG1
were  V03
running  V01
dry  <ARGM-PRD
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG0
complained  V01
to  
the  
corporation  <ARG2
.  

Coca  
-  
Cola  >>>ARG0
calmed  V01
the  
concerns  V01
of  
the  
people  <ARG1
and  
attempted  V01
to  
win  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
their  
favor  <ARG1
by  
giving  V01
them  <ARG2
vast  
amounts  <ARG1
of  
free  
fertilizer  
,  
saying  V01
it  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
grow  V03
bountiful  
crops  <ARG1
beyond  
their  >ARG0
wildest  >ARGM-ADJ
dreams  V01
.  

After  
several  
years  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
use  V01
,  
we  >ARG1
arrive  V01
at  
the  
present  
day  >>ARGM-TMP
when  >>R-ARGM-TMP
the  
village  
people  >>ARG0
have  V01
suddenly  >ARGM-TMP
discovered  V01
the  
fertilizer  >>ARG1
is  V01
actually  <ARGM-ADV
the  
bottling  
plant  
's  
waste  
sludge  <ARG2
and  
is  V01
laden  <ARG2
with  
cadmium  
,  
a  
highly  
toxic  
,  
cancer  
-  
causing  
heavy  
metal  
.  

The  
village  
soil  >>>ARG0
and  
water  
are  V03
now  >ARGM-TMP
too  
heavily  >ARGM-EXT
contaminated  V01
to  
safely  >ARGM-MNR
occupy  V01
human  
life  <ARG1
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
plant  >>ARG1
was  V03
shut  V05
down  
last  
week  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Moral  
of  
the  
story  
:  
Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
drink  V01
Coke  <ARG1
..........  
drink  V01
Pepsi  <ARG1
!

it  >ARG1

It  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD

You  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03

They  >>>ARG1

If  
you  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD

wait  V01
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
book  V03
an  
earlier  >ARGM-TMP

where  >ARGM-LOC
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0

morcillas  <ARG1

I  >ARG0
will  
to

I  >ARG0
searched  V01

find  V01
all  
across  
the

reasons  <ARGM-PRP
by  
the

matter  <ARGM-ADV
what  >ARG1
the  
liberal  
revisionist  
historians  >ARG0
tell  V01
you  <ARG2
)  
.  

What  >ARG2
is  V01
your  
cat  
s  
name  <ARG1
and  
why  >>ARGM-CAU
did  V01
you  >ARG0
name  V01
him  <ARG1
/  
her  
that  <ARG2
?  

If  
you  >ARG0
HAVE  V03
a  
cat  <ARG1
of  <ARGM-ADV
course  
.  

My  
cat  
s  
name  >ARG1

Twinky  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
tiny  
little  
kitten  >ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG0
looked  V02
like  
those  
twinky  
snack  
cakes  <ARG1
.  

She  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
creme  
tabby  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
had  V03
her  <ARG1
for  
over  
2  
years  <ARGM-TMP
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG1
have  V01
a  
siamese  
lynx  >C-ARG1
name  V01
Star  <ARG2
we  >ARG0
called  V01
her  <ARG1
that  <ARG2
because  
she  >ARG0
has  V03
a  
star  
pattern  <ARG1
on  
her  
face  <ARGM-LOC
.  

And  
she  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
STAR  <ARG2
of  
the  
family  
.  

I  >ARG0
love  V01
her  <ARG1
.  
:)  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
Norwegian  
Forest  
Cat  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is  V03
named  V01
Achilles  <ARG2
bc  
as  
a  
kitten  >ARGM-PRD
he  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
attacked  V01
your  
feet  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
walked  V01
by  <ARGM-DIR
!  

My  
cat  >>ARG1
s  V03
Called  V01
Frank  <ARG2
because  
the  
year  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
got  V01
him  <ARG1
was  V01
the  
year  >ARGM-TMP
Frank  >ARG1
Sinatra  
died  V01

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
had  V03
bright  
blue  
eyes  <ARG1
like  
Frank  >ARG0
Sinatra  
did  V02
:)  

what  >>ARG2
does  V01
it  >ARG0
mean  V01
when  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
veiled  
chameleon  
egg  >>ARG1
is  V01
soft  V02
?  

my  
female  
chameleon  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
laid  V01
eggs  <ARG1
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
and  
today  >>ARGM-TMP
some  >>ARG1
of  
the  
eggs  
are  V01
soft  V02
when  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
mean  V01
soft  <ARG2
i  >ARG0
mean  V01
like  <ARGM-DIS
not  
like  
ordinary  
chameleon  
eggs  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG1
are  V01
probably  <ARGM-ADV
infertile  <ARG2
.  

If  
there  
is  V02
no  
male  <ARG1
they  >ARG1
are  V01
probably  <ARGM-ADV
infertile  <ARG2
!  

If  
you  >>ARG0
take  V01
a  
flash  
light  <ARG1
and  
shine  V01
it  <ARG1
through  
the  
eggs  <ARGM-DIR
and  
you  >ARG0
see  V01
nothing  <ARG1
throw  V07
them  <ARG1
away  <C-V
!  

If  
you  
do  V01
not  
they  >>ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
start  V01
to  
rot  V01
!  

If  
she  >ARG0
has  V03
no  
male  >ARG0
to  
fertilize  V01
the  
eggs  <ARG1
,  
the  
eggs  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
aways  >ARGM-ADV
be  V01
infertile  <ARG2
.  

if  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
have  V03
a  
male  <ARG1
but  
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
in  
the  
same  
cage  <ARG2
or  
breeding  V01
but  
you  >ARG0
touch  V01
him  <ARG1
then  
her  
she  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
smell  V01
his  
sent  <ARG1
and  
probably  >ARGM-ADV
lay  V01
eggs  <ARG1
.  

Hope  V01
she  >>ARG0
stops  V01
laying  V01
eggs  <ARG1
because  
she  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
get  V03
really  <ARG2
skinny  <ARG2
!  

If  
she  >ARG0
continues  V01
!  

Hope  V01
this  >ARG0
helps  V01

It  >ARG1
's  V01
an  
amazing  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
!  

Is  V01
it  <ARG1
better  V02
to  
book  V03
a  
cruise  <ARG1
online  <ARGM-MNR
or  
by  
a  
travel  
agent  
?  

First  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
go  V02
on  
A  
cruise  <ARG1
any  
and  
all  
info  >>ARG1
is  V03
appreciated  V02

Personally  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
find  V02
a  
travel  
agent  >ARG1
to  
be  V01
of  
value  <ARG2
to  
me  
as  
I  >>>ARG0
am  V01
willing  V02
to  
put  V05
in  
the  
time  <ARG1
doing  VLV
research  V01
on  
the  
internet  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
not  >>ARGM-NEG
had  VLV
good  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
with  
travel  
agents  <ARG1
.  

They  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem  V01
to  
know  V01
anything  <ARG1
but  
the  
hype  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG2
are  V03
told  V01
and  
the  
packages  >>ARG2
they  >ARG0
have  V03
available  V02
to  
them  <ARG1
.  

The  
one  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
booked  V03
through  
a  
travel  
agent  <ARGM-MNR
I  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
all  <ARG1
of  
the  
amenities  >>ARG3
I  >>ARG0
had  V01
paid  V01
for  <C-ARG3
.  

The  
few  
times  >>>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
consulted  V01
with  
a  
travel  
agent  <ARG1
I  >>>ARG0
was  V01
able  V01
to  
find  V01
the  
same  <ARG1
for  
less  <ARGM-ADV
on  
my  
own  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
more  
options  <C-ARG1
than  
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
were  V03
selling  V01
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
now  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
bother  V02
with  
them  <ARG1
at  
all  <ARGM-EXT
.  

best  >ARG1
is  V01
using  V01
an  
online

help  V01

i  >ARG0
want  V01
something  <ARG1
cheap  
east  
to  
take  VLV
care  V03
of  <ARG1
and  
something  >ARG1
to  
hopefully  >ARGM-ADV
fit  V01
in  
my  
room  <ARGM-LOC

no  
pet  >>ARG1
is  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
easy  V05
to  
take  VLV
care  V03
of  <ARG1
.  

they  >ARG0
all  
need  V01
love  V01
and  
attn  
,  
food  
,  
proper  
surroundings  
etc  
.  

the  
easiest  
thing  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
fish  <ARG2
-  
but  
u  >>>ARG0
need  V01
to  
clean  V01
the  
tank  <ARG1
weekly  <ARGM-TMP
,  
feed  V01
it  <ARG2
the  
right  
amt  <ARGM-EXT
,  
etc  <ARGM-ADV
etc  <ARGM-ADV
x  

Having  V03
a  
pet  <ARG1
is  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
easy  V05
.  

You  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
treat  V01
all  
pets  <ARG1
like  
children  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG0
require  V01
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
attention  V02
or  
they  >>ARG0
get  V03
fussy  <ARG2
and  
tear  V04
stuff  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
want  V01
easy  <ARG1
then  >ARGM-ADV
go  V03
with  
a  
gold  
fish  <ARG1
or  
hamster  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
go  V03
with  
a  
small  
rodent  <ARG1
such  
as  
a  
mouse  
,  
rat  
,  
hamster  
or  
gerbil  
if  
you  >ARG0
want  V01
something  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
handle  V01
and  
hold  V01
.  

Fish  >ARG1
are  V01
probably  <ARGM-ADV
the  
easiest  >>ARG1
to  
take  VLV
care  V03
of  <C-ARG1
though  <<<ARGM-DIS
.  

french  
male  
sensuality  
?  

I  >>>ARG0
ve  V01
been  V03
dating  V02
a  
man  <ARG1
from  
brittany  
france  
for  
a  
couple  <ARGM-TMP
of  
months  
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >>ARG1
's  V03
been  V01
away  <ARG2
for  
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
thinking  V01
of  
waiting  V01
for  
him  <ARG2
in  
his  
apartment  <ARGM-LOC
wearing  V01
only  <ARGM-ADV
his  
dress  
shirt  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
s  V01
still  <ARGM-TMP
a  
fairly  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
relationship  V03
and  
we  >>>ARG0
have  V01
nt  >>ARGM-NEG
had  VLV
sex  V01
yet  <ARGM-TMP
so  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
s  V01
kind  <ARGM-ADV
of  
a  
big  >ARGM-ADJ
deal  V03
.  

I  >>>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
freak  V02
him  <ARG1
out  <C-V
or  
make  V02
him  >>ARG1
feel  V01
uncomfortable  V01
.  

Is  V01
it  <ARG1
ok  <ARG2
for  
a  
woman  >>ARG0
in  
french  
culture  >>ARGM-LOC
to  
make  VLV
the  
first  >ARGM-TMP
move  V02
?  

What  
do  V01
french  
men  >ARG0
find  V02
sexy  <ARG1
?  

French  
women  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
ones  >ARG0
to  
say  V01
yes  <ARG1
,  
the  
way  V01
we  >ARG0
say  V01
it  <ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
usually  <ARGM-ADV
as  
straigthforward  <ARG2
as  
you  >ARG0
propose  V01
to  
do  V01
.  

Why  >ARGM-CAU
not  >ARGM-NEG
wait  V01
for  
him  <ARG2
in  
a  
sexy  
dress  <ARGM-ADV
with  
lunch  <ARGM-ADV
or  
dinner  
,  
or  
a  
light  
snack  
at  
his  
house  <ARGM-LOC
.  

And  
you  >ARG0
take  V01
it  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-PRD
from  
there  <ARG2
.  

Just  >ARGM-ADV
make  V02
sure  V01
that  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
light  
meal  <ARG2
with  
little  
alcohol  
.

Like  V01

There

a

VERY  >ARGM-EXT
dishonest  V01

have  V11
yet  <ARG1
to  
hear  V01

How  
much  
better  >>ARG2

I  >ARG0
loved  V01
the  
atmosphere  <ARG1
here  
and  
the  
food  >>ARG1
is  V01
good  V02
,  
however  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
tables  >>ARG1
are  V01
so  >ARGM-CXN
close  V10
together  <ARG2
that  
it  >ARG0
feels  V01
very  
cramped  <ARG1
.  

We  >>>ARG1
were  V03
made  V02
to  
feel  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
welcome  V01

not  >>ARGM-NEG
being  V03
hassled  V01

there  >ARGM-TMP
when  >R-ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
did  V02
a  
free  
raffle  <ARG1
in  
August  <ARGM-TMP

I  >ARG0
won  V01
a  
hard  
drive  <ARG1
!  

The  
reason  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
go  V02
back  <ARG4
is  V01
because  
the  
employees  >>ARG1

sooooo  >ARGM-EXT

The  
one  
guy  >>>ARG1
who  >R-ARG1
was  V01
there  <ARG2
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
guessing  V01
was  V01
the  
owner  <ARG2
,  
was  V01
probably  <ARGM-ADV
the  
least  
helpful  
person  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
met  V02

when  >>ARGM-TMP
Alan  >>ARG0

on  
my

,  
Chuck  >>>ARG0
came  V01
right  
out  <ARGM-DIR

saw  V01
the  
problem  <ARG1
and  
did  V02
what  >ARG1
Alan  
's  
mechanic  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
.  

He  >ARG0
worked  V01
on  
it  <ARG1
right  
on  
the  
back  <ARGM-LOC
of  
my  
car  
.  

I  >>ARG1
am  V01
extremely  >ARGM-ADV
pleased  V01

Quick  
and  
Cheap  

Walked  V01
in  <ARG2
and  
was  V01
out  
ta  
there  <ARG2
in  
10  
mins  <ARGM-TMP
with  
a  
really  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
deal  V01
i  >ARG0
thought  V01
i  >>>ARG0
was  V03
going  V04
to  
be  V03
paying  V01
a  
lot  <ARG1
because  
i  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
DUI  <ARG1
but  
with  
my  
DUI  >>ARGM-ADV
and  
Sr  
-  
22  
they  >>>ARG0
were  V01
able  V01
to  
get  V01
me  <ARG4
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
deal  V01
out  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
service  
office  <ARG2

This  >>>ARG0
is  V01
a  
delivery  
office  <ARG2
only  
and  
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
take  V01
walk  
ins  <ARG1
but  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
have  V03
a  
blue  
box  <ARG1
out  
front  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Glad  
I  >ARG0
called  V02
before  
I  >ARG1
arrived  V01
with  
my  
box  >ARG1
to  
ship  V01
.  

Thought  V01
adding  V02
a  
comment  V01
would  >ARGM-MOD
save  V01
someone  <ARG2
the  
hassle  V02
with  
a  
useless  >ARGM-ADJ
trip  V03
there  <ARG1
.  

the  
food  >ARG1
is  V01
mediocre  <ARG2
at  
best  <ARGM-ADV
.  

the  
waitress  >>ARG0
took  V01
my  
name  <ARG1
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
called  V01
me  <ARG1
that  <ARG2
all  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

not  
sure  
how  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
feel  V01
about  
that  
one  <ARG2
.  

it  >ARG1
's  V01
passable  <ARG2
as  
a  
pub  <ARGM-ADV
,  
but  
the  
pizza  >>ARG1
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
that  >ARGM-EXT
great  V01
.  

if  
you  >ARG0
want  V01
good  
pizza  <ARG1
,  
go  V02
to  
famoso  <ARG4
.  

seriously  
.  

Anyone  >ARG0
else  
find  V02
it  <ARG1
a  
little  
suspicious  <ARG1
that  
there  
are  V02
not  
only  <ARGM-ADV
20  
reviews  V01
for  
this  
dentist  <ARG1
(  
a  
HUGE  
number  
compared  
to  
the  
others  
in  
the  
area  
)  
,  
but  
that  
they  >ARG0
all  
have  V03
the  
same  
unique  
grammar  
structure  <ARG1
?  

And  >ARGM-DIS
they  >>>ARG1
seem  V01
to  
be  V03
posted  V01
at  
fairly  
regular  
intervals  <ARGM-TMP
?  

Best  
YET  
!  

We  >ARG0
go  V02
to  
Japaneiro  <ARG4

all  
the  
time  <ARGM-TMP
and

NEVER  >>ARGM-NEG

Wait

is  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
ready  V02
to  
help  V01
if  
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
decide  V01
(  
which  >ARG1
happens  V01
every  
time  <ARGM-TMP

He  >>>ARG0

took  V01
the  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
explain  V01
the  
repairs  V01
to  
me  <<ARG2

The  
work  V01
on  
my  
car  <ARG1
was  V03
done  V08
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
I  >ARG0
felt  V02
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
trust  V02
his  >ARG0
work  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
nothing  <ARG1
but  
fantastic  
things  >ARG1
to  
say  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
his  
shop  <ARG1
.  

Best  
in  
Memphis  

This  
shop  >ARG1
is  V01
by  
far  <ARGM-EXT
the  
best  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG1
have  V01
been  V01
to  <C-ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
Saab  >>ARGM-LOC
...  
which  >>R-ARGM-LOC
everything  >>ARG1
is  V01
expensive  V02
on  <C-ARGM-LOC
and  
they  >>>ARG1
have  V01
been  V01
extrememly  >ARGM-ADV
fair  V01
and  
price  V01
a  
lot  
lower  
than  
any  
other  
shop  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
called  V02
.  

They  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
only  
place  >ARG3
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
take  V01
my  
car  <ARG1
peiod  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Took  V01
a  
laptop  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
for  
a  
video  
cable  >>ARG1
to  
be  V03
replaced  V01
.  

Everything  >ARG1
except  
the  
display  
worked  V09
fine  <ARGM-MNR
before  
I  >ARG0
took  V01
it  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
.  

The  
video  
cable  >>ARG1
was  V03
replaced  V01
and  
suddenly  >ARGM-TMP
the  
motherboard  >ARG1
was  V01
dead  <ARG2
.  

Phone  >ARGM-MNR
calls  V02
were  V03
n't  >ARGM-NEG
returned  V02
when  >ARGM-TMP
promised  V01
and  
the  
botched  V01
repair  V01
took  V10
a  
week  
longer  <ARG1
than  
promised  V01
.  

We  >>ARG1
have  V01
stayed  V01
at  
Tanglewood  <ARG3
for  
many  
years  <ARGM-TMP
now

We  >ARG0
go  V02
over  <ARGM-TMP
about  
5  
times  <ARGM-TMP

.  

The  
lowest

Dentist  >ARG1

If  
possible  >ARGM-ADV

myself  <<ARGM-GOL

I  >ARG0
bring  V01
in  <ARG3
my  
son  <ARG1
.  

Drs.  >ARG0
Ali  
work  V01
wonders  V02
.  

Neither  
me  >>ARG0
nor  
my  
son  
have  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
had  V03
a  
single  
cavity  <ARG1
since  
we  >ARG0
started  V01
dental  >ARGM-ADJ
care  V03
there  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
team  
focus  >ARG1
is  V01
prevention  V01
and  
education  V01
.  

That  >ARG0
alone  
makes  V02
them  >ARG1
unique  V01
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
your  
usual  
cheap  
hotdog  
place  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG0
offer  V01
a  
large  
variety  <ARG1
of  
quality  
hotdogs  
and  
hamburgers  
They  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
offer  V01
veggie  
dogs  <ARG1

fries  >ARG1
are  V01
of  
good  
quality  <ARG2
,  
the  
staff  >>ARG1
is  V01
friendly  V01
.  

The  
atmosphere  >ARG1
is  V01
your  
typical  
indie  
outfit  <ARG2
with  
old  
movie  
posters  <ARGM-ADV
and  
memorabilia  
from  
the  
70's  
and  
80's  
.  

Over  >ARGM-EXT
charged  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
used  V01
my  
card  <ARG1
to  
purchase  V01
a  
meal  <ARG1
on  
the  
menu  
and  
the  
total  >ARG1
on  
my  
receipt  
was  V01
$  <ARG2
8.95  
but  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
went  V02
on  
line  <ARG4
to  
check  V01
my  >ARG0
transaction  V01
it  >ARG0
show  V01
$  <ARG1
10.74  
.  

There  
is  V02
something  <ARG1
wrong  
or  
maybe  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
individual  >>ARG0
made  VLV
a  
mistake  V02
but  
to  
me  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
integrity  <ARG2
