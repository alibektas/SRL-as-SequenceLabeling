DPA  
:  
Iraqi  
authorities  >ARG0
announced*  
that  
they  >>ARG0
had*  
busted*  
up  
3  
terrorist  
cells  >ARG0
operating*  
in  
Baghdad  <ARGM-LOC

Two  >>ARG1

were*  
being*  
run*  
by  
2  
officials  <ARG0
of  
the  
Ministry  
of  
the  
Interior

The  
MoI  >>ARG1
in  
Iraq  
is*  
equivalent*  
to  
the  
US  
FBI  <ARG2

so  >ARGM-ADV
this  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
like  
having*  
J.  >ARG0

unwittingly  >ARGM-MNR

at  
a  
high  
level  <ARGM-ADV
members  <ARG1

the  
Weathermen  
bombers  
back  <ARGM-TMP

the  
1960s  <ARGM-TMP

The  
third  >>ARG1

being*  
run*  
by  
the  
head  <ARG0
of  
an  
investment  
firm

You  >ARG0
wonder*  
if  
he  >>ARG0

manipulating*  
the  
market  <ARG1

his  
bombing  
targets  <ARGM-MNR

Ghazaliyah

Although  
the

progress*

Al

Zaman  
:  
The  
Iraqi  
High  
Electoral  
Commission  >ARG0
on  
Friday  >ARGM-TMP
denied*  
a  
request*  
of  
the  
Debaathification  
Commission  <ARG0
to  
exclude*  
51  
individuals  <ARG1
from  
running*  
on  
party  
lists  <ARG1
in  
the  
Dec.  >ARGM-TMP
15  
elections*  
on  
grounds  <<ARGM-CAU
of  
having*  
been*  
sufficiently  >ARGM-EXT
involved*  
in  
Baath  
activities  <ARG2
to  
warrant*  
their  >>ARG1
being*  
excluded*  
from  
civil  
office  <ARG2
.  

The  
Commission  >ARG0
said*  
it  >ARG0
had*  
no  
legal  
grounds  <ARG1
for  
such  
an  
exclusion*  
.  

This  
item  >>ARG1
is*  
a  
small  
one  <ARG2
and  
easily  >ARGM-MNR
missed*  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
in  
my  >ARG0
view*  >>ARGM-ADV
it  >>ARG1
is*  
highly  >ARGM-EXT
significant*  
.  

The  
Debaathification  
Commission  >>ARG0
had*  
been*  
pushed*  
by  
Ahmad  <ARG0
Chalabi  
and  
his  
Iraqi  
National  
Congress  
very  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
had*  
pushed*  
many  
Sunni  
Arabs  <ARG1
into  
the  
arms  <ARG2
of  
the  
guerrillas  
.  

Chalabi  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
increasingly  >ARGM-MNR
marginalized*  
within  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
,  
however  <ARGM-DIS
,  
despite  
his  
ties  <ARGM-ADV
of  
clientelage  
with  
Washington  
and  
Tehran  
.  

He  >>ARG0
is*  
no  
longer  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
dominant  
Shiite  
list  <ARG2
,  
the  
United  
Iraqi  
Alliance  
,  
and  
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
many  
seats  <ARG1
in  
the  
new  
parliament  
.  

Some  
2,000  
junior  
officers  >>ARG1
of  
the  
old  
Baath  
army  
have*  
been*  
recalled*  
to  
duty  <ARGM-GOL
in  
recent  
months  <ARGM-TMP
,  
something  >>ARG1
Chalabi  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
blocked*  
if  
he  
could  
have*  
.  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
Electoral  
Commission  >>ARG0
is*  
refusing*  
to  
punish*  
people  <ARG1
for  
mere  
past  
Baath  
Party  
membership  <ARG2

The  
situation  >>ARG1

is*  
only  
going*  
to  
get*  
better*  
this

If  
someone  >ARG0
committed*  >ARGM-ADV
a  
crime  <ARG1
against  
humanity  
,  
prosecute*  
the  
person  <ARG1
.  

If  
he  
or  
she  
did*  >ARGM-ADV
not  
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
all  
the

as  
other  
Iraqis  <ARG1

In  
Baghdad  >>ARGM-LOC
the  
fighting*  >ARG1

in  
several  
areas  <ARGM-LOC

mostly  
in  
Sadr  
city  <ARGM-LOC

Baghdadis  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
venture*  
much  <ARGM-ADV
out  
of  
their  
neighbourhoods  <ARGM-DIR
any  
more  <ARGM-TMP
,  
you  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
where  >>ARG2
you  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
get*  
stuck*  
.  

There  
has*  
been*  
talk*  
that  
the  
night  
curfew  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
implemented*  
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

My  
neighbourhood  >>ARG2
has*  
been*  
surrounded*  
by  
American  
troops  <ARG1
for  
three  
days  <ARGM-TMP
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
helicopters  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
circling*  
over  
our  
heads  <ARGM-LOC
non-stop  <ARGM-TMP

Fedayeen  >>ARG1
are*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
visible*  
on  
the  
street  <ARGM-LOC
and  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
become*  
bolder*  
than  
ever  <ARGM-CXN
.  

Yesterday  >ARGM-TMP
there  
were*  
tens  >>ARG0
of  
them  
putting*  
road  >ARG1
blocks*  
on  
our  
street  <<ARG2
and  
setting*  
up  
mortars  <ARG1
,  
they  >ARG1
only  >ARGM-ADV
come*  
out  
in  
the  
open  <ARGM-LOC
when  >ARGM-TMP
Americans  >ARG0
leave*  
the  
area  <ARG1
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
start*  
firing*  
mortars  <ARG1
indiscriminately  <ARGM-MNR
and  
shooting*  
their  
AK  
-  
47's  <ARG2
in  
the  
air  <ARGM-DIR
.  

They  >>ARG0
are*  
setting*  
the  
road  >ARG1
blocks*  
at  
the  
exact  
same  
positions  >ARG2
they  >ARG1
were*  
during  
the  
war*  
last  
year  <ARGM-TMP
,  
which  >ARG0
indicates*  
they  >ARG1
are*  
the  
same  
people  <ARG2
.  

And  
there  
is*  
nothing  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
about  
it  <ARG2
really  <ARGM-ADV
,  
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0

suggesting*  
that  
we  >>ARG0

out  
and  
fight*  
them  <ARG1

living*  
in  
dream  
land  <ARGM-LOC

Even  
the  
IP  >>ARG0
and  
ICDC  
have*  
abandoned*  
the  
neighbourhood  <ARG1
,  
and  
those  >ARG1
are*  
trained  <ARG2
and  
armed  
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
expect*  
scared  
civilians  >>ARG0
to  
do*  
anything  <ARG1
except  
to  
hide*  
inside  <ARGM-LOC
and  
pray*  
a  
helicopter  >>ARG0
or  
a  
tank  
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
bomb*  
them  <ARG1
,  
and  
also  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
are*  
American  
soldiers  >>ARG0
going*  
to  
distinguish*  
the  
brave  
and  
valiant  
civilians  <ARG1
from  
the  
Fedayeen  <ARG2
?  

Everyone  >ARG1
is*  
apprehensive  <ARG2
,  
there  
is*  
some  
talk*  
that  
April  >>ARG1
9th  
and  
10th  
are*  
going*  
to  
be*  
bloody  
days  <ARG2

Most  
people  >>ARG0
have*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
gone*  
to  
work*  
the  
last  
few  
days  <<ARGM-TMP

although  
it  
seems*  
that  
the  
rest  >>ARG1
of  
Baghdad  
is*  
'  
normal*  
'  
(  
if  
you  >ARG0

what  >ARG2

)

There  
are*  
rumours  <ARG1

preparations*  
by  
slum

for  
another  
looting  >ARG1
spree*  
against  
banks  <ARGM-GOL

governmental

public  
property  
similar  <ARGM-ADJ
to  
the  
one  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
took*  
place  <ARG2
last  
April  <ARGM-TMP

and  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
overheard*  
youngsters  >>ARG0

my  
neighbourhood  
joking*  
about  
it  <ARG2

saying*  
things  <ARG1
like  
"  
This  
time  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
first  >ARG0

loot*  
,  
we  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
anything  <ARG1
the  
last  
time  <ARGM-TMP
"  
.  

Mosques  >>ARG0

calling*  
for  
donating*  
blood  <ARG1
,  
food  
,  
and  
medicine  
for  
Fallujah  <ARG2

and  
several  
convoys  >>ARG0
have*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
headed*  
out  <ARG1
for  
Fallujah  
,  
most  >ARG1
of  
them  
returned*  
later  <ARGM-TMP
though  <ARGM-ADV
.  

What  >ARG0
irritates*  >ARG1
me  <ARG1
is*  
this  
sudden  
false  
'  
solidarity  <ARG2
'  
between  
Sunni  
and  
Shi'ite  
clerics  
,  
we  >ARG0

the  
chance*  
,

what  >ARG1

?

the  <ARG1

:  

One  >ARG1
of  
the  
most

myths  
of  
recent  
times  
is*  
that  
the  
Chernobyl

1986

many  
thousands  >ARGM-EXT

CHERNOBYL  
ACCIDENT  
:  
TEN  
YEARS  
ON  

In  
the  
last  
decade  >>ARGM-TMP

there  
has*  
been*  
a  
real  >ARGM-ADJ

,  
to  
a

,  
adult

in  
contaminated  
regions  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
former  
Soviet  
Union  
(

which  >>R-ARG1

be*  
attributed*  
to  
the  
Chernobyl

until  
proven*  
otherwise  <ARG1
.  

The  
prestigious  
IAEA  >>ARG0
(  
International  
Atomic  
Energy  
Agency  
)  
published*  
an  
early  >ARGM-TMP
report*  >>ARG1

Chernobyl  <ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
was*  
based*  
on  
information  <ARG2

stated*  
that  
there  
was*  
no  >ARGM-NEG

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
in

which  >ARG0
contradict*  
the  
earlier  >ARGM-TMP
reports*  
.  

Here  >ARG2
are*  
some  
excerpts  <ARG1
:  

The  
dramatic  >ARG2
increase*  >>ARG1
in  
radiation  
-  
induced  
thyroid

in  
children  <ARGM-GOL

in  
Belarus  <ARGM-LOC
,  
Russia  
,  
and  
Ukraine  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
have*  
been*  
observed*  
since  
1991  <ARGM-TMP
,  
continues*  
to  
this  
day  <ARGM-TMP

...  
a  
drop*  
in  
the  
birth  
rate  <ARG1
,  
a  
deterioration*  
in  
women

reproductive  
health  <ARG1

an  
increase*  
in  
complications*  
during  
pregnancy  <ARGM-TMP
and  
birth*  
,  
and  
a  
deterioration*  
in  
neonatal  
health  <ARG1
....  

The  
dynamics  >>ARG1
of  
change*  
in  
the  
state  <ARG1
of  
health  
of  
children  >ARG1
affected*  
by  
the  
Chernobyl

in  
all  
three  
countries  
-  
Belarus  
,  
Russia  
,  
and  
Ukraine  
-  
in  
the  
post-accident  
period  
is*  
characterized*  
by  
persistent  
negative  
tendencies  <ARG0
:  
the  
morbidity  
rate  >>ARG1

going*  
up  <ARGM-DIR

the  
number  >>ARG1

really  
healthy  
children  
is*  
dropping*  
,  
and  
disability  >>ARG1
is*  
increasing*  
.  

As  
a  
parent  >ARGM-PRD
,  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
well  >ARGM-ADV
imagine*  
how  
painful  >ARG2
it  
must  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
for  
those  
families  >>ARG0
whose  
children  >>R-ARG0
are*  
succumbing*  
to

.  

There  
is*  
a  
lot  >ARGM-EXT
to  
learn*  
about  
Chernobyl  <ARG1

Being*  
well  
-  
informed  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
give*  
you  <ARG2
certainty  <ARG1

that  >>ARG1

There

As  
a

a  
lot  <ARG1

stopped*

stopped*  
the

The

several  >ARGM-ADJ

help*  
the  
children  <ARG2

One  >ARG1
of  
them  
is*  
the

to  
the

a  
few

I

an

;  
to  
see*  >ARG0
these  
little

breaks*  
the

The  
urge  >>ARG0

almost  
overwhelming  <ARG2

in  
which  >R-ARGM-LOC

would  >ARGM-MOD
virtually  >ARGM-ADV

whatever  <ARG1

On  
the

be*  
solved*

avoid*  
giving*  
al

put*  
away  <ARG2
their  
free

ways*

creating*  
jobs  <ARG1

pumping*  
money  <ARG2

better

Getting*  >ARG1
the  
Spanish  <ARG1

the  
Arab  
world

getting*  
the

out  <ARG1

The  
thing  >>ARG1
to  
keep*  
in

is*  
that  
Sunni  
Arab  
nationalists  >>ARG0

The  
problem  >>ARG1
with  
this

is*  
that

coup  >ARG1
-  
making*  
with  
"  
taking*  
office  <ARG1
,  
"  
and  
moreover  >ARGM-ADV
went*  
on  
to  
suggest*  
that  
the  
overthrow  >ARG0
of  
an  
elected  
prime  
minister  
and  
the  
installation  
in  
power  
of  
the  
Pakistan  
military  
,  
then  
the  
world  
's  
strongest  
supporter  
of  
the  
Taliban  
,  
would  >ARGM-MOD
bring*  
"  
stability  <ARG1
!  
"  

Musharraf  >ARG0
made*  
his  
coup  <ARG1
in  
part  <ARGM-ADV
because  
of  
the  
military  
's  
anger  <ARGM-CAU
over  
Prime  
Minister  
Nawaz  
Sharif  
's  
willingness  
to  
back*  
down  <ARGM-PRD
from  
confronting*  
India  <ARG1
over  
Kashmir  <ARGM-CAU
,  
so  
that  
he  >ARG1
explicitly  >ARGM-ADV
came*  
to  
power  <ARG2
as  
a  
warmonger  <ARGM-PRD
.  

I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tell*  
you  <ARG2
how  
ominous  
I  >ARG0
found*  
Bush  >ARG0
's  
performance*  
in  
that  
interview*  
.  

I  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
remember*  
him  >>ARG0
stuttering*  
about  
"  
the  
General  <ARG1
,  
"  
unable*  
to  
remember*  
Musharraf  
's  
name  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
obviously  >ARGM-ADV
had*  
no  
idea  <ARG1
what  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
was*  
talking*  
about  <C-ARG1
,  
though  
he  >ARG0
demonstrated*  
a  
number  <ARG1
of  
ill  
-  
fated  
instincts  
.  

He  >>ARG0
obviously  >ARGM-ADV
liked*  
authoritarian  >ARGM-ADJ
rule*  
better  <<ARGM-EXT
than  
democracy  
,  
equating*  
dictatorship  <ARG1
with  
"  
stability  <ARG2
.  
"  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
he  >>ARG0
needed*  
to  
know*  
anything  <ARG1
about  
South  
Asia  
,  
with  
its  
nuclear  
giants  
and  
radical  
religious  
politics  
--  
the  
latter  
a  
dire  
security  
threat  <ARG1
to  
the  
US  
.  

He  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tell*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
things  >>ARG1
were*  
becoming*  
more  >ARGM-EXT
unstable*  
as  <ARGM-ADV
opposed*  
to  
less  <ARG1
.  

Musharraf  >>ARG0
went*  
on  
to  
play*  
nuclear  
brinkmanship  <ARG1
with  
India  <ARG3
in  
2002  <ARGM-TMP
,  
risking*  
war*  
twice  <<ARGM-TMP
that  
year  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Although  
Musharraf  >>ARG0
did*  
turn*  >>ARGM-ADV
against  
the  
Taliban  <ARGM-DIR
after  
September  <ARGM-TMP
11  
,  
under  
extreme  
duress  <ARGM-CAU
from  
the  
US  
,  
elements  >>ARG1
of  
his  
military  
continued*  
to  
support*  
radical  
Islamism  <ARG1
and  
have*  
recently  >>ARGM-TMP
been*  
implicated*  
in  
assassination  >ARG1
attempts*  
on  
Musharraf  <ARGM-GOL
himself  
.  

This  >ARG1
was*  
the  
body  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
Bush  >ARG0
proclaimed*  
was*  
bringing*  
"  
stability  <ARG1
"  
to  
the  
region  <ARG2
in  
fall  <ARGM-TMP
of  
1999  
.  

So  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
one  
answer*  >>ARG1
to  
Bush  >ARG0
's  
charge*  
about  
Edwards  <ARG1
is*  
that  
if  
it  >ARG0
had*  >>ARGM-ADV
any  
merit  <ARG1
,  
Bush  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
declined*  
to  
run*  
himself  <ARGM-REC
.  

Another  
answer*  >ARG1
is*  
that  
Edwards  >ARG0
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
knows*  
far  
more  <ARG1
about  
foreign  
affairs  
now  <ARGM-TMP
than  
Bush  
did*  
then  
.  

Indeed  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
given  
how  >>ARGM-ADV
Bush  >>ARG0
has*  
rampaged*  >>ARGM-CAU
around  
the  
world  <ARG1
alienating*  
allies  <ARG1
and  
ignoring*  
vital  >ARGM-ADJ
conflicts*  
with  
the  
potential  <<ARGM-ADV
to  
blow*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
on  
the  
US  <ARGM-GOL
,  
one  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
well  >ARGM-ADV
argue*  
that  
Edwards  >ARG0
knows*  
more  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
than  
Bush  
does*  
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
what  >ARG1
Edwards  
'  
campaign  
literature  >ARG0
said*  
about  
his  
positions  <ARG3
:  
"  
Edwards  >ARG0
believes*  
that  
the  
U.S.  >>ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
an  
active  
leader  <ARG2
to  
help*  
resolve*  
conflicts*  
,  
from  
reducing*  
tensions*  
between  
India  <ARG1
and  
Pakistan  
to  
the  
peace  >ARG1
process*  
in  
Northern  
Ireland  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Edwards  >>ARG0
is*  
a  
strong  
supporter  <ARG2
of  
Israel  
,  
and  
believes*  
that  
the  
U.S.  >ARG0
has*  
a  
vital  
role  <ARG1
in  
promoting*  
peace*  
between  
the  
Israelis  <ARG1
and  
the  
Palestinians  
.  
"  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see*  
Bush  >ARG0
doing*  
any  <ARG1
of  
this  
.

Friday

2004  

As  
the  
American  
public  >ARG0
gradually  >ARGM-TMP
wearies*  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
Iraq  
crisis  <ARG1
,  
some  >>ARG0
have*  
begun*  
worrying*  
that  
the  
war*  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
blow*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
on  
the  
US  <ARGM-GOL
by  
creating*  
the  
conditions  <ARG1
for  
anti-American  
terrorism  
.  

Israel  >>ARG0
,  
however  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
is*  
much  >ARGM-EXT
closer*  
to  
Iraq  <ARG2
and  
is*  
likely*  
to  
suffer*  
from  
Iraqi  
instability  <ARG1
much  
more  <ARGM-EXT
acutely  
than  
will  
the  
United  
States  
.  

Ironically  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
among  
the  
strongest  
proponents  >>ARG2
of  
war*  
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
were*  
Israeli  
Prime  
Minister  <ARG1
Ariel  
Sharon  
and  
his  
neoconservative  
supporters  
in  
the  
US  
.  

Have*  
they  >ARG0
,  
however  >ARGM-DIS
,  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
weakened*  
Israeli  
security  <ARG1
?  

The  
biggest  
threat  >>ARG1
Israel  >ARG0
faces*  
is*  
not  
from  
conventional  
armies  <ARG2
but  
from  
the  
asymmetrical  
tactics  
of  
Palestinian  >>ARG0
national  >ARG1
liberation*  >ARG1
movements*  
.  

The  
derailing*  >>ARG0
of  
the  
Oslo  >ARG0
peace  >ARG1
process*  
by  
the  
hard  
-  
line  
policies  <<ARG0
of  
Sharon  
and  
the  
Palestinian  
intifada  
has*  
encouraged*  
suicide  >ARGM-MNR
bombings*  
.  

This  >>ARG0
,  
in  
turn  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
has*  
discouraged*  
international  >ARG0
investment*  
in  
Israel  <ARG2
and  
has*  
made*  
it  <ARG1
less  >ARGM-EXT
likely*  
that  
immigrants  >ARG1
to  
the  
country  
will  >ARGM-MOD
actually  >ARGM-ADV
remain*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Although  
Israel  >ARG0
withdrew*  >>ARGM-ADV
from  
Lebanese  
territory  <ARG2
in  
May  <ARGM-TMP
2000  
,  
the  
radical  
Lebanese  
Shiite  
party  >>ARG1
,  
Hizbullah  
,  
has*  
not  >>ARGM-NEG
been*  
mollified*  
.  

It  >>ARG0
is*  
estimated*  
to  
have*  
some  
5,000  
armed  
fighters  <ARG1
,  
and  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
pursued*  
attacks*  
against  
Israeli  
forces  <ARG1
to  
compel*  
them  >ARG1
to  
withdraw*  
from  
the  
Shebaa  
Farms  <ARG2
,  
a  
sliver  >ARG1
of  
Syrian  
territory  
that  >R-ARG1
Israel  >ARG0
annexed*  
after  
the  
1967  >ARGM-TMP
war*  
.  

Any  
thorough  >ARGM-EXT
assessment*  >>ARG0
of  
the  
impact*  
of  
the  
Iraq  >ARG1
war*  
and  
its  
aftermath  
on  
Israel  
's  
security  
environment  
must  >ARGM-MOD
,  
therefore  >ARGM-ADV
,  
closely  >ARGM-ADV
examine*  
its  >ARG0
likely  >ARGM-ADJ
effect*  
on  
the  
conduct*  
of  
asymmetrical  
warfare  <ARG1
.  

Although  
it  
is*  
often  >ARGM-TMP
alleged*  >>ARGM-ADV
(  
without  
much  
evidence  <ARGM-MNR
)  
that  
Saddam  >>ARG0
Hussein  
gave*  
money  <ARG1
to  
the  
families  <ARG2
of  
Palestinian  
suicide  
bombers  
and  
so  >ARGM-ADV
encouraged*  
asymmetrical  
warfare  <ARG1
,  
it  
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
clear*  
that  
he  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
posed*  
a  
danger  <ARG1
to  
Israel  
.  

The  
Palestinians  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG0
have*  
been*  
willing*  
to  
kill*  
themselves  <ARG1
to  
end*  
the  
Israeli  >ARG0
occupation*  
of  
the  
Gaza  
Strip  <ARG1
and  
the  
West  
Bank  
were*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
driven*  
by  
economic  >ARG1
considerations*  
.  

Saddam  >>ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
did*  
anything  <ARG1
practical  
to  
help*  
the  
Palestinians  <ARG2
.  

At  
some  
points  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
as  
in  
the  
late  
1980s  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
he  >>ARG1
reportedly  >>ARGM-ADV
made*  >ARGM-LVB
behind  
-  
the  
-  
scenes  >ARGM-LOC
overtures*  
to  
the  
Israelis  <ARG2
to  
arrive*  
at  
some  
sort  <ARG4
of  
a  
deal*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
allow*  
Palestinian  
radicals  >ARG0
to  
launch*  
operations*  
against  
Israel  <ARGM-GOL
from  
Iraq  <<ARGM-DIR
.  

By  
the  
late  
1990s  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
Iraq  >>ARG0
had*  
no  
nuclear  
or  
biological  
weapons  
program  <ARG1
,  
and  
had*  
destroyed*  
its  
chemical  
weapons  
stockpiles  <ARG1
.  

Its  
ramshackle  
army  >>ARG1
had*  
virtually  >ARGM-ADV
collapsed*  
before  
the  
American  >ARG0
invasion*  
in  
2003  <ARGM-TMP
.  

If  
it  
is*  
hard*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
see*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
Baathist  
Iraq  >ARG0
posed*  
any  
real  
threat  <ARG1
to  
Israel  
,  
it  
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
so  >ARGM-EXT
difficult*  
to  
see*  
a  
menace  <ARG1
in  
the  
current  
instability  <ARGM-ADV
.  

The  
bungling*  >>ARG0
of  
post-war  
Iraq  <ARG1
by  
the  
Bush  >ARG0
administration*  
created*  
a  
weak  
and  
failed  
state  <ARG1
.  

Armed  
militias  >>ARG0
,  
many  >ARG1
staffed*  
by  
former  
Iraqi  
military  
men  <ARG2
with  
substantial  >>ARGM-EXT
training*  
and  
experience*  
,  
have*  
proliferated*  
.  

The  
US  >>ARG0
chose*  
to  
ally*  
itself  <ARG1
with  
such  
groups  <ARG2
as  
the  
Supreme  
Council  >>ARG2
for  
the  
Islamic  
Revolution  
in  
Iraq  
,  
whose  
15,000  
-  
strong  
Badr  
Corps  
paramilitary  >>R-ARG2
was*  
trained*  
by  
the  
Iranian  
Revolutionary  
Guards  <ARG0
.  

Anti-Israeli  >ARG1
and  
pro-Palestinian  
feeling*  >>ARG1
is*  
strong*  
among  
several  
major  
Iraqi  
ideological  
groups  <ARGM-ADV
and  
currents  
.  

The  
more  
radical  
Shiites  >>ARG0
,  
who  >R-ARG0
generally  >ARGM-ADV
follow*  
the  
theocratic  
notions  <ARG1
of  
Iran  
's  
Ayatollah  
Ruhollah  
Khomeini  
,  
routinely  >>ARGM-TMP
chant*  
and  
demonstrate*  
against  
Israel  <ARGM-GOL
.  

They  >ARG0
vehemently  >ARGM-EXT
protested*  
the  
Israeli  >ARG0
assassination*  
of  
Sheikh  
Ahmed  <ARG1
Yassin  
,  
the  
leader  
of  
Hamas  
,  
last  
March  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Worse*  >>ARGM-ADV
for  
Israel  <ARG2
,  
the  
assassination*  >ARG0
drew*  
a  
denunciation*  
even  
from  
the  
moderate  
and  
cautious  
Grand  >ARG0
Ayatollah  
Ali  
Sistani  
,  
who  >R-ARG0
wields*  
enormous  
moral  
authority  <ARG1
over  
Iraqi  
Shiites  
.  

These  
Shiite  >ARG0
movements*  >>ARG0
had*  
been*  
suppressed*  
by  
Saddam  
Hussein  
's  
regime  <ARG0
,  
but  
have*  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
organized*  
and  
armed*  
themselves  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
have*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
reestablished*  
their  
historical  
links  <ARG1
with  
Lebanese  
and  
Iranian  
Shiites  
.  

It  
is*  
inevitable*  
that  
most  
Iraqi  
Shiites  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
side*  
with  
their  
Hizbullah  
coreligionists  <ARG1
against  
Israel  <ARGM-GOL
,  
and  
it  >>ARG1
seems*  
likely*  
that  
Iraqi  
Shiites  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
get*  
rich*  
enough  <ARGM-CXN
from  
Iraqi  >ARG0
petroleum  >ARG1
sales*  
in  
the  
future  <<ARGM-TMP
that  
they  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
in  
a  
good  
position  >ARGM-LOC
to  
bankroll*  
Lebanese  
Shiite  
radicals  <ARG1
.  

Sunni  
Arab  
fundamentalists  >ARG0
deeply  >ARGM-MNR
sympathize*  
with  
the  
Palestinians  <ARG1
and  
with  
Hamas  
,  
and  
those  >ARG0
in  
Iraq  
have*  
deep*  
historical  
inks  <ARG1
with  
fundamentalists  
in  
Jordan  
and  
Palestine  
.  

Iraqi  
cities  >>ARG1
such  
as  
Fallujah  
and  
Ramadi  
were*  
on  
the  
truck  
route  <ARG2
from  
Amman  
to  
Baghdad  
,  
and  
so  >ARGM-ADV
came*  
under  
the  
influence*  
of  
the  
Salafi  >ARG0
movement*  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
popular*  
in  
Jordan  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Secular  
Arab  
nationalist  
groups  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
universally  >ARGM-ADV
sympathize*  
with  
the  
Palestinians  <ARG1
,  
and  
those  >ARG1
in  
post-Saddam  
Iraq  
are*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
exception*  
.  

Whereas  
Saddam  
Hussein  
's  
dictatorship  >ARG0
ensured*  >>ARGM-ADV
that  
such  
populist  
currents  >>ARG1
were*  
kept*  
firmly  
under  
control*  
,  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
free*  
to  
organize*  
.  

An  
Iraq  >>ARG1
in  
which  >R-ARGM-LOC
armed  
fundamentalist  
and  
nationalist  
militias  >ARG0
proliferate*  
is*  
inevitably  <ARGM-ADV
a  
security  
worry  <ARG2
for  
Israel  
.  

If  
even  
a  
modicum  >>ARG1
of  
normality  
and  
security  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
returned*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
Iraq  <ARG2
,  
its  
citizens  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
benefit*  
from  
the  
country  
's  
petroleum  
reserves  <ARG0
.  

That  
private  
wealth  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
easily  >>ARGM-MNR
be*  
funneled*  
into  
aid*  
for  
the  
Palestinians  <ARG2
and  
for  
Lebanese  
Shiites  
.  

Israel  >ARG1
's  
security  >ARG2
interests*  >>ARG1
are*  
best  >ARGM-ADV
served*  
by  
peace*  >>ARG1
with  
its  
neighbors  <ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
only  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
achieved*  
by  
trading*  
land  <ARG1

into  
any  
military  >ARG1

in  
the  
island  
nation  >ARG0
's  
two  
decades  
-  
old  >ARGM-TMP
civil  >ARGM-ADJ
war*  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
has*  
seen*  
violent  
strife  <ARG1
between  
ethnic  
Tamils  
and  
the  
Sinhalese  
majority  
-  
leaving*  
over  
60,000  <ARG1
dead  <ARG1
on  
both  
sides*  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
that  >ARG0
explains*  
the  
delay*  
in  
the  
signing  <ARG1
of  
a  
formal  >ARGM-ADJ
defense  >ARG1
agreement*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1

Kumaratunga  
's  
four  
-  
day  >ARGM-TMP

According  
to  
Professor  >>ARGM-ADV
S  
D  
Muni  
,  
South  
Asia  
expert  
at  
the  
Jawaharal  
Nehru  
University  
,  
the  
two  
-  
year  >ARGM-TMP

talks*  >>ARG1
between  
Colombo  <ARG0
and  
the  
Liberation  
Tigers  
of  
Tamil

(  
LTTE  
)  
are*  
stalemated*  
.  

For  
that  
reason  >>ARGM-CAU
,  >ARG1-DSP
he  >ARG0
said*  
,  <C-ARG1-DSP
Kumaratunga  
's  
government  >>ARG0
was*  
keen*  
to  
beef*  
up  
military  
preparedness  <ARG1
with  
Indian  >ARG0
support*  
.  

"  
The  
Sri  
Lankan  
government  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
initiate*  
a  
conflict*  
but  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
interested*  
in  
deterring*  
the  
LTTE  <ARG1
from  
starting*  
one  <ARG1
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
Tigers  >ARG0
look*  >>ARG1
as  
if  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
on  
the  
brink  <ARG2
of  
launching*  
another  
offensive  <ARG1
,  
"  
Muni  >ARG0
told*  
IPS  <ARG2
.  

Colombo  >ARG0
held*  
six  
rounds*  
of  
talks*  
with  
the  
Tigers  <ARG2
between  
September  <<ARGM-TMP
2002  
and  
March  
2003  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
last  
April  >ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
rebels  >>ARG0
abruptly  >ARGM-MNR
pulled*  
out  
of  
negotiations*  
demanding*  
recognition*  
,  
first  <ARGM-TMP
,  
for  
the  
right*  
to  
self  >ARG1
-  
rule*  
before  
proceeding*  
any  
further  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Kumaratunga  >ARG0
's  
India  >ARG1
tour*  >ARG1
preceded*  
a  
three

day  >ARGM-TMP
visit*  
to  
Sri

by  
Norwegian  
Foreign  
Minister  <ARG0

Petersen  
in  
a  
new  >ARGM-ADJ

to  
revive*  
the  
peace  >ARG1

that  >>R-ARG1

ceasefire*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
Oslo  >ARG0
successfully  >ARGM-ADV
brokered*  
in  
February  <ARGM-TMP

.  

Petersen  >>ARG0
held*  >>ARG1
discussions*  
with  
both  
Kumaratunga  <ARG2
and  
the  
reclusive  
LTTE  
leader  
Velupillai

in  
the  
rebel  
stronghold  <ARGM-LOC

at  
the

Saturday  <<ARGM-TMP

the

on

Colombo  >>ARG1
,  
too  >ARGM-DIS
,  
seems*  
to  
be*  
in  
an  
intractable  
position  <ARG2
.  

According  
to  
former  
Indian  
army  
general  
A  
S  
Kalkat  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
difficulty  >ARG1
for  
Kumaratunga  
's  
government  
lay*  
in  
the  
fact  <ARG2
that  
the  
LTTE  >>ARG0
had*  
become*  
a  
de  
jure  
power  <ARG2
in  
the  
north  
and  
east  
of  
the  
island  
and  
was*  
running*  
every  
aspect  <ARG1
of  
civil  >ARG1
administration*  
in  
the  
areas  <ARGM-LOC
within  
its  >ARG0
control*  
.  

A  
veteran  >>ARGM-ADV

in  
the

the  
1987  
Indo  
-  
Sri

Peace  
Accord  >ARG0

which  >R-ARG0
ambitiously  >ARGM-MNR
provided*  
for  
the  
disarming*  
of  
the  
formidable  
LTTE  <ARG1
-  
Kalkat  >ARG0
said*  
the  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
defense  >ARG2
deal*  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
essentially  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
a  
reiteration*  
of  
the  
older  
one  <ARG1
minus  
its  >ARG1
military  >ARG2
commitment*  
.  

Kalkat  >>ARG0
,  
who  >R-ARG0
currently  >ARGM-TMP
chairs*  
the  
independent  
US  >ARGM-LOC
-  
based*  
International  
Council  <ARG1
on  
Conflict  
Resolution  
,  
said*  
despite  
the  
failure  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
Indian  
army  
to  
disarm*  
or  
even  >ARGM-ADV
subdue*  
the  
Tigers  <ARG1
,  
India  >ARG1
remained*  
the  
only  
power  <ARG3
capable  
of  
influencing*  
the  
course  <ARG1
of  
the  
current  >ARGM-TMP
peace  >ARG1
talks*  
.  

"  
The  
Norwegians  >ARG0
mean*  >>ARG1
well  <ARG1
but  
their  
role  >>ARG1
is*  
limited*  
to  
that  <ARG2
of  
honest  
broker  
and  
the  
LTTE  >>ARG0
is*  
keenly  >ARGM-EXT
aware*  
that  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
the  
power  <ARG1
[  
unlike  
India  <ARGM-ADV
]  
to  
underwrite*  
any  
arrangement*  
,  
"  
Kalkat  >ARG0
told*  
IPS  <ARG2
in  
an  
interview*  
.  

In  
1987  >ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
Tamil  
Tigers  >ARG0
reluctantly  >ARGM-MNR
accepted*  
the  
peace  
accord  <ARG1
under  
Indian  
pressure  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Under  
the  
accord  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
a  
new  
northeastern  
provincial  
council  >>ARG1
was*  
formed*  
and  
the  
Indian  
army  >>ARG1
was*  
deployed*  
as  
peacekeepers  <ARGM-PRD
in  
the  
north  <ARG2
and  
east  
.  

However  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
differences*  >>ARG0
between  
India  <ARG1
and  
LTTE  
soon  >>ARGM-TMP
surfaced*  
and  
led*  
to  
clashes*  
between  
Tiger  
guerrillas  <ARG0
and  
the  
Indian  
peace  >ARG1
keeping*  
force  
.  

About  
1,200  
Indian  
soldiers  >>ARG1
were*  
killed*  
during  
this  
phase  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
conflict*  
.  

India  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
pull*  
back  <ARG2
its  
forces  <ARG1
from  
Sri  
Lanka  <ARGM-DIR
in  
1989  <ARGM-TMP
following

persuade*  
the  
LTTE  >ARG1

back  <ARG4

He  >ARG0

about  
the

"  
and  
reaching*  
an

has*  
to  
be*  
negotiated*  
by

parties  <ARG0

without  
the  
constraints  <<ARGM-MNR

While

U.S.  
secretaries  >>ARG0
of  
state  
--  
save  
perhaps  
Dean  
Rusk  
--

they  >ARG0

little  >ARG1

with  <C-ARG1
,  
few  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
as  
brazen  <ARG2
as  
Colin  
Powell  
.  

Two  
years  
ago  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
Pakistani  
President  >>ARG1
Pervez  
Musharraf  
was*  
surprised*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
leader  >>ARG0
of  
the  
main  
Islamist  
alliance  
--  
Maulana  
Fazlur  
Rahman  
--  
visited*  
India  <ARG1
and  
issued*  
a  
series  <ARG1
of  
highly  
conciliatory  >ARGM-ADJ
statements*  
.  

As  
Pakistan  
's  
president  >>ARG0
had*  
been*  
telling*  >>ARGM-CAU
the  
United  
States  <ARG2
he  >>ARG1
was*  
"  
forced*  
"  
into  
taking*  
a  
hawkish  
line  <ARG1
on  
India  <ARGM-CAU
precisely  
by  
the  
likes  <<ARGM-ADV
of  
Rahman  
,  
this  >ARG1
was*  
an  
embarrassment  <ARG2
.  

The  
reality  >ARG1
is*  
that  
India  >ARG1
is*  
no  
longer  <ARGM-TMP
the  
enemy  >ARG1
of  
choice*  
for  
the  
people  <ARG0
of  
Pakistan  
.  

That  
distinction*  >>ARG1
has*  
now  >ARGM-TMP

to  
the

such  
as  
Strobe  
Talbott  
,  
who  >>R-ARG0

long  >ARGM-TMP
sought*  
to  
divest*  
India  <ARG2
of  
its  
defensive  
capability  <ARG1
against  
another  
nuclear  
power  
in  
Asia  
,  
understand*  
the  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
feasible  >ARGM-ADJ
solution*  >ARG1
for  
Kashmir  <ARG1
is*  
the  
acceptance*  
of  
the  
status  
quo  <ARG1
.  

India  >ARG0
keeps*  
what  >ARG1
it  >ARG0
has*  
while  
Pakistan  >>ARG0
and  
China  >>ARG2
(  
which  >>R-ARG2
was*  
gifted*  
a  
slice  <ARG1
of  
the  
territory  
three  
decades  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
)  
do*  
likewise  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Simultaneously  >ARGM-TMP
,  
New  
Delhi  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
ensure*  
a  
degree  >>ARG0
of  
autonomy  
for  
the  
state  
that  >>R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD

end*  
of  
his  
term  <ARG1

office  
yet  
,  
under

to  
have*  
an

,  
the  
pendulum  >>ARG1
of  
U.S.  
policy  
has*  
once  
again  >ARGM-TMP
swung*  
toward  
a  
quixotic  >ARGM-MNR

to  
prize*  
at  <ARG1

the  
Valley  <ARG1

Kashmir

"

that  >R-ARG1

what  >>ARG1

This  
writer  >>ARG0
has*  
for  
years  >ARGM-TMP
regarded*  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
solution*  
to  
the  
Kashmir  
problem  <ARG1
as  
being*  
the  
trifurcation*  
of  
the  
Indian  
part  <ARG1
of  
the  
state  
into  
a  
Hindu  
-  
majority  
Jammu  <ARG2
,  
a  
Buddhist  
-  
dominated  
Ladakh  
and  
the  
overwhelmingly  
Muslim  
Kashmir  
Valley  
,  
with  
the  
third  
state  >ARG2
given*  
little  <ARG1
of  
taxpayers  
'  
money  
but  
substantial  
autonomy  
.  

With  
luck  >>ARGM-MNR
,  
the  
Kashmir  
Valley  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
attract*  
investment*  
from  
the  
Middle  
East  <ARG0
and  
other  
locations  >>ARGM-LOC
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
Muslims  >>ARG0
are*  
dominant*  
and  
become*  
a  
tourist  
,  
education*  
and  
services*  
haven  <<ARG2
within  
India  
.  

The  
overwhelming  
majority  >>ARG1
of  
Muslims  
in  
Kashmir  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
happy*  
with  
such  
an  
outcome  <ARG0
,  
except  
for  
the  
tiny  
jihadi  
segment  >>ARGM-CAU
patronized*  
by  
the  
U.S.  
State  
Department  <ARG0
and  
the  
Pakistan  
Army  
,  
which  >>R-ARGM-CAU
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
even*  
the  
score*  
with  
India  <<ARGM-COM
for  
their  >ARG1
catastrophic  >ARGM-ADJ
defeat*  
in  
Bangladesh  <ARGM-LOC
in  
1971  <ARGM-TMP

with

"

,  
in  
most  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
them  
,  
the

that  >>R-ARG0

a  
valley  >ARG1

loose  <ARG2
from  
Indian  >ARG0

and  
under  
its

That

Indian  
nationalism  <ARG1

has*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
struck*  
the  
conferees  >>ARG2

among  
whom  >>R-ARG2

been*  
several

sake  <ARG2
of  
a  
free  >ARGM-ADJ

to

Vienna  
.  

Despite  
many  
wrinkles  >ARGM-ADV
,  
India  >ARG1
remains*  
a  
part  
-  
democracy  <ARG3
and  
merely  >ARGM-ADV
signing*  >>ARG0

a  
piece  >ARG0

paper

calls*  
for  
an

you  <ARG1

writing*

op  
-  
ed  
piece  <ARG1
against  
Sonia  
Gandhi  
or  
Atal  
Behari  
Vajpayee  
would  
instantly  
.  

It  
was*  
the  
business  
community  >ARG1
in  
India  
that  >R-ARG1
stepped*  
in  
after  
Vajpayee  >ARG0
indulged*  
in  
an  
empty  
bout  <ARG1
of  
saber  >ARG1
rattling*  
in  
2002  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
pointing*  
out  
that  
the  
only  
beneficiary  >>ARG1
of  
the  
mythical  >ARGM-ADJ
perception*  
that  
war*  >>ARG1
--  
especially  >ARGM-ADJ

war*  
--  
was*  
around  <ARG2
the  
corner  
in  
the  
subcontinent  <ARGM-LOC
was*  
China  <ARG2
.  

The  
reason  >ARG1
for  
this  
is*  
that  
India  >>ARG0
is*  
emerging*  
as  
an  
alternative  
investment  
destination  <ARG1
to  
China  
,  
hence  
the  
favor  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
the  
generals  >ARG0
in  
Islamabad  
do*  
to  
their  
trusty  
supplier  <ARG2
of  
nukes  
and  
missiles  
by  
creating*  
a  
scare*  
about  
war*  >ARG2
involving*  
India  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
in  
fact  >ARGM-ADV
the  
real  
flashpoints  >ARG1
are*  
the  
Taiwan  
Straits  <ARG2
and  
North  
Korea  
.  

Since  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
India  >>ARG0
has*  
talked*  
peace*  
while  
always  >ARGM-TMP
signaling*  
that  
only  
the  
status  
quo  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
acceptable*  
as  
a  
final  >ARGM-TMP
settlement*  
:  
a  
line  >>ARG1

that  >>R-ARG1

followed*  
in  
the  
case*  
of  
disputes*  
with  
China  <ARG1
as  <<ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

Unfortunately  >>ARGM-ADV
for  
those  >ARG0
eager  
to  
indefinitely  >ARGM-TMP
carry*  
on  
with  
the  
lucrative  
business  <ARG1
of  
conflict  >ARG1
resolution*  
in  
South  
Asia  <ARGM-LOC

Pervez  >>ARG0

has*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
called*  
Colin

's  
bluff  <ARG1

challenging*  
him  >ARG0
to

on  
his  >ARG0
frequent  >ARGM-TMP
statements*  >ARG0
implying*  
that  
the  
Indians  >ARG0
jump*  
to  
his  
commands  <ARG1

Once  
the  
Manmohan  
Singh  
government  >ARG0
shows*  >>ARGM-TMP
that  
it  >ARG0
has*  
little  
appetite  <ARG1

suicide  
,  
Musharraf  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
face*  
the  
moment  <ARG1
of  
truth  
:  
accept*  
the  
inevitable  <ARG1

or  
once  
again  >ARGM-TMP
ramp*  
up  
the  
insurgency  <ARG1
and  
spawn*  
a  
fresh  
lot  <ARG1
of  
killers  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
hit*  
not  
merely  
Mumbai  <ARG1
and  
New  
Delhi  
but  
London  
and  
Chicago  
as  
well

The  
one

shown*  
that  
it  >ARG0

the  
realities  <ARG1

During

the  
Guard  
,  
George  >ARG0
Bush  
flew*  
the

The

As  
far  >>ARGM-ADV
as  
George  >ARG0
Bush  
knew*  
,  
he  >>ARG1
and  
his  
unit  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
transferred*  
to  
Vietnam  <ARG2

In  
all  
this  
so  
-  
called  
controversy  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
has*  
anyone  >ARG0
considered*  
that  
perhaps  >ARGM-ADV
George  >>ARG0
Bush  
just  >ARGM-ADV
wanted*  
to  
fly*  
jets  <ARG1
?  

And  >ARGM-DIS
,  
let*  
's  >ARG0
remember*  
,  
flying*  >>ARG0
supersonic  
fighter  
jets  <ARG1
is*  
dangerous*  
!  

They  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
let*  
just  
anybody  >ARG0
do*  
it  <ARG1

Some  
reporters  >>ARG0

you  >ARG0

the

have*  
actually  >ARGM-ADV

the  
truth  <ARG1

George  >ARG0

's

in  
the  
Texas

For  
example  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
did*  
you  >ARG0

that

more

here  >ARG2

the

What  >>ARG1

you  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV

about  
George  
W.  
Bush  
’s  
time  <ARG2
in  
the  
Air  
National

?  

That  
he  >>ARG1
did*  
n’t  >ARGM-NEG
show*  
up  
for  
duty  <ARGM-PRP
in  
Alabama  <ARGM-LOC

That  
he  >ARG0

That

News  >ARGM-ADJ
coverage*  >>ARG0
of  
the  
president  
’s  
years  <ARG1
in  
the  
Guard  
has*  
tended*  
to  
focus*  
on  
one  
brief  
portion  <ARG2
of  
that  
time  
—  
to  
the  
exclusion*  
of  
virtually  
everything  <ARG1
else  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
just  
for  
the  
record  >ARGM-PRP
,  
here  >ARG2
,  
in  
full  >ARGM-ADV
,  
is*  
what  >ARG1
Bush  >ARG0
did*  
:  

The  
future  
president  >ARG0
joined*  
the  
Guard  <ARG1
in  
May  <ARGM-TMP
1968  
.  

Almost  
immediately  >ARGM-TMP
,  
he  >ARG0
began*  
an  
extended  
period  <ARG1
of  
training*  
.  

Six  
weeks  
of  
basic  >ARGM-ADJ
training*  
.  

Fifty  
-  
three  
weeks  
of  
flight  >ARG1
training*  
.  

Twenty  
-  
one  
weeks  
of  
fighter  
-  
interceptor  >ARG1
training*  
.  

That  >ARG1
was*  
80  
weeks  >ARG2
to  
begin*  
with  <C-ARG2
,  
and  
there  
were*  
other  
training  
periods  >ARG1
thrown*  
in  
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
full  
-  
time  >ARGM-TMP
work*  
.  

By  
the  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
was*  
over  <ARG2
,  
Bush  >>ARG0
had*  
served*  
nearly  
two  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Not  
two  
years  
of  
weekends  
.  

Two  
years  
.  

After  
training*  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Bush  >>ARG0
kept*  
flying*  
,  
racking*  
up  
hundreds  <ARG1
of  
hours  
in  
F  
-  
102  
jets  
.  

As  
he  
did*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >ARG0
accumulated*  
points  <ARG1
toward  
his  >>ARG2
National  
Guard  >ARG1
service*  >ARG0
requirements*  
.  

At  
the  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
guardsmen  >>ARG0
were*  
required*  
to  
accumulate*  
a  
minimum  <ARG1
of  
50  
points  
to  
meet*  
their  >ARG1
yearly  >ARGM-TMP
obligation*  
.  

According  
to  
records  >>ARGM-ADV
released*  
earlier  <ARGM-TMP
this  
year  <ARGM-TMP
,  
Bush  >ARG0
earned*  
253  
points  <ARG1
in  
his  
first  
year  <ARGM-TMP
,  
May  <ARGM-TMP
1968  
to  
May  
1969  
(  
since  
he  >ARG0
joined*  >>ARGM-CAU
in  
May  <ARGM-TMP
1968  
,  
his  >ARG0
service*  >>ARG1
thereafter  >>ARGM-TMP
was*  
measured*  
on  
a  
May  
-  
to  
-  
May  
basis  <ARGM-MNR
)  
.  

Bush  >ARG0
earned*  
340  
points  <ARG1
in  
1969  <ARGM-TMP
-  
1970  
.  

[  
In  
other  
words  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Bush  >ARG0
earned*  
enough  
points  <ARG1
to  
satisfy*  
the  
requirements*  
for  
his  
entire  
six  
year  
hitch  <ARG0
in  
1969  <<ARGM-TMP
-  
1970  
alone  
.  

-  
acd  
]  

He  >ARG0
earned*  
137  
points  <ARG1
in  
1970  <ARGM-TMP
-  
1971  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
he  >ARG0
earned*  
112  
points  <ARG1
in  
1971  <ARGM-TMP
-  
1972  
.  

The  
numbers  >ARG0
indicate*  
that  
in  
his  
first  
four  
years  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Bush  >ARG1
not  
only  >ARGM-ADV
showed*  
up  
,  
he  >ARG1
showed*  
up  
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Did*  
you  >ARG0
know*  
that  <ARG1
?  

That  >ARG0
brings*  
the  
story  <ARG1
to  
May  >>ARGM-TMP
1972  
—  
the  
time  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
has*  
been*  
the  
focus  <ARG2
of  
so  
many  >ARGM-ADJ
news  >ARG1
reports*  
—  
when  >>R-ARGM-TMP
Bush  >>ARG1
“  
deserted*  
”  
(  
according  
to  
anti-Bush  
filmmaker  
Michael  <ARGM-ADV
Moore  
)  
or  
went*  
“  
AWOL  <ARG2
”  
(  
according  
to  
Terry  <ARGM-ADV
McAuliffe  
,  
chairman  
of  
the  
Democratic  
National  
Committee  
)  
.  

Bush  >ARG0
asked*  
for  
permission*  
to  
go*  
to  
Alabama  <ARG4
to  
work*  
on  
a  
Senate  >ARG1
campaign*  
.  

His  
superior  
officers  >ARG0
said*  
OK  <ARG1
.  

Requests*  >>ARG1
like  
that  <ARGM-ADJ
were*  
n’t  >ARGM-NEG
unusual*  >ARG1
,  
says*  
retired  
Col.  >ARG0
William  
Campenni  
,  
who  >R-ARG0
flew*  
with  
Bush  <ARGM-COM
in  
1970  <ARGM-TMP
and  
1971  
.  

“  
In  
1972  >ARGM-TMP
,  
there  
was*  >ARG1
an  
enormous  
glut  <ARG1
of  
pilots  
,  
”  
Campenni  >ARG0
says*  
.  

“  
The  
Vietnam  
War  >>ARG1
was*  
winding*  
down  
,  
and  
the  
Air  
Force  >>ARG0
was*  
putting*  
pilots  <ARG1
in  
desk  
jobs  <ARG2
.  

In  
’72  
or  
’73  
,  
if  
you  >ARG1
were*  
a  
pilot  <ARG2
,  
active  
or  
Guard  
,  
and  
you  >>ARG1
had*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
obligation*  
and  
wanted*  
to  
get*  
out  <ARG2
,  
no  
problem  
.  

In  
fact  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >>ARG0
were*  
helping*  
them  >ARG0
solve*  
their  
problem  <ARG1
.  
”  

So  >ARGM-DIS
Bush  >>ARG0
stopped*  
flying*  
.  

From  
May  >ARGM-TMP
1972  
to  
May  
1973  
,  
he  >ARG0
earned*  
just  
56  
points  <ARG1
—  
not  
much  
,  
but  
enough  
to  
meet*  
his  >ARG2
requirement*  
.  

Then  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
in  
1973  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
as  
Bush  >>ARG0
made*  >>ARGM-ADV
plans*  
to  
leave*  
the  
Guard  <ARG1
and  
go*  
to  
Harvard  
Business  
School  <ARG4
,  
he  >>ARG1
again  >ARGM-TMP
started*  
showing*  
up  
frequently  <ARGM-TMP
.  

In  
June  >ARGM-TMP
and  
July  
of  
1973  
,  
he  >ARG0
accumulated*  
56  
points  <ARG1
,  
enough  
to  
meet*  
the  
minimum  >ARGM-ADJ
requirement*  
for  
the  
1973  
-  
1974  
year  <ARG0
.  

Then  
,  
at  
his  >ARG0
request*  
,  
he  
was*  
given*  >ARGM-LVB
permission*  
to  
go*  
.  

Bush  >>ARG0
received*  
an  
honorable  >ARGM-MNR
discharge*  
after  
serving*  
five  
years  <ARGM-TMP
,  
four  
months  
and  
five  
days  
of  
his  >ARG0
original  >ARGM-ADJ
six  
-  
year  >ARGM-TMP
commitment*  
.  

By  
that  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
however  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >>ARG0
had*  
accumulated*  
enough  
points  <ARG1
in  
each  
year  <ARGM-TMP
to  
cover*  
six  
years  <ARG1
of  
service*  
.  

During  
his  >ARG0
service*  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Bush  >ARG0
received*  
high  >ARGM-ADJ
marks*  
as  
a  
pilot  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

A  
1970  >ARGM-TMP
evaluation*  >ARG0
said*  
Bush  >>ARG1
“  
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
stands*  
out  
as  
a  
top  
notch  
fighter  
interceptor  
pilot  <ARGM-PRD
”  
and  
was*  
“  
a  
natural  
leader  >ARG1
whom  >R-ARG1
his  
contemporaries  >ARG0
look*  
to  <C-ARG1
for  
leadership*  
.  
”  

A  
1971  >ARGM-TMP
evaluation*  >ARG0
called*  
Bush  <ARG1
“  
an  
exceptionally  
fine  
young  
officer  >>ARG0
and  
pilot  
”  
who  >>R-ARG0
“  
continually  >ARGM-TMP
flies*  
intercept  >ARG1
missions*  
with  
the  
unit  <<ARGM-COM
to  
increase*  
his  
proficiency  <ARG1
even  
further  <ARG2
.  
”  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
a  
1972  >ARGM-TMP
evaluation*  >ARG0
called*  
Bush  <ARG1
“  
an  
exceptional  
fighter  
interceptor  
pilot  <ARG2
and  
officer  
.  
”  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
it  
is*  
only  >ARGM-ADV
natural*  
that  
news  >ARG1
reports*  >>ARG1
questioning*  
Bush  >ARG0
’s  
service*  
—  
in  
The  
Boston  
Globe  <<ARGM-LOC
and  
The  
New  
York  
Times  
,  
on  
CBS  
and  
in  
other  
outlets  
—  
would  >ARGM-MOD
come*  
out  
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Democrats  >>ARG1
are*  
spitting  >ARGM-EXT
mad*  
over  
attacks*  
on  
John  
Kerry  
’s  
record  <ARG1
by  
the  
group  <ARG0
Swift  
Boat  
Veterans  
for  
Truth  
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
as  
it  >ARG1
is*  >ARGM-PRD
with  
Kerry  <ARGM-MNR
,  
it  
’s*  
reasonable*  
to  
look*  
at  
a  
candidate  
’s  
entire  
record  <ARG1
,  
including  
his  >>ARG0
military  >ARG1
service*  
—  
or  
lack*  
of  
it  <ARG1
.  

Voters  >>ARG0
are*  
perfectly  >ARGM-ADV
able*  
to  
decide*  
whether  
it  >>ARG1
’s*  
important*  
or  
not  
in  
November  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
Kerry  >ARG0
camp  
blames*  
Bush  <ARG1
for  
the  
Swift  
boat  
veterans  >ARG1
’  
attack*  
,  
but  
anyone  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
has*  
spent*  
much  
time  <ARG1
talking*  
to  
the  
Swifties  <ARG2
gets*  
the  
sense*  
that  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
doing*  
it  <ARG1
entirely  
for  
their  
own  
reasons  <ARGM-PRP
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
it  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
noted*  
in  
passing*  
that  
Kerry  >>ARG0
has*  
personally  >ARGM-MNR
questioned*  
Bush  >ARG0
’s  
service*  
,  
while  
Bush  >>ARG0
has*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
personally  >ARGM-MNR
questioned*  
Kerry  <ARG1
’s  
.  

In  
April  >>ARGM-TMP
—  
before  
the  
Swift  
boat  
veterans  >>ARG0
had*  
said*  >ARGM-TMP
a  
word  <ARG1
—  
Kerry  >ARG0
said*  
Bush  >>ARG0
“  
has*  
yet  <ARG1
to  
explain*  
to  
America  <ARG2
whether  <ARG1
or  
not  
,  
and  
tell*  
the  
truth  <ARG1
,  
about  
whether  
he  >ARG1
showed*  
up  
for  
duty  <ARGM-PRP
.  
”  

Earlier  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Kerry  >ARG0
said*  
,  
“  
Just  
because  
you  >ARG0
get*  >>ARGM-ADV
an  
honorable  >ARGM-MNR
discharge*  
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
,  
in  
fact  >ARGM-ADV
,  
answer*  
that  
question*  
.  
”  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
after  
the  
Swift  
boat  
episode  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
spotlight*  >>ARG1
has*  
returned*  
to  
Bush  <ARG2
.  

That  >>ARG1
’s*  
fine*  
.  

We  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
know*  
as  
much  <ARG1
as  
we  
can  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
perhaps  >ARGM-ADV
someday  >ARGM-TMP
Kerry  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
release*  
more  <ARG1
of  
his  
military  
records  
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
.

His

in  
The

each

One  
week  
to  
elections  
day  
and  
the  
general  
atmosphere  >>ARG2
in  
the

is*  
eerie  <ARG2

yet  
strikingly  >ARGM-EXT
familiar*  
.  

I  >ARG0
suspect*  
the

There  
is*  
no  >ARGM-NEG

that

the

30  
January  
as  
a  
day  <ARG2
of  
renewed  >ARGM-ADV
hope*  
,  
one  >>ARG2
they  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
awaiting*  
all  
their  
lives  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
at  
the  
same  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
many  
others  >>ARG0
are*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
dreading*  
it  <ARG1
.  

The  
interim  
government  >>ARG0
has*  
promised*  
security  >ARG1
measures*  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
reduce*  
the  
violence  <ARG1
on  
the  
day  <ARGM-TMP
of  
elections*  
,  
but  
I  >>ARG0
fail*  
to  
see*  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
they  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
protect*  
all  
5,000  
(  
or  
so  
)  
balloting  
centres  <ARG1
.  

Many  
voting  
centres  >>ARG1
have*  
already  >>ARGM-TMP
been*  
successfully  >>ARGM-ADV
attacked*  
or  
destroyed*  
in  
many  
areas  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Now  >>ARGM-ADV
that  
the  
picture  >>ARG1
is*  
clear*  
,  
the  
two  
main  
competing  
lists  >>ARG1
seem*  
to  
be*  
the  
United  
Iraqi  
Coalition  
list  <ARG2
and  
Allawi  
's  
Al  
-  
Iraqiya  
list  
.  

Ayad  >>ARG0
Allawi  
,  
and  
other  
ministers  >ARG0
running*  
on  
his  
list  <ARGM-LOC
,  
have*  
quite  
expectedly  >ARGM-ADV
used*  
their  
governmental  
positions  <ARG1
in  
campaigning*  
.  

One  
minister  >ARG0
reportedly  >ARGM-ADV
handed*  
out  
100  
dollar  
'  
gifts  <ARG1
'  
to  
journalists  >ARG0
attending*  
a  
press  >ARG0
conference*  
for  
Allawi  <ARG1
,  
a  
practice  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
brings*  
back  <ARG3
bad  
memories  <ARG1
to  
many  
Iraqis  <ARG2
.  

Sheikh  
Naji  >ARG0
Al  
-  
Abbudi  
,  
a  
spokesman  
for  
Sistani  
,  
affirmed*  
the  
claims*  
that  
the  
Grand  
Ayatollah  >>ARG0
is*  
backing*  
the  
United  
Iraqi  
Coalition  
list  <ARG1
.  

Indeed  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
Sistani  
's  
agents  >>ARG0
all  
over  
the  
country  
have*  
been*  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
active*  
in  
educating*  
Iraqi  
Shia  <ARG1
on  
the  
merits  <ARG2
of  
elections*  
,  
which  >>ARG0
has*  
led*  
to  
the  
assassination*  
of  
at  
least  
two  <ARG1
of  
them  
.  

Al  >ARG0
-  
Abbudi  
stated*  
that  
"  
His  
Emminence  >>ARG0
"  
decided*  
to  
openly  >ARGM-MNR
support*  
the  
list  <ARG1
because  
"  
others  >>ARG0
"  
(  
obviously  
a  
reference*  
to  
Allawi  <ARG1
)  
have*  
been*  
abusing*  
official  
state  
positions  <ARG1
and  
media  
outlets  
in  
their  >ARG0
campaigning*  
.  

Again  >ARGM-DIS
there  
is*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
official  >ARGM-ADJ
written  >ARGM-PRD
statement*  >>ARG1
from  
Sistani  
's  
office  <ARG0
confirming*  
this  
allegation*  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
think*  
is*  
intentional*  
.  

Ahmed  >>ARG0
Al  
-  
Chalabi  
and  
defense  
minister  
Hazim  
Al  
-  
Sha'lan  
have*  
been*  
engaging*  
in  
shrill  >ARGM-ADJ
public  >ARG1
attacks*  
over  
the  
media  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

Chalabi  >ARG0
describing*  
Sha'lan  <ARG1
as  
a  
"  
Ba'athist  <ARG2
"  
and  
a  
"  
former  
double  
agent  
for  
Saddam  
and  
the  
CIA  
"  
,  
while  
Sha'lan  >ARG0
dismisses*  
Chalabi  <ARG1
as  
a  
"  
thief  <ARG2
"  
and  
an  
"  
Iranian  
stooge  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
longs*  
for  
his  >ARG1
own  >ARGM-ADJ
origins*  
by  
defending*  
Iran  <ARG1
"  
.  

One  
remark*  >>ARG0
made*  
by  
Sha'lan  
on  
Al  
-  
Arabiya  
TV  
,  
that  
he  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
say*  
more  <ARG1
about  
Chalabi  
because  
he  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
embarrass*  
himself  <ARG1
and  
the  
viewers  
almost  >>ARGM-ADV
made*  
me  >ARG1
roll*  
on  
the  
floor  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
an  
extremely  
amusing  
episode  <ARG2
,  
watching*  
Chalabi  >>ARG1
looking*  
smug  <ARG1
and  
amused  
,  
contrasted*  
with  
Sha'lan  >ARG0
,  
all  
serious  
and  
barely  >ARGM-EXT
keeping*  
himself  <ARG1
from  
swearing*  
.  

Fistfights  
,  
please  
.  

Hazim  >>ARG0
Al  
-  
Sha'lan  
,  
by  
the  
way*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
is*  
the  
son  <ARG2
of  
the  
late  
Sheikh  
of  
Al  
-  
Khaza'il  
in  
Diwaniya  
and  
has*  
the  
potential  <ARG1
to  
replace*  
former  
information  
minister  
,  
M.S.  <ARG1
Al  
-  
Sahaf  
,  
in  
his  >ARG0
nonsensical  >ARGM-ADJ
media  >ARGM-ADJ
statements*  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
passed*  
as  
jokes*  
.  

The  
main  
Kurdish  
coalition  
list  >>ARG1
(  
PUK  
and  
KDP  
)  
is*  
barely  >ARGM-EXT
mentioned*  
outside  
the  
Kurdish  
region  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Even  
there  >>ARGM-LOC
,  
many  
Kurds  >>ARG0
look*  
and  
act*  
as  
if  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
going*  
to  
grab*  
the  
chance*  >ARGM-ADV
to  
vote*  
them  <ARG1
out  
of  
power  <ARGM-PRD
.  

I  >ARG0
doubt*  
that  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
outcome  <ARG2
though  <<ARGM-DIS
.  

Many  
Iraqis  >>ARG0
,  
including  
conservative  
and  
religious  
Iraqis  
,  
are*  
surprisingly  >ARGM-ADV
rooting*  
for  
the  
Iraqi  
Communist  
party  <ARG1
,  
probably  
in  
an  
attempt*  
to  
counter*  
the  
influence*  
of  
Islamists  <ARG0
in  
the  
forthcoming  
National  
Assembly  <ARG1
.  

The  
Communist  
party  >>ARG1
has*  
the  
largest  
number  <ARG1
of  
registered  
party  
members  
in  
the  
country  
and  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
considered*  
as  
the  
oldest  
popular  
political  
party  <ARGM-PRD
in  
Iraq  
.  

Its  
support  
base  >>ARG1
is*  
much  >ARGM-CXN
larger*  
than  
what  
it  
seems*  
.  

***  

Several  
candidates  >>ARG1
were*  
assassinated*  
and  
targeted*  
these  
last  
two  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
,  
others  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
forced*  
under  
threats  <ARGM-MNR
to  
withdraw*  
and  
to  
follow*  
the  
example  <ARG1
of  
the  
Islamic  
party  
.  

Sectarian  >ARG1
tensions*  >ARG1
are*  
at  
their  
highest  <ARG2
since  
April  <ARGM-TMP
,  
2004  
,  
with  
Sunni  
insurgents  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
openly  >ARGM-MNR
attacking*  
Husseiniyas  <ARG1
and  
Shia  
mosques  
.  

I  >>ARG0
had*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
interesting  >ARGM-ADJ
conversation*  
with  
a  
middle  
-  
aged  
taxi  
driver  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG1
used*  
to  
live*  
in  
Fallujah  <ARGM-LOC
and  
is*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
at  
relatives  <ARG2
in  
Amiriya  <ARGM-LOC
,  
Baghdad  
.  

After  
asking*  >>ARGM-TMP
me  <ARG2
which  
tribe  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
belong*  
to  <C-ARG1
(  
thus  >ARGM-ADV
assessing*  
my  
sectarian  
background  <ARG1
)  
he  >>ARG0
started*  
hurling*  
abuses*  
at  
the  
Shia  <<ARG2
,  
calling*  
them  <ARG1
Persians  <ARG2
,  
Majoos  
(  
fire  
worshippers  
)  
,  
rabid  
dogs  
and  
a  
handful  
of  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
descriptions*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
mention*  
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

He  >ARG0
described*  
Allawi  
's  
face  <ARG1
as  
that  <ARG2
of  
a  
f*ed  
horse  
and  
he  >ARG0
dismissed*  
the  
whole  
government  <ARG1
as  
a  
band  <ARG2
of  
thieves  
and  
traitors  
.  

I  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
argue*  
with  
him  <ARG1
but  
I  >ARG0
asked*  
him  <ARG2
what  >>ARG1
he  >ARG0
believed*  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
viable  >ARGM-ADJ
solution*  
to  
this  
mess  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
said*  
that  
resistance*  >ARG1
was*  
the  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
commonsense  >ARGM-ADJ
solution*  
.  

First  >ARGM-TMP
driving*  
out  <ARG2
the  
Americans  <ARG1
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
fighting*  
the  
Shia  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-GOL
into  
submission*  
(  
as  
in  
1991  <<ARGM-MNR
)  
.  

Sunni  
Iraqis  >ARG0
contend*  
that  
elections*  >>ARG0
are*  
impossible*  
to  
hold*  
under  
occupation*  
.  

Leaving*  >>ARGM-ADV
aside  <ARG2
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
this  
views*  >ARG0
conflicts*  
with  
other  
historical  
examples  <ARG1
in  
the  
region  
,  
Sunnis  >>ARG0
have*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
offered*  
an  
alternative  >ARGM-ADJ
choice*  
,  
which  >ARG0
eventually  >ARGM-TMP
leads*  
one  >ARG0
to  
guess*  
that  
the  
opinion  >>ARG1
held*  
by  
the  
Fallujan  
taxi  
driver  <ARG0
above  
is*  
precisely  
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
are*  
planning*  
to  
implement*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
had*  >ARGM-LVB
another  
conversation*  
some  
months  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
with  
a  
retired  
Ba'athist  
old  
-  
timer  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
claimed*  
that  
Ba'athists  >ARG0
have*  
the  
means  >>ARGM-MNR
to  
stage*  
a  
third  
coup  
d'etat  <ARG1
and  
return*  
to  
power  <ARG4
within  
10  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
of  
an  
American  >ARG1
withdrawal*  
.  

On  
sensing*  >>ARGM-TMP
my  
incredulity  <ARG1
to  
his  >ARG0
statement*  
he  >ARG0
asserted*  
that  
Ba'athist  
cells  >ARG1
exist*  
in  
all  
parts  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
country  
and  
that  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
have*  
a  
central  
command  <ARG1
,  
even  
though  
many  >>ARG0
have*  
formed*  
seperate  
cells  <ARG1
(  
often  
under  
Islamic  
labels  
)  
with  
their  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-ADJ
leaderships*  
.  

He  >ARG0
said*  
that  
they  >ARG0
have*  
the  
training*  
and  
the  
funding*  
as  
well  
as  
the  
support*  
of  
neighbouring*  
and  
regional  
governments  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
concur*  
that  
Ba'athists  >>ARG1
and  
former  
security  
forces  
are*  
capable*  
of  
immediately  >ARGM-TMP
controlling*  
at  
least  
5  <ARG1
out  
of  
18  
governorates  
,  
along  
with  
the  
capital  
,  
if  
Americans  >>ARG1
are*  
to  
be*  
removed*  
from  
the  
picture  <ARG2
entirely  <ARGM-EXT
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
see*  
that  <ARG1
as  
a  
fatal  >ARGM-ADJ
misconception*  >>ARG0
,  
which  >>R-ARG0
is*  
doing*  >ARGM-LVB
Sunnis  >ARG1
harm*  
,  
because  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
believe*  
the  
US  >>ARG0
is*  
going*  
anywhere  <ARG4
so  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Any  
government  >>ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
assumes*  
power  <ARG1
after  
the  
elections*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
realises*  
this  <ARG1
,  
so  
not  
even  
Sistani  >>ARG0
is*  
going*  
to  
call*  
the  
US  >ARG0
to  
withdraw*  
its  
troops  <ARG1
,  
despite  
what  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
is*  
saying*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
not  
until  
they  >>ARG2
are*  
ensured*  
the  
insurgency  >ARG1
is*  
out  
of  
the  
picture  <ARG2
,  
or  
that  
they  >ARG0
have*  
an  
alternative  
foreign  
power  >>ARG0
(  
in  
this  
case*  
Iran  
)  
to  
back*  
them  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

The  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
hope*  >ARG1
now  >ARGM-TMP
is*  
that  
,  
following  
the  
elections*  >ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
National  
Assembly  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
offer*  
the  
hand  <ARG1
of  
peace*  
and  
reconciliation*  
to  
the  
dissenting  
parties  <<ARG3
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
suggest*  
going*  
for  
tribal  
Sheikhs  <ARG1
rather  
than  
clerics  
,  
since  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
the  
upper  
hand  <ARG1
in  
their  
areas  <ARGM-LOC
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
effectively  >ARGM-ADV
root*  
out  
any  
Ba'athists  <ARG1
in  
their  
midst  
in  
return*  
for  
a  
promise*  
of  
sharing*  
power  <ARG1
and  
authority  
.  

Many  >>ARG1
of  
these  
Sheikhs  
have*  
been*  
disenfranchised*  
and  
abused*  
over  
the  
last  
two  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Very  
recently  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
US  
forces  >>ARG0
in  
Al  
-  
Anbar  
made*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
terrible  >ARGM-ADJ
blunder*  
by  
accidentally  >ARGM-MNR
killing*  
Abdul  <ARG1
-  
Razaq  
Inad  
Al  
-  
Gu'ud  
,  
Sheikh  
of  
the  
Al  
-  
Bu  
Nimr  
clan  
from  
the  
powerful  
Dulaym  
tribe  
.  

Al  >>ARG1
-  
Gu'ud  
had*  
favoured  
elections*  
and  
was*  
in  
good  
terms  <ARG2
with  
the  
government  
.  

The  
Gu'ud  
family  >>ARG3
even  >ARGM-ADV
accepted*  
to  
be*  
offered*  
the  
seat  <ARG1
of  
Al  
-  
Anbar  
governor  
some  
months  
back  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
Al  
-  
Bu  
Nimr  >ARG1
in  
Ramadi  
and  
Al  
-  
Qaim  
rose*  
in  
arms  <ARGM-MNR
against  
Saddam  <ARGM-GOL
in  
the  
mid-nineties  <ARGM-TMP
following  
the  
execution*  
of  
Thamir  <ARG1
Madhlum  
Al  
-  
Dulaymi  
,  
an  
Air  
Force  
general  >ARG0
belonging*  
to  
their  
tribe  <ARG1
.  

The  
revolt  >>ARG1
took*  
two  
weeks  <ARG1
to  
be*  
suppressed*  
by  
the  
Republican  
Guard  <ARG0
.  

Another  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
step*  >ARG1
was*  
the  
recent  >ARGM-TMP
arrest*  
of  
Sheikh  
Hassan  <ARG1
Al  
-  
Lihabi  
,  
of  
the  
Lihaib  
tribe  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
scattered*  
between  
the  
governorates  <ARG2
of  
Al  
-  
Anbar  
,  
Mosul  
and  
Salah  
Al  
-  
Din  
.  

Al  >>ARG1
-  
Lihaibi  
was*  
running*  
in  
elections*  
and  
is*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
said*  
to  
have*  
withdrawn*  
following  
this  
incident  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0

be*  
the  
only  
path  <ARG2

to  
a

The  
Shia  >ARG0

not  >ARGM-NEG
live*  
without  
the  
Sunnis  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
vice

.  

Both  >>ARG0

shared*  
this

the  
last  
14  
centuries  <ARGM-TMP
and  
there  
is*  
no

that  >R-ARGM-MNR
one  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
live*  
without  
the  
other  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Even  >ARG2

not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
possibility  <ARG2

there  
are*  
no

Remember*  
Luis  <ARG1
Posada  
Carriles  
?  

Here  >ARG2
's*  
a  
Miami  
Herald  >ARG0
interview*  >ARG1
with  
the  
relaxed  
terrorist  <ARG1
and  
former  
CIA  
operative  
in  
a  
luxury  
condo  <ARGM-LOC
,  
published*  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

(  
"  
At  
first  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
hid*  
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT
.  

I  >ARG0
thought*  
the  
US  
government  >>ARG0
was*  
looking*  
for  
me  <ARG1
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
hide*  
a  
lot  
less  <ARGM-EXT
.  
"  
)  

Because  
of  
such  >ARGM-EXT
talk*  
,  
Posada  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
taken*  
into  
custody  <ARG3
by  
Immigration  
officials  <ARG0
.  

I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
imagine*  
they  >>ARG0
wanted*  
to  
do*  
this  <ARG1
.  

Authorities  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
likely  >>ARGM-ADV
have*  
been*  
happy*  
answering*  
questions*  
about  
Posada  
's  
whereabouts  <ARG1
with  
an  
indefinite  
shrug  <<ARG2
.  

As  
recently  >ARGM-TMP
as  
last  
week  
the  
official  
line  >ARG0
stated*  
they  >ARG0
had*  
no  
knowledge  <ARG1
he  >>ARG0
had*  
entered*  
the  
country  <ARG1
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
comfortable  >>ARGM-ADV
among  
the  
thugs  
,  
Posada  >>ARG0
overplayed*  
his  
hand  <ARG1
and  
embarrassed*  
his  
old  
patron  <ARG1
,  
the  
US  
government  
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
though  
he  >>ARG1
'd*  
been*  
a  
faithful  
servant  >ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >ARG1
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
such  
a  
player  <ARG2
that  
he  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
away  
with  
that  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
taken*  
a  
cue  <ARG1
from  
another  
bomber  >>ARG1
some  
pesky  
dark  
-  
skinned  
foreigners  >ARG0
want*  
extradited*  
,  
CIA  
operative  
Michael  
Meiring  
.  

Posada  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
told*  
any  
inquisitive  
journalist  <ARG2
at  
his  
doorstep  
something  <ARG1
like  
Meiring  >ARG0
told*  
the  
single  
American  
reporter  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
bothered*  
following*  
his  
bloody  
trail  <ARG1
from  
the  
Philippines  <ARGM-DIR
,  
that  
"  
If  
this  >ARG0
harms*  
me  <ARG1
in  
any  
way*  
,  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
find*  
my  
power  <ARG1
then  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
you  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
find*  
out  
who  >ARG2
I  >ARG1
am*  
.  
"  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
then  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
maybe  >>ARGM-ADV
that  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
have*  
saved*  
him  <ARG1
either  <ARGM-DIS
,  
because  
Posada  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
Meiring  <ARG2
.  

Posada  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
given*  
up  
,  
but  
Meiring  
ca  
n't  
.  

Meiring  
's  
crimes  >>ARG0
are*  
fresh*  
,  
and

false  
flag  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
is*

"  

They  >ARG1
happened*  
in  
the  
Philippines  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
,  
like  
Pakistan  >ARGM-MNR
,  
is*  
an  
important  
and  
vulnerable  
node  <ARG2
for  
the  
business  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
intelligence  
agencies  >ARG0
and  
terrorist  
organizations  
conduct*  
with  
each  
other  <ARGM-COM
.  

(  
Ask*  
Terry  <ARG2
Nichols  
about  
the  
Philippines  <ARG1
.  
)  

The  
bombings*  >>ARG0
implicated*  
Muslims  <ARG1
,  
and  
exacerbated*  
regional  >ARG1
tensions*  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
the  
Bush  >>ARG0

and  
its  
friends  >ARG0
wearing*  
the  
brass  <ARG1
in  
the  
Philippine  
military  <ARGM-LOC
sought*  
to  
exploit*  
.  

Posada  
's  
crimes  >ARG1
,  
on  
the  
other  
hand  >ARGM-DIS
,  
must  >ARGM-MOD
seem*  
like  
ancient  
history  <C-ARG1
,  
especially  
to  
a  
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
their  
history  <ARG1
.  

And  
to  
those  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
know*  
their  
crimes  <ARG1
,  
not  
even  
that  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
will  >>ARGM-MOD
Posada  >>ARG1
be*  
given*  
up  
?  

I  >ARG0
doubt*  
he  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
extradited*  
to  
Venezuela  <ARG3
,  
which  >ARG1
is*  
the  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  >>ARGM-MNR
that  
question*  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
answered*  
with  
a  
Yes  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
expect*  
it  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
determined*  
that  
,  
under  
"  
Strong  
Man  
"  
Hugo  >>ARGM-ADV
Chavez  
,  
Posada  >>ARG2
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
guaranteed*  
a  
fair  >ARGM-MNR
trial*  
.  

The  
hope*  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
that  
Posada  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
soon  >>ARGM-TMP
be*  
offered*  
to  
a  
post-Chavez  
Allawi  
-  
like  
puppet  <ARG3
in  
Caracas  
.  

Whether  
such  
an  
offer*  >>ARG1
were*  
accepted*  
or  
declined*  
would  
make*  >ARGM-LVB
no  
difference*  
;  
justice  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
served*  
then  <ARGM-TMP
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
Posada  >>ARG1
's*  
nearly  
80  
years  >ARG2
old*  
,  
and  
the  
Venezuelan  
people  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
ensure*  
that  >ARG1
's*  
a  
vain  >ARGM-ADJ
hope*  
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
instead  >>ARGM-DIS
Posada  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
held*  
indefinitely  <ARGM-TMP
,  
in  
comfortable  
custody  <ARG3
.  

An  
embarrassment  
to  
the  
US  
still  
,  
just  
not  
as  
embarrassing  
as  
having*  
the  
old  
killer  >>ARG0
strut*  
about  
Miami  <ARG2
,  
gloating*  
in  
his  
freedom  <ARG1
.  

Meiring  >ARG1
is*  
more  <ARG2
than  
an  
embarrassment  
.  

His  >ARG2
case*  >ARG0
threatens*  
the  
consensus  
fiction  <ARG2
of  
the  
"  
War*  
on  
Terror  <ARG2
.  
"  

So  >ARGM-DIS
his  
name  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
remain*  
unspoken  <ARG3
.

Due  
to  
the  
Judge  >>ARG0
in  
the  
1983  >ARGM-TMP

him  <ARG1

by

the

all

Wilson  >>ARG0

working*  
for  
the  
CIA  <ARG2

the

to

In

India  >ARG0
charged*  
34  
Arakan  
separatists  >ARG0
from

in

part  
of  
the  
Andaman

group  
(  
see*  
end  
note  <ARG1

.  

These

members  >>ARG1

Army  
,  
the  
military  
wing  
of  
the

just  
the  
tip  <ARG2

thick*  
with

unofficial  
figures  >>ARG1

meeting*  
,  
’’  
the  
diplomat  >ARG0
said*  
.  

An  
Afghan  
official  >>ARG0
at  
the  
meeting*  
added*  
,  
‘’  
The  
Americans  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
realise*  
that  
the  
Taliban  >ARG1

a  
bigger  
threat  <ARG2
to  
our  
security  
than  
Al  
Qaeda  
.  
’’  

Karzai  >>ARG1
was*  
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
pleased*  
at  
the  
results  <ARG0
.  

‘’  
President  >>ARG0
Musharraf  
promised*  >>ARG1
to  
help*  
us  <ARG2

cooperate*  
with  
us  <ARG1
on  
curbing*  
terrorist  
activity  <ARG1
by  
the  
Taliban  
,  
’’  
says*  
Karzai  <ARG0
.  

The  
next  
day  >ARGM-TMP
an  
angry  
Musharraf  >ARG0
categorically  >ARGM-ADV
said*  
that  
Pakistan  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
send*  
Pakistani  
troops  <ARG1
to  
Iraq  <ARG2
,  
a  
clear  
snub  
to  
the  
Americans  
.  

Until  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
had*  
said*  
Pakistan  
’s  
options  >>ARG1
were*  
open*  
.  

However  >ARGM-ADV
Pakistani  
officials  >ARG0
insist*  
that  
the  
decision*  >ARG1
was*  
unconnected  <ARG2
to  
the  
tripartite  >ARGM-ADJ
meeting*  
.  

US  
and  
NATO  
military  
officers  >ARG0
in  
Kabul  
say*  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
too  >ARGM-CXN
early*  
to  
say*  
whether  
Bush  
’s  
tough  
message  >>ARG0
was*  
instrumental*  
in  
persuading*  
Musharraf  >ARG0
and  
the  
ISI  
to  
pressure*  
the  
Taliban  >ARG1
to  
restrain*  
from  
disrupting*  
the  
elections*  
.  

However  >ARGM-ADV
there  
were*  
visible  >ARGM-ADJ
signs*  
of  
a  
crackdown  <ARG1
on  
the  
Pakistan  >ARG1
side*  
.  

‘’  
Pakistan  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
has*  >>ARG1
a  
large  
force  >>ARG1
deployed*  
in  
Baluchistan  <ARG2
which  >R-ARG1
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
there  <ARG2
before  <ARGM-TMP

’’  
says*  
Lt.  
General  
David  <ARG0
Barno  
.  

‘’  
There

cooperation*  
between  
our  
forces  <ARG0

both  
sides  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
border  
,  
but  
the  
movement*  >ARG1
of  
Taliban  <ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
goes*  
on  
both  
ways*  
,  
’’  
he  >ARG0
adds*  
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
several  
days  
before  
the  
elections*  >ARGM-TMP
Pakistan  >ARG0
closed*  
the  
border  >ARG1
crossing*  
point  >ARG1
at  
Chaman  
in  
Baluchistan  
which  >R-ARG1
is*  
a  
key  
entry  
point  <ARG2
for  
the  
Taliban  
into  
Afghanistan  
.  

However  >ARGM-ADV
US  
military  
officers  >ARG0
say*  
regular  
army  
officers  >>ARG1
-  
many  
of  
them  
Pashtun

units  >ARG1
of  
the  
Frontier  
Corps  
who  >R-ARG1

on  
the

deeply  <ARG3
sympathetic  <ARG3
to  
the  
Taliban  
and  
the  
mullahs  
of  
the  
JUI  
.  

At  
the  
same  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
US  >>ARG0
remains*  
oblivious*  
of  
the  
serious  
problems  >>ARG1
and  
political  >ARGM-ADJ
fallout*  
which  >>R-ARG1
the  
army  >>ARG0
is*  
facing*  
in  
its  >ARG0
operations*  
in  
Waziristan  <ARGM-LOC

Not  
only  
is*  
the  
army  >ARG0
facing*  
serious  >ARGM-ADJ
political  >ARGM-ADJ
fallout*  
,  
growing  
anti-Americanism  
and  
anti-army  >ARG1
feeling*  
in  
the  
tribal  
areas  <<ARGM-LOC
but  
it  >>ARG0
is*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
taking*  
heavy  
casualties  <ARG1
-  
between  
400  
-  
500  
Pakistani  
soldiers  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
killed*  
in  
the  
region  <ARGM-LOC
since  
March  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Musharraf  >>ARG0
has*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
maintained*  
that  
the  
US  >>ARG0
has*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
provided*  
actionable  
intelligence  <ARG1
about  
Taliban  
leaders  >ARG0
hiding*  
in  
Baluchistan  <ARGM-LOC
.  

That  >ARG1
too  >ARGM-ADV
may  >ARGM-MOD
change*  
.  

US  
and  
Afghan  
intelligence  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
shortly  >>ARGM-TMP
be*  
presenting*  
the  
ISI  <ARG2
with  
a  
list  <ARG1
of  
Taliban  
extremists  
and  
their  
suspected  
whereabouts  
.  

Moreover  >ARGM-ADV
there  
are*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
major  >ARGM-ADJ
covert  >ARGM-MNR
attempts*  
under  
way*  
to  
try*  
and  
bring*  
back  <ARG2
to  
Kabul  
leading  
Taliban  
commanders  >>ARG0
,  
who  >>R-ARG0
have*  
been*  
living*  
quietly  <ARGM-MNR
in  
Pakistan  <ARGM-LOC
and  
have*  
taken*  
no  
part  <ARG1
in  
the  
Taliban  
insurgency  <ARGM-LOC
.  

With  
the  
Taliban  
failure  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
disrupt*  
the  
Afghan  >ARG0
elections*  
,  
the  
militants  >ARG1
are*  
even  
more  
isolated  <ARG2
from  
the  
mainstream  
Taliban  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG1
want*  
to  
return*  
home  <ARG4
.  

Until  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
Pakistan  >>ARG0
has*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
facilitated*  
such  
a  
return*  
and  
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
happen*  
until  
there  
is*  
both  
a  
pull*  
from  
Kabul  <ARG0

a  
push*  
from  
Islamabad  <ARG0

With

win*  
the  
elections*  
and  
the  
demotion*  
of  
key  
former  
Northern  
Alliance  
figures  <ARG1
such  
as  
General  
Fahim  
and  
warlord  
Ismail  
Khan  
,  
there  
is*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
little  
reason  <ARG1
for  
moderate  
Taliban  
leaders  >ARG0
to  
fear*  
reprisals  <ARG1
from  
former  
Northern  
Alliance  
figures  
if  
they  >ARG1
return*  
home  <ARG4
.  

Their  >ARG1
removal*  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-ADV
provide*  
increased  >ARGM-PRD
motivation*  
for  
Pakistan  >ARG0
to  
help*  
the  
return*  
of  
moderate  
Taliban  <ARG1
.  

Afghan  
officials  >ARG0
welcomed*  
the  
appointment*  
on  
October  <ARGM-TMP
3  
of  
Lt.  
General  
Ashfaq  <ARG1
Kiyani  
as  
the  
new  
ISI  
chief  <ARG2
.  

Kayani  >>ARG1
is*  
well  >>ARGM-EXT
known*  
and  
liked*  
in  
Kabul  <ARGM-LOC
as  
during  
the  
last  
year  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
led*  
the  
Pakistani  
delegation  <ARG1
in  
the  
tripartite  >ARGM-ADJ
military  >ARG0
meetings*  
with  
the  
Afghan  
and  
US  
military  <ARG1
on  
issues*  
related  <ARGM-ADJ
to  
border  >ARG0
issues*  
.  

Karzai  >>ARG0
also  
has*  
to  
deal*  
with  
the  
stepped  
up  
rivalry  <ARG2
between  
India  
and  
Pakistan  
in  
Afghanistan  
.  

Islamabad  >ARG0
accuses*  
New  
Delhi  <ARG1
of  
using*  
its  
consulates  <ARG1
in  
Kandahar  
and  
Jalalabad  
to  
train*  
Balochi  
insurgents  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
are*  
active*  
in  
Pakistani  
Balochistan  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Pakistani  
officials  >ARG0
claim*  
there  
are*  
as  
many  
as  
42  
RAW  
agents  >ARG1
based*  
in  
Kandahar  <ARGM-LOC
and  
another  
12  
in  
Jalalabad  
.  

“  
There  >ARG0
have*  >>ARG1
no  
business  <ARG1
being*  
there  <ARG2
unless  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
undermining*  
Pakistan  <ARG1
,  
’’  
says*  
a  
Pakistani  
official  <ARG0
.  

Both  
India  >ARG0
and  
Afghanistan  
deny*  
the  
claim*  
.  

‘’  
Should  >ARGM-MOD
Pakistan  >ARG0
show*  >>ARGM-ADV
us  <ARG2
any  
evidence  <ARG1
of  
an  
Indian  
hand  >ARG0
using*  
Afghan  
soil  <ARG1
to  
work*  
against  
our  
neighbours  <ARG1
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
take*  >ARG1
it  <ARG1
very  
seriously  <ARG2
,  
”  
says*  
Amrullah  <ARG0
Saleh  
the  
head  
of  
Afghanistan  
’s  
National  
Security  
Directorate  
.  

Karzai  >ARG0
categorically  >ARGM-ADV
said*  
that  
he  >>ARG0
has*  
assured*  
Musharraf  <ARG1
repeatedly  <ARGM-ADV
that  
any  
adverse  >ARGM-ADJ
action*  >>ARG1
against  
Pakistan  <ARGM-GOL
taken*  
by  
Indian  
diplomats  <<ARG0
inside  
Afghanistan  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
acted*  
upon  <C-ARG1
swiftly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Senior  
US  
diplomats  >>ARG0
and  
military  
officials  
have*  
warned*  
India  <ARG2
also  <ARGM-DIS
.  

In  
a  
major  >ARGM-EXT
regional  >ARGM-ADJ
shift*  >>ARGM-ADV
reflecting*  
the  
newly  
strengthened  
position  <ARG2
of  
Karzai  
,  
Iran  >>ARG0
,  
Russia  
and  
India  
which  >>R-ARG0
have*  
traditionally  >ARGM-ADV
backed*  
the  
Tajik  
dominated  
former  
Northern  
Alliance  <ARG1
made*  >ARGM-LVB
strenuous  >ARGM-MNR
efforts*  
to  
convince*  
presidential  
candidate  
Younis  >>ARG0
Qanooni  
to  
strike*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
deal*  
with  
Karzai  <ARG1
before  
the  
elections*  
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
oppose*  
Karzai  <ARG1
.  

Iran  >ARG0
in  
particular  
feared*  
that  
Qanooni  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
loose*  
and  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
be*  
politically  >ARGM-MNR
isolated*  
from  
the  
mainstream  <ARG2
.  

Qanooni  >>ARG0
refused*  
to  
accept*  
the  
Iranian  
advice  <ARG1
as  
his  
fellow  
Panjsheri  
Tajiks  >ARG0
urged*  
him  >ARG0
to  
stand*  
against  
Karzai  <ARG2
.  

However  >>ARGM-ADV
since  
the  
elections*  >>ARGM-TMP
Iranian  >ARG0
influence*  >>ARG0
has*  
proved*  
critical  <ARG1
in  
convincing*  
the  
Hazara  
Shia  
candidate  >ARG0
Mohammed  
Mohaqeq  
to  
accept*  
the  
results  <ARG1
of  
the  
elections*  
and  
later  >ARGM-TMP
convincing*  
Qanooni  >ARG0
to  
do*  
the  
same  <ARG1
.  

With  
the  
US  
military  
presence  >ARG0
posing*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
threat  <ARG1
on  
their  
borders  <ARGM-LOC
in  
both  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
and  
Afghanistan  
,  
Iran  >ARG0
’s  
moderate  >ARGM-ADJ
leadership*  >>ARG0
is*  
keen*  
to  
help*  
stabilise*  
Karzai  <ARG1
so  
that  
the  
US  
presence  >>ARG1
in  
Afghanistan  
is*  
reduced*  
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
powerful  
hardliners  >>ARG0
in  
Tehran  
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
trying*  
to  
undermine*  
that  
strategy  <ARG1
and  
a  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
issue*  >>ARG0
is*  
likely*  
to  
deepen*  
the  
rift  <ARG1
with  
the  
moderates  
.  

Iranian  
officials  >>ARG1
are*  
deeply  >ARGM-EXT
concerned*  
about  
the  
US  >ARG0
occupation*  
of  
Shindand  <ARG1
,  
a  
massive  
Soviet  
-  
era  
airbase  
just  
30  
kilometres  
from  
Iran  
’s  
border  
.  

The  
enhanced  
US  
presence  >>ARG1
in  
western  
Afghanistan  
was*  
only  >ARGM-ADV
made*  
possible*  
after  
the  
ousting*  
of  
Ismail  >ARG1
Khan  
,  
the  
warlord  
and  
Governor  
of  
Herat  
province  
last  
month  <ARGM-TMP
,  
who  >R-ARG1
was*  
a  
close  
ally  <ARG2
of  
Iranian  
hardliners  
.  

Iranian  
officials  >ARG0
say*  
they  >>ARG0
made*  >ARGM-LVB
no  >ARGM-NEG
objections*  
to  
Khan  
’s  
ouster  <ARG1
because  
they  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
strengthen*  
Karzai  >ARG0
’s  
campaign*  
against  
warlords  <ARG1
.  

At  
a  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
heightened*  >ARGM-PRD
tensions*  
between  
Tehran  <ARG1
and  
Washington  
over  
Iran  
’s  
nuclear  
weapons  
program  <ARG0
and  
calls*  
by  
neo-conservatives  <ARG0
in  
Washington  
that  
a  
second  
Bush  >ARG0
term  
should  >ARGM-MOD
deal*  
with  
Iran  <ARG1
aggressively  <ARGM-MNR
,  
the  
Iranians  >ARG0
fear*  
that  
Shindand  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
used*  
as  
a  
listening  
post  <ARG2
,  
spying  
facility  
and  
even  
a  
launching  
pad  
for  
any  
future  >ARGM-TMP
US  >ARG0
actions*  
against  
Iran  <ARGM-GOL
.  

Afghan  
officials  >ARG0
say*  
the  
Americans  >>ARG0
have*  
moved*  
over  
100  
Special  
Forces  <ARG1
and  
helicopters  
to  
Shindand  <ARG2
.  

However  >ARGM-ADV
General  
Barno  >ARG0
insists*  
the  
US  
presence  >ARG0
poses*  
no  
threat  <ARG1
to  
Iran  
.  

‘’  
We  >ARG0
have*  >ARG1
a  
very  
small  
number  <ARG1
of  
forces  
in  
Shindand  
with  
a  
few  
helicopters  
,  
’’  
says*  
Barno  <ARG0
.  

Nevertheless  >ARGM-ADV
this  >ARG0
places*  
Karzai  <ARG1
in  
a  
difficult  
and  
sensitive  
situation  <ARG2
because  
he  >>ARG0
has*  
to  
maintain*  
excellent  >ARGM-MNR
relations*  
with  
both  
the  
US  <ARG2
and  
Iran  
.  

‘’  
Afghanistan  >>ARG0

had*  
the  
benefit*  
of  
cooperation*  
from  
both  
the

and  
Iran  
.  

So  
far  >>ARGM-ADV
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
have*  
done*  >>ARG1
together  <ARGM-MNR
has*  
been*  
good*  >>ARG1

that  >ARG1

how  >>ARG2
we  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
keep*  
it  <ARG1
’’  
,  
says*  
Karzai  <ARG0
.  

Nobody  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
claim*  
that  
the  
interference  >ARG1
of  
Afghanistan  
’s  
neighbours  
is*  
over  <ARG2
,  
but  
the  
elections*  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD

much  >>ARG0

Karzai  <ARG1
and  
deal*  
more  
firmly  <ARGM-MNR
with  
neighbours  
’  
interference  <ARG1
.  

In  
the  
post  
election  
scenario  >>ARGM-LOC
it  
is*  
becoming*  
abundantly  >ARGM-EXT
clear*  
that  
the  
Taliban  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
the  
support*  
of  
the  
Afghan  
people  <ARG0
nor  
the  
Afghan  
Pashtuns  
.  

In  
a  
highly  
significant  >ARGM-ADJ
move*  >ARGM-ADV
Afghan  
Pashtun  
tribes  >ARG0
along  
the  
Pakistan

warned*  
the

Quetta

Chaman  
that  
if  
they  >>ARG0

and  
disrupt*  
the  
elections*  
,  
they  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
resisted*  
.  

Many  
Taliban  >>ARG0
living*  
in  
Afghanistan  <ARGM-LOC
voted*  
for  
President  <ARG1
Karzai  
.  

It  
is*  
now  >ARGM-TMP

that  
with  
the  
rapidly  
changing  
face  >ARGM-CAU

the  
demise

The  
debate*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
a  
handful  >>ARG0
of  
Texas  
multi-millionnaires  
close  
to  
the  
Bush  
family  
have*  
cleverly  >ARGM-MNR
manufactured*  
over  
John  
Kerry  
's  
war  
record  
is*  
absurd*  
in  
every  
way*  
.  

The  
charges*  >>ARG1
that  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
put*  
some  
vets  <ARG1
up  <ARG2
to  
making*  
against  
Kerry  <<ARG1
are*  
false  <ARG2
and  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
demonstrated*  
by  
the  
historical  
record  <ARG0
to  
be*  
false  <ARG2
.  

Most  >>ARG0
of  
those  >>ARG0
making*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
charges*  
have*  
even  >ARGM-ADV
flip*  
-  
flopped  >C-V
,  
contradicting*  
themselves  <ARG1
.  

Or  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG0
were*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
eyewitnesses  <ARG2
and  
are*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
lying*  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
to  
address*  >>ARG1
the  
substance  <ARG1
of  
this  
Big  >ARGM-ADJ
Lie*  
is*  
to  
risk*  
falling*  
into  
its  
logic  <ARG2
.  

The  
true  
absurdity  >>ARG1
of  
the  
entire  
situation  
is*  
easily  >ARGM-ADV
appreciated*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
consider*  
that  
George  >ARG0
W.  
Bush  
never  >ARGM-NEG
showed*  
any  
bravery  <ARG1
at  
all  
at  
any  
point  <ARGM-TMP
in  
his  
life  
.  

He  >>ARG0
has*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
lived*  
in  
a  
war  
zone  <ARGM-LOC
.  

If  
some  >>ARG1
of  
John  
Kerry  
's  
wounds  
were*  
superficial*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Bush  >ARG0
received*  
no  
wounds  <ARG1
.  

(  
And  
,  
a  
piece  >>ARG2
of  
shrapnel  
in  
the  
forearm  
that  >R-ARG0

only  
a  
minor

have*  
killed*  
had  
it  >>ARG1
hit*  
an

danger  <ARG2
and  
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
absent*  
yourself  <ARG1
from  
it  <ARG2
.  

That  >ARG1
is*  
the  
logic  <ARG2
of  
the  
medal  
)  
.  

Kerry  >ARG0
saved*  
a  
man  
's  
life  <ARG1
while  
under  
fire*  
.  

Bush  >ARG0
did*  
no  
such  
thing  <ARG1
.  

What  >>ARG1
was*  
Bush  >ARG0
doing*  
with  
his  
youth  <ARG2
?  

He  >>ARG0
was*  
drinking*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
was*  
drinking*  
like  
a  
fish  <ARGM-MNR
,  
every  
night  <ARGM-TMP
,  
into  
the  
wee  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
.  

For  
decades  
.  

He  >>ARG1
gave*  >ARGM-LVB
no  
service*  
to  
anyone  <ARG2
,  
risked*  
nothing  <ARG1
,  
and  
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
slack*  
off  
efficiently  <ARGM-ADV
.  

The  
history  >>ARG1
of  
alcoholism  
and  
possibly  >ARGM-ADV
other  >ARGM-ADJ
drug  >ARG1
use*  
is*  
a  
key  >ARGM-ADJ
issue*  
because  
it  >>ARG0
not  
only  
speaks*  
to  
Bush  
's  
character  <ARG2
as  
an  
addictive  
personality  
,  
but  
may  >ARGM-MOD
tell*  
us  <ARG2
something  <ARG1
about  
his  >ARG0
erratic  >ARGM-ADJ
and  
alarming  
actions*  
as  
president  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

His  
explosive  
temper  >>ARG0
probably  >ARGM-ADV
provoked*  
the  
disastrous  
siege  <ARG1
of  
Fallujah  
last  
spring  
,  
killing*  
600  
Iraqis  <ARG1
,  
most  
of  
them  
women  
and  
children  
,  
in  
revenge  <ARGM-CAU
for  
the  
deaths*  
of  
4  
civilian  
mercenaries  <ARG1
,  
one  
of  
them  
a  
South  
African

(  
Newsweek  >ARG0

that

commanded*  
his  
cabinet  <ARG1
,  
"  
Let*  
heads  >ARG1
roll*  
!  
"  
)  

That  
temper  >ARG1
is*  
only  
one  
problem  <ARG2
.  

Bush  >ARG0
has*  
a  
sadistic  
streak  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
enjoyed*  
,  
as  
governor  <ARGM-PRD
,  
watching*  
executions*  
.  

His  
delight  >>ARG1
in  
killing*  
people  <ARG1
became*  
a  
campaign  >ARG0
issue*  
in  
2000  <<ARGM-TMP
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
seemed*  
,  
in  
one  
debate*  
,  
to  
enjoy*  
the  
prospect*  
of  
executing  <ARG1
wrong  
-  
doers  
a  
little  
too  
much  <<ARGM-EXT
.  

He  >>ARG0
has*  
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
gone*  
on  
enjoying*  
killing*  
people  <ARG1
on  
a  
large  
scale  <ARGM-MNR
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Drug  >ARG1
abuse*  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
affect*  
the  
ability  <ARG1
of  
the  
person  
to  
feel*  
deep  
emotions  <ARG1
like  
empathy  
.  

Two  
decades  >>ARG0
of  
pickling*  
his  
nervous  
system  <ARG1
in  
various  
highly  
toxic  
substances  <ARGM-MNR
have*  
left*  
Bush  <ARG1
damaged  
goods  <ARG1
.  

Even  
for  
those  >>ARGM-ADV
who  >R-ARG0

abstain*  
,  
"  
visual  
-

,  
are*  
the  
slowest  >ARG1
to  
recover*  
.  
"  

That  
he  >>ARG1
managed*  >>ARG1
to  
get*  
on  
the  
wagon  <ARG2
(  
though  
with  
that  
pretzel  
incident  >ARGM-ADV
,  
you  >ARG0
wonder*  
how  
firmly  <ARG1
)  
is*  
laudable  <ARG2
.  

But  
he  >ARG0
suffers*  
the  
severe  >ARGM-ADJ
effects*  
of  
the  
aftermath  <ARG0
,  
and  
we  >>ARG0
are*  
all  >ARGM-ADV
suffering*  
along  
with  
him  <ARGM-COM
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
since  
he  >ARG1
is*  
the  
most  
powerful  
man  <ARG2
in  
the  
world  
.  

We  >ARG0
all  
know*  
by  
now  <ARGM-TMP
that  
Bush  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
do*  
his  >ARG0
full  >ARGM-EXT
service*  
with  
the  
Texas

absenting*  
himself  <ARG1

the  
Alabama  >ARGM-LOC
senate  >ARG1
campaign*  
of  
Winton  <ARG0

Blount  
.  

Whether  
he  >ARG1
was*  
actually  
AWOL  >>ARG1
during  
this  
stint  <ARGM-TMP
is*  
unclear*  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
it  
is*  
clear*  
that  
not  
only  
did  
Bush  >ARG1
slack*  
off  
on  
his  >ARG0

but  
he  >ARG1

working*  
for  <C-ARG2

Red  
Blount  
,  
had*  
gotten*  
rich*  
in  
Alabama  <ARGM-LOC
in  
the  
construction  
business  <ARGM-ADV

Prominent  
Southern  
Republicans  >ARG1
were*  
something  <ARG2
of  
a  
rare  
breed  
in  
those  
days  <ARGM-TMP

Blount  >ARG0
's  
support*  >ARG0

him  >>ARG1

appointed*  
Richard

postmaster  
general  <ARG2

In

with  
Mr.

then

That  >ARG1
was*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
26  
-  
year  
-  
old  
Lieutenant  
Bush  >ARG1
came*  
to  
Montgomery  <ARG4

at  
his  
father  >ARG0

Back  
in  
1972  >>ARGM-TMP

the

But  >ARGM-DIS
throughout  
Alabama  >ARGM-LOC

there  
were*  
Republicans  >>ARG0
and  
Democrats  
who  >>R-ARG0
wanted*  
to  
help*  
Red  <ARG2

It  
was*

this

understand*  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
even  
in

Well  >>ARGM-DIS

I  >>ARG0
was*  
coming*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
early  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
morning  
and  
leaving*  
in  
mid-evenings  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Ordinarily  >ARGM-ADV
,  
George  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
come*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
around  
noon  <ARGM-TMP
;  
he  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
ordinarily  >ARGM-ADV
leave*  
around  
5:30  <ARGM-TMP

6:00  
in

evening  
.  

GOODWYN  
:  
Archibald  >ARG0
says*  
that  
two  
months  
before  
the  
election*  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
in  
September  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
'72  
,  
Red  
Blount  
's  
campaign  
manager  >>ARG0
came*  
to  
him  <ARG4
and  
asked*  
that  
he  >ARG0
quietly  >ARGM-MNR
take*  
over  
Mr.  
Bush  
's  
job  <ARG1
because  
the  
campaign  
materials  >>ARG1
were*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
getting*  
out  
to  
the  
counties  <ARG3
.  

Mr.  
ARCHIBALD  
:  
George  >>ARG1
certainly  >>ARGM-ADV
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem*  
to  
have*  >ARGM-LVB

concerns*  
about

over

.  

My  >ARG1
overall  >ARGM-ADJ

was*  
that  
he  >>ARG1
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem*  
as  
interested*  
in  
the

as  
the  
other  
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
were*  
working*  
at  
the  
state  
headquarters  <ARG2
.  

GOODWYN  
:  
Murph  >ARG0
Archibald  
says*  
that  
at  
first  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
he  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
that  
Mr.  >>ARG0
Bush  
was*  
serving*  
in  
the  
Air  
National  
Guard  <ARG1
.  

After  
he  >ARG0
found*  >ARGM-TMP
out  
from  
somebody  <ARG2
else  
,  
Archibald  >>ARG0
attempted*  
to  
talk*  
to  
Mr.  <ARG2
Bush  
about  
it  <ARG1
.  

The  
president  >ARG1
was*  
a  
lieutenant  <ARG2
and  
Archibald  >>ARG1
had*  
been*  
a  
lieutenant  <ARG2
,  
too  <ARGM-ADV
;  
he  >ARG0
figured*  
they  >ARG0
had*  
something  >ARG1
to  
talk*  
about  <C-ARG1
.  

Mr.  
ARCHIBALD  
:  
George  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
any  
interest*  
at  
all  <ARGM-EXT
in  
talking*  
about  
the  
military  <ARG1
.  

In  
fact  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
broached*  >ARGM-TMP
the  
subject  <ARG1
with  
him  <ARGM-COM
,  
he  >ARG0
simply  >ARGM-ADV
changed*  
the  
subject  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG1
was*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
unpleasant  <ARG2
about  
it  
,  
but  
he  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
changed*  
the  
subject  <ARG1
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
talk*  
about  
it  <ARG1
.  

GOODWYN  
:  
Far  >ARGM-LOC
from  
Texas  
and  
Washington  
,  
DC  
,  
Mr.  >ARG0
Bush  
enjoyed*  
his  
freedom  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
dated*  
a  
beautiful  
young  
woman  >ARG0
working*  
on  
the  
campaign*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
went*  
out  
in  
the  
evenings  <ARGM-TMP
and  
had*  
a  
good  
time  <ARG1
.  

In  
fact  >ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >ARG0
left*  
the  
house  <ARG1
he  >ARG0
rented*  
in  
such  
disrepair  <ARGM-MNR
--  
with  
damage*  
to  
the  
walls  <ARG1
and  
a  
chandelier  >ARG1
destroyed*  
--  
that  
the  
Montgomery  
family  >>ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
owned*  
it  <ARG1
still  >ARGM-TMP
grumble*  
about  
the  
unpaid  
repair  
bill  <ARG1
.  

Archibald  >ARG0
says*  
Mr.  >>ARG0
Bush  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
come*  
into  
the  
office  <ARG2
and  
,  
in  
a  
friendly  >ARGM-MNR
way*  >ARGM-MNR
,  
offer*  
up  <ARGM-DIR
stories  <ARG1
about  
the  
drinking*  >ARGM-PRR
he  <ARG0
'd  
done*  
the  
night  <<ARGM-TMP
before  
,  
kind  
of  
as  
a  
conversation  
starter  <<ARGM-PRD
.  

Mr.  
ARCHIBALD  
:  
People  >ARG0
have*  
different  >ARGM-ADJ
ways*  
of  
starting*  
the  
days  <ARG1
in  
any  
office  <ARGM-LOC
.  

They  >>ARG0
're*  
going*  
to  
talk*  
about  
their  
kids  <ARG1
,  
they  >>ARG0
're*  
going*  
to  
talk*  
about  
football  <ARG1
,  
they  >>ARG0
're*  
going*  
to  
talk*  
about  
the  
weather  <ARG1
.  

And  
this  >ARG1
was*  
simply  <ARGM-ADV
his  
opening  
gambit  <ARG2
;  
he  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
start*  
talking*  
about  
that  
he  >>ARG0
had*  
been*  
out  <ARG2
late  <ARGM-TMP
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
before  
drinking*  
.  

GOODWYN  
:  
Archibald  >ARG0
says*  
the  
frequency  >>ARG1
with  
which  >R-ARGM-ADV
Mr.  >ARG0
Bush  
discussed*  
the  
subject  <ARG1
was*  
off  
-  
putting  <ARG2
to  
him  <ARGM-GOL
.  

Mr.  
ARCHIBALD  
:  
I  >ARG0
mean*  
,  
at  
that  
time  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG1
was*  
28  <ARG2
;  
George  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
25  <ARG2
or  
26  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
thought*  
it  
was*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
unusual*  
that  
someone  >ARG0
in  
their  
mid-20s  
would  >ARGM-MOD
initiate*  
conversations*  
,  
particularly  
in  
the  
context  <<ARGM-ADV
of  
something  
as  
serious  
as  
a  
US  >ARG1
senatorial  >ARG1
campaign*  
,  
by  
talking*  
about  
their  >ARG0
drinking*  
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
before  
.  

I  >ARG0
thought*  
it  >>ARG1
unusual*  
and  
,  
frankly  >ARGM-ADV
,  
inappropriate*  
.  

GOODWYN  
:  
According  
to  
Archibald  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Mr.  >ARG0
Bush  
would  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
tell*  
stories  <ARG1
about  
his  
days  
at  
Yale  
in  
New  
Haven  
,  
and  
how  >>ARGM-ADV
whenever  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG1
got*  
pulled*  
over  
for  
erratic  >ARGM-MNR
driving*  
,  
he  >>ARG0
was*  
let*  
go*  
after  
the  
officers  >ARG0
discovered*  
he  >ARG1
was*  
the  
grandson  <ARG2
of  
a  
Connecticut  
US  
senator  
.  

Archibald  >>ARG0
,  
a  
middle  
-  
class  
Alabama  
boy  >>ARG1
--  
who  >>R-ARG1
,  
by  
the  
way*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
is*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
a  
registered  
Democrat  <ARG2
--  
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like*  
that  
story  <ARG1
.  

Mr.  
ARCHIBALD  
:  
He  >ARG0
told*  
us  <ARG2
whenever  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG1
was*  
stopped*  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
as  
soon  >>ARGM-TMP
as  
the  
law  
enforcement  >ARG0
found*  
out  
that  
he  >ARG1
was*  
the  
grandson  <ARG2
of  
Prescott  
Bush  
,  
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
let*  
him  >ARG0
go*  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
he  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
always  >ARGM-TMP
laugh*  
about  
that  <ARG2
.  
"  

Goodwyn  >ARG0
dutifully  >ARGM-MNR
notes*  
that  
Baba  >>ARG0
Groom  
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
remember*  
George  >ARG0
telling*  
drunk  
stories  <ARG1
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
that  >ARG1
means*  
nothing  <ARG2
,  
since  
they  >ARG1
were*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
the  
sort  >ARG1
of  
things  
guys  >ARG0
like  
Bush  
told*  
the  
"  
girls  <ARG2
"  
.  

He  >>ARG0
was*  
trying*  
to  
buddy*  
with  
Archibald  <ARG1
and  
impress*  
him  <ARG1
.  

Again  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
decades  >>ARG0
of  
this  
sort  
of  
behavior  
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
leave*  
a  
person  <ARG1
untouched  
.  

Our  
world  >ARG1
is*  
in  
crisis  <ARG2
and  
our  
Republic  >ARG1
is*  
in  
danger  <ARG2
.  

It  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
left*  
in  
the  
hands  <C-ARG1
of  
a  
man  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
spent*  
his  
life  <ARG1
like  
this  <ARGM-MNR
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
the  
cities  >ARG1
are*  
on  
fire*  
with  
the  
burning  
flesh  <<ARGM-MNR
of  
men  

Just  >ARGM-ADV
remember*  
that  
death*  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
end*  

And  >ARGM-DIS
you  >>ARG0
search*  
in  
vain  <ARGM-MNR
to  
find*  
just  
one  
law  >ARG1
abiding*  
citizen  <<ARG1

Just  >ARGM-ADV
remember*  
that  
death*  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
end*

Afraid  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
time  >ARGM-TMP
today  <ARGM-TMP
to  
discuss*  
these  <ARG1
,  
but  
some  
stories  >ARG0
need*  
attention*  
:  

From  
Wednesday  
's  
Mirror  
the  
headline  
,  
"  
Have*  
200,000  
AK47s  >ARG1
Fallen*  
Into  
the  
Hands  <ARG4
of  
Iraq  
Terrorists  
?  
"  

(  
also  >ARGM-DIS
see*  
this  
thread  <ARG1
on  
the  
RI  
discussion  
board  
)  
:  

Some  
200,000  
guns  >>ARG1
the  
US  >ARG0
sent*  
to  
Iraqi  
security  
forces  <ARG2
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
smuggled*  
to  
terrorists  <ARG3
,  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
feared*  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
99  
-  
tonne  
cache  >>ARG1
of  
AK47s  
was*  
to  
have*  
been*  
secretly  >ARGM-MNR
flown*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
from  
a  
US  
base  <ARGM-DIR
in  
Bosnia  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
four  
planeloads  >>ARG1
of  
arms  
have*  
vanished*  
.  

Orders*  >>ARGM-PRR
for  
the  
deal*  >ARG0
to  
go*  
ahead  <ARG2
were*  
given*  
by  
the  
US  
Department  
of  
Defense  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
work*  >>ARG1
was*  
contracted*  
out  
via  
a  
complex  
web  <ARGM-MNR
of  
private  
arms  
traders  
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
Moldovan  
airline  >>ARG1
used*  
to  
transport*  
the  
shipment  <ARG1
was*  
blasted*  
by  
the  
UN  <ARG0
in  
2003  <ARGM-TMP
for  
smuggling*  
arms  <ARG1
to  
Liberia  <ARG3
,  
human  >ARG1
rights*  
group  
Amnesty  >>ARG0
has*  
discovered*  
.  

It  >ARG1
follows*  
a  
separate  
probe  >ARG0
claiming*  
that  
thousands  >>ARG0
of  
guns  
meant*  
for  
Iraq  
's  
police  <ARG2
and  
army  
instead  >ARGM-ADV
went*  
to  
al  
-  
Qaeda  <ARG4
.  

Amnesty  
chief  
spokesman  
Mike  >ARG0
Blakemore  
said*  
:  
"  
It  
's*  
unbelievable*  
that  
no  
one  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
account*  
for  
200,000  
assault  
rifles  <ARG1
.  

If  
these  
weapons  >>ARG1
have*  
gone*  >ARGM-ADV
missing  <ARG2
it  >ARG1
's*  
a  
terrifying  >ARGM-MNR
prospect*  
.  
"  

American  
defence  
chiefs  >ARG0
hired*  
a  
US  
firm  >ARG0
to  
take*  
the  
guns  <ARG1
,  
from  
the  
90s  >ARGM-TMP
Bosnian  >ARG1
war*  
,  
to  
Iraq  <<ARG3
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
air  
traffic  
controllers  >ARG0
in  
Baghdad  
have*  
no  
record  <ARG1
of  
the  
flights*  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
supposedly  >ARGM-ADV
took*  
off  
between  
July  <ARGM-TMP
2004  
and  
July  
2005  
.  

A  
coalition  
forces  
spokesman  >>ARG0
confirmed*  
they  >>ARG0
had*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
received*  
"  
any  
weapons  <ARG1
from  
Bosnia  <ARG2
"  
and  
added*  
they  >>ARG0
were*  
"  
not  >ARGM-NEG
aware*  
of  
any  
purchases*  
for  
Iraq  <ARG4
from  
Bosnia  <ARG2
"  
.  

Nato  
and  
US  
officials  >>ARG0
have*  
already  >>ARGM-TMP
voiced*  
fears*  
that  
Bosnian  
arms  >>ARG1
-  
sold*  
by  
US  
,  
British  
and  
Swiss  
firms  <ARG0
-  
are*  
being*  
passed*  
to  
insurgents  <ARG2
.  

A  
NATO  
spokesman  >ARG0
said*  
:  
"  
There  
's*  
no  
tracking  
mechanism  >ARG0
to  
ensure*  
they  >>ARG1
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
fall*  
into  
the  
wrong  
hands  <ARG4
.  

There  
are*  
concerns*  
that  
some  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
siphoned*  
off  
.  
"  

This  
year  >ARGM-TMP
a  
newspaper  >ARG0
claimed*  
two  
UK  
firms  >>ARG1
were*  
involved*  
in  
a  
deal*  >>ARGM-CAU
in  
which  >>R-ARGM-CAU
thousands  >>ARG1
of  
guns  
for  
Iraqi  
forces  
were*  
re-routed*  
to  
al  
-

The  
Moldovan  
airline  >ARG1
is*  
Aerocom  <ARG2
,  
and  
yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
it  >ARG1
's*  
one  <ARG2
of  
Victor

.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
always  <ARGM-TMP
a  
bang*  
-  
your  
-  
head  <ARG1
-  
against  
-  
the  
-  
wall  <ARG2
moment  <<ARG2
,  
reading*  
again  <ARGM-TMP
the  
play*  >ARG1
the  
incompetence  
theory  >ARG0
receives*  
,  
even  
from  
some  <ARG2
of  
the  
Administration*  
's  
harshest  
mainstream  
critics  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
then  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
even  >ARGM-ADV
to  
talk*  >>ARG1
of  
an  
"  
administration*  
"  
may  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
misdirection*  
at  
this  
point  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
given  
how  
little  >ARG2
representative  
government  >ARG1
means*  
in  
the  
United  
States  <ARGM-LOC
these  
days  <ARGM-TMP

and  
how  
much  >>ARG1

national  
security

has*  
been*  
privatized*  
into  
a  
global  
gangland  <ARGM-GOL
of  
drugs  
and  
guns  
.  

Like  
the  
tens  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
billions  
of  
dollars  
that  >>R-ARG1
have*  
been*  
"  
lost*

n't  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADV
"  
vanish*  
"  
;  
not  
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
Pentagon  >ARG0
contracts*  
the  
work*  
to  
an  
international  
criminal  <<ARG2

stature

But  >ARGM-DIS
Bout

to  
be*  
mentioned*  
in  
whatever  >ARGM-ADJ
coverage*  >ARG1

story  >ARG0

,  
before  
it  >ARG1

so  
many  
others  <ARGM-MNR
beneath  
the

's  
frothing*  
triviality  <ARG1

Meanwhile  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
a  
decision*  >>ARG1
's*  
been*  
reached*  
in  
the  
trial*  
of  
Toledo  
priest  
Gerald  <ARG1
Robinson  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
it  >ARG1
's*  
guilty  <ARG2
:  

The  
Rev.  >ARG1
Gerald  
Robinson  
appeared*  
stony  
-  
faced  <C-ARG1
as  
the  
jury  
's  
guilty  
verdict  >>ARG1
was*  
read*  
,  
and  
he  >>ARG0
blinked*  
repeatedly  <ARGM-ADV
and  
glanced*  
at  
his  
lawyers  <ARG1
before  
being*  
led*  
away  <ARGM-DIR
in  
handcuffs  <ARGM-MNR
.  

...  

The  
crime  >ARG1
occurred*  
in  
the  
sacristy  >ARG1
adjoining*  
the  
hospital  
chapel  <ARG2
in  
downtown  
Toledo  <<ARGM-LOC
on  
the  
Saturday  <<ARGM-TMP
before  
Easter  
in  
1980  <<ARGM-TMP

Investigators  >ARG0
said*  
the  
nun  >>ARG1
,  
Margaret  
Ann  
Pahl  
,  
71  
,  
was*  
strangled*  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
stabbed*  
,  
with  
nine  
wounds  >ARG0

her

Small

in  
the  
southwestern  
US  <ARGM-LOC

the

toward  
the

in  
recent  
years  <<ARGM-TMP

[

some  
10,000  
followers  <ARG4

several  
southwestern  
communities  
with  
estimated  
assets  
of  
$  
110  
million  
;  
when  >>ARGM-TMP

became*  
clear*  
that  
government  
officials  >>ARG1
,  
school  
authorities  
,  
and  
police  
in  
those  
communities  
had*  
become*  
intertwined  <ARG2
with  
the  
sect  
;  
when  >ARGM-TMP
ex-members  >ARG0
increasingly  >ARGM-ADV
reported*  
child  >>ARG2
and  
sexual  >ARGM-MNR
abuse*  
charges*  >ARG2
(  
mainly  >ARGM-ADV

underage

to

;  
and  
when  >>ARGM-TMP

to  
use*  
secluded  
compounds  <ARG1

and

Arizona  
with  
sexual  >ARGM-MNR

of

with  
arranging*  
"  
spiritual  >ARGM-ADJ

for

in  
Salt

In

The  
Raw  
Story  

i  >ARG0
count*  
like  <ARGM-DIS
14  
explosive  
headlines  <ARG1
.  

Then  >ARGM-ADV
,  
of  >ARGM-ADV
course  
,  
there  
is*  
the  
evidence  >>ARG1
the  
jury  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
hear*  
about  <C-ARG1
in  
the  
Robinson  >ARG2
case*  
...  

Funny  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
some  
things  >>ARG1
are*  
squirelled*  
away  
by  
well  
-  
meaning  
prosecutors  <ARG0
...  

Maybe  
because  
they  >ARG0
hint*  
at  
a  
larger  
conspiracy  <ARG1
/  
network  
of  
abusers  
/  
satanic  
underground  
?  

I  >ARG0
read*  
of  
a  
case*  >>ARGM-TMP
not  
long  <<ARGM-TMP
ago  
when  >>R-ARGM-TMP
some  
people  >>ARG0
were*  
trying*  
to  
get*  
a  
polygamous  
judge  >ARG0
taken*  
off*  
the  
bench  <ARG1
for  
not  >ARGM-NEG
obeying*  
state  
law  <ARG1
.  

Of  >>ARGM-ADV
course  
law  
enforcement  >>ARG0
has*  
dragged*  
it's  
feet  <ARG1
when  >>ARGM-TMP
members  >>ARG0
are*  
taking*  
part  <ARG1
in  
the  
activity  <ARG2
themselves  <ARGM-PRD
.  

Personally  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
give*  
a  
damn  <ARG1
what  >ARG1
adults  >ARG0
do*  
to  
one  
another  <ARG2
as  
long  <ARGM-ADV
as  
there  
is*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
abuse*  >ARG1
invovled*  
.  

It  
is*  
the  
marrying*  >ARG0
off  
of  
young  
girls  <ARG1
to  
older  
men  <ARG2
often  
close  
relatives  
that  >R-ARG0
enfurates*  
me  <ARG1
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
these  
cults  >ARG0
have*  
multimillions  <ARG1
yet  
the  
women  >ARG0
and  
kids  
live*  
in  
poverty  <ARGM-MNR
so  
the  
leaders  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
live*  
the  
high  
life  <ARG1
.  

In  
the  
Warren  
Jeffs  
cult  >ARGM-LOC
he  >ARG0
reassigns*  
wives  <ARG1
if  
the  
husband  >ARG0
displeases*  
him  <ARG1
or  
to  
reward*  
the  
new  
husband  <ARG1
.  

Husbands  >ARG1
marry*  
mothers  <ARG2
and  
teen  
daughters  
at  
the  
same  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

a  
rare  
form  >>ARG1
of  
retardation*  
is*  
showing*  
up  
in  
that  
group  <ARGM-LOC
more  <ARGM-EXT
than  
anywhere  
else  
in  
the  
world  
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
genetic  <ARG2
and  
the  
child  >>ARG1
needs*  
to  
get*  
the  
gene  <ARG1
from  
both  
parents  <ARG2
to  
turn*  
into  
a  
vegetable  <ARG2

of  
a  
thinking  
child  <ARG2

The  
doctor  >ARG0
begs*  
them  >>ARG1

stop*  
intermarrying*  
but  
they  >ARG0
say*  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
keep*  
the  
blood  <ARG1
pure  <ARG2
.  

look*  
up  
fumarase  
deficiency  <ARG1
for  
more  
info  <ARGM-PRP
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
look*  
up  
the  
kingston  
family  <ARG1
.  

One  
member  >>ARG1
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
was*  
convicted*  
of  
beating*  
his  
teen  
daughter  <ARG1
unconcious  <ARGM-PRD
when  >ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG0
ran*  
away  <ARGM-DIR
from  
'  
marriage*  
'  
to  
her  
father  
's  
own  
brother  <ARG2
.  

no  
one  >>ARG1
was*  
charged*  
for  
forced*  >ARGM-PRD
marriage*  
,  
only  
the  
beating*  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
we  >ARG0
"  
lost*  
"  
some  
weapon  <ARG1
?  

It  >ARG1
's*  
a  
good  
thing  <ARG2
too  <ARGM-ADV
.  

We  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
those  
terrorists  >ARG2
to  
run*  
out*  
of  
shit  >ARG2
to  
shoot*  
at  
us  <ARG1
.  

Then  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
war*  >ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
stop*  
&  
all  
those  
juicy  >ARGM-ADJ
profits*  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
evaporate*  
.  

What  >ARG1
's*  
a  
few  
dead  
soldiers  <ARG2
in  
comparison*  
to  
keeping*  
all  
those  
defense  
contractors  <ARG1
awash  <ARG2
in  
all  
that  
tax  
cash  
?  

They  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
are*  
milking*  
the  
incompetence  
angle  <ARG1
though  <ARGM-DIS
,  
are*  
n't  
they  
?  

Just  
another

,  
huh  
?  

Christ  >ARGM-DIS

you  >ARG0

I  >ARG0

it  
's*

for

the

when  <ARGM-TMP

Perhaps  >ARGM-DIS
we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
look*  
at  
the  
death  
metal  
phenomenon  <ARG1
less  
as  
an  
invitation*

as  
a

a

which  >>R-ARG0

a  
lot  <ARG1

lip  >ARG1

to

does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG

very  
far  <<ARGM-EXT

their  >ARG0

The

They  >>ARG0

for

the

the

all  >>ARG1

Adolf  >>ARG0

an

in  
1937  <ARGM-TMP

Here  >ARG2
's*  
a  
quick  
overview  <ARG1
of  
the  
Entartete

(  
Degenerate  
Art  
)  
exhibit  
of  
1937  
:  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art  

Ironically  
(  
or  
perhaps  
not  
)  
,  
the  
notion  >>ARG1
of  
the  
'  
degenerate  
'  
and  
'  
degenerate  
art  
'  
was*  
appropriated*  
by  
the  
Nazis  <ARG0
and  
its  >ARG1
origins*  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
traced*  
back  <ARG2
to  
Jewish  
'  
intellectual  
'  
Max  
Nordau  
and  
a  
1892  
book  >>ARG1
he  >ARG0
authored*  
called*  
Degeneration  <ARG2
.  
.  

Nordau  >ARG1
was*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
the  
co  
founder  <ARG2
of  
the  
World  
Zionist  
Organization  
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
apparently  
cognitively  
functional  >>ARG0
take*  >>ARGM-TMP
actions*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
seem*  
senseless  <C-ARG1
and  
incompetent*  
,  
it  >ARG1
is*  
a  
most  
certain  >ARGM-ADJ
sign*  
that  
they  >ARG0
have*  
ulterior  
or  
hidden  
motives  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
trust*  
you  >>ARG1
and  
me  
to  
be*  
befuddled*  
by  
their  >ARG0
actions*  
,  
while  
they  >ARG0
"  
do*  
as  
they  
wilt  <ARGM-PRD
.  
"  

A  
question*  
:  

Are*  
the  
adherent  >>ARG0
of  
'  
Crowleyan  
Thelema  
'  
and  
others  
of  
similar  
ilk  
appropriating*  
or  
appropriating*  
from  
the  
appropriators  <ARGM-DIR
to  
redirect*  
'  
energy  <ARG1
?  
'  

Does*  
this  
reappropriation*  >>ARG1
lead*  
to  <ARG4
or  
originate*  
from  <ARG2
the  
same  
place  <ARG2
?  

Seems*  
as  
if  
there  
is*  
a  
clear  >ARGM-ADJ
distinction*  >>ARGM-PRR
being*  
made*  
between  
the  
'  
imaginary  
'  
Whore  
of  
Babalon  
and  
the  
actually  
Whore  >ARG1
of  
Babylon  
,  
which  >R-ARG1
is*  
this  
global  
system  <ARG2
.  

Is*  
the  
distinction*  >>ARG1
accurate*  
and  
valid*  
?  

Does*  
the  
distinction*  >ARG1
actually  >ARGM-ADV
exist*  
?  

This  >ARG1
is*  
where  >ARGM-LOC
the  
socio  
-  
political  
aspect  >ARG1
of  
this  
conundrum  
comes*  
into  
play*  
.  

Confused  
?  

Good  
.  

so  >ARGM-DIS
,  
enemy  >ARGM-DIS
,  
what  >ARG2
's*  
your  
point  <ARG1
?  

Why  >>ARGM-CAU
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
you  >ARG0
state*  
it  <ARG1
?  

My  
point  >ARG1
is*  
that  
these  >ARG1
are*  
all  <ARGM-ADV
just  >ARGM-ADJ
questions*  
and  
I  >>ARG0
am*

the

questions*  >ARG0
permeate*  
the  
entire

Western  
(  
Mystery  
)  
Tradition  <ARG1
'  
and  
perhaps  
'  
Eastern  
'  
as  
well  
,  
as  
they  >ARG1
relate*  
to  
the  
confluence  <ARG2
of  
politics  
and  
spirituality  
.  

For  
example  >ARGM-DIS
,  
is*  
the  
system  <ARG1
of  
Crowleyan  
Thelema  
a  
failed  >ARGM-PRD
alchemical  >ARG1
process*  
?  

Or  
was*  
it  >>ARG1
supposed*  
to  
initially  >ARGM-TMP
be*  
a  
process*  
of  
alchemical  >ARGM-MNR
appropriation*  
?  

Similarly  >ARGM-ADV
,  
is*  
invoking*  
ancient  
Egyptian  
gods  <ARG1
and  
goddesses  
a  
reaffirmation*  
of  
an  
oppressive  
and  
hierarchical  
system  <ARG1
?  

In  
my  
opinion  >ARGM-ADV
,  
people  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
no  
longer  >ARGM-NEG
afford*  
to  
partition*  
out  <ARG2
and  
compartmentalize*  
personal  
spiritual  
and  
political  
systems  <ARG1
.  

The  
'  
high  
weirdness  >>ARG1
'  
and  
more  
hardcore  
political  
'  
factions  
'  
must  >>ARGM-MOD
perhaps  >>ARGM-ADV
integrate*  
and  
arrive*  
at  
a  
synthesis  <ARG4
.  

In  
regards*  >ARGM-ADV
to  
death  
metal  <ARG1
,  
the  
problem  >ARG1
is*  
,  
once  
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
a  
question*  
of  
education*  
,  
history  
and  
the  
vacuous  >ARGM-ADJ
lack*  
of  
perspective  <ARG1
in  
American  
culture  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Shall  >ARGM-MOD
we  >ARG0
censor*  
the  
works*  
of  
poet  
Charles  <ARG0
Baudelaire  
as  <<ARGM-ADV

?  

Baudelaire  >ARG1

from  
me

,  
and  
I  >ARG0
apologize*  
for  
my

My  
real  
problem  >ARG1
is*  
with  
literalist  
fundamentalists  <ARG2
,  
of  
any  
religion  
.  

True  
believers  >ARG1

I  >>ARG1

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG2
'm*  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
clear*  
on  
the  
fact  <ARG1
that

the

a

and  
as  
a  
tool  >ARG2

the

It

the

that

I  >>ARG0

Whie  
I  >>ARG0

to  
the

that  
the  
things  >>ARG0

(  
which  >>R-ARG1

patently  
rediculous  <ARG2

,  
it  
does*  
bother*  
me  <ARG1

out  
a

in  
a  
vacuum  <ARG1
.  

Again  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
think*  
the

people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0

to  
far  <ARG2

their

to

(  
The

of  
religion  <ARG1

is*  
a  
whole

I  >ARG0

respect*  
for

who  >R-ARG0

to  
non-violence  <ARG2

it  
's*

that

do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG

a

The  
fact  >>ARG1
that  
the

"  
As  
you  >ARG0

I  >ARG0
usually  >ARGM-TMP
provide*  
the  
scientific  
and  
technological  
"  
entertainment  <ARG1
"  
in  
our  >ARG0
meetings*  
,  
but  
,  
on  
this  
occasion*  >ARGM-TMP
,  
our  
Chairman  >ARG0
suggested*  
that  
I  >ARG0
present*  
my  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-ADJ
personal  >ARGM-ADJ
view*  
on  
events  <ARG1
in  
the  
part  
of  
the  
world  >ARG3
from  
which  >R-ARG3
I  >ARG1
come*  
.  

I  >>ARG1
have*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
been*  
and  
I  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
a  
Government  
official  <ARG2
and  
I  >ARG0
have*  
no  
privileged  
information  <ARG1
.  

My  
perspective  >>ARG1
is*  
entirely  >ARGM-EXT
based*  
on  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
see*  
,  
on  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
read*  
and  
on  
the  
fact  
that  
my  
family  >>ARG0
has*  
lived*  
in  
this  
region  <ARGM-LOC
for  
almost  
200  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

You  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
regard*  
my  >ARG0
views*  
as  
those  >>ARG1
of  
the  
proverbial  
taxi  
driver  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
you  >>ARG1
are*  
supposed*  
to  
question*  
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
visit*  
a  
country  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
shared*  
with  
you  <ARG2
some  
fascinating  
facts  <ARG1
and  
some  
personal  >ARGM-ADJ
thoughts*  
about  
the  
Israeli  
-  
Arab  >ARG0
conflict*  
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
touch*  
upon  
it  <ARG1
only  
in  
passing*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
prefer*  
to  
devote*  
most  <ARG1
of  
my  >ARG0
remarks*  
to  
the  
broader  
picture  <<ARG2
of  
the  
region  
and  
its  
place  
in  
world  
events  
.  

I  >ARG0
refer*  
to  
the  
entire  
area  >>ARG2
between  
Pakistan  
and  
Morocco  
,  
which  >>R-ARG2
is*  
predominantly  
Arab  <ARG2
,  
predominantly  
Moslem  
,  
but  
includes*  
many  
non-Arab  
and  
also  
significant  
non-Moslem  
minorities  <ARG1
.  

Why  >>ARGM-CAU
do*  
I  >ARG0
put*  
aside  <ARG2
Israel  <ARG1
and  
its  
own  
immediate  
neighborhood  
?  

Because  
Israel  >>ARG1
and  
any  
problems  
related  
to  
it  
,  
in  
spite  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
read*  
or  
hear*  
in  
the  
world  
media  <ARG2
,  
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
central  >ARGM-ADJ
issue*  
,  
and  
has*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
been*  
the  
central  >ARGM-ADJ
issue*  
in  
the  
upheaval*  
in  
the  
region  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
there  
is*  
a  
100  
year  
-  
old  >ARGM-TMP
Israeli  
-  
Arab  >ARG0
conflict*  
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
where  >>ARG2
the  
main  >ARGM-ADJ
show*  >ARG1
is*  
.  

The  
millions  >>ARG0
who  >R-ARG1
died*  
in  
the  
Iran  
-  
Iraq  >ARG0
war*  
had*  
nothing  >ARG2

do*  
with  
Israel  <ARG1
.  

The  
mass  >ARGM-ADJ
murder*  >>ARG0
happening*  
right  
now  <ARGM-TMP
in  
Sudan  >>ARGM-LOC
,  
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
the  
Arab  
Moslem  
regime  >>ARG0
is*  
massacring*  
its  
black  
Christian  
citizens  <ARG1
,  
has*  
nothing  >ARG2
to  
do*  
with  
Israel  <ARG1
.  

The  
frequent  >ARGM-TMP
reports*  >>ARG0
from  
Algeria  <ARG0
about  
the  
murders*  
of  
hundreds  <ARG1
of  
civilians  
in  
one  
village  <ARGM-LOC
or  
another  
by  
other  
Algerians  <ARG0
have*  
nothing  >ARG2
to  
do*  
with  
Israel  <ARG1

Saddam  >>ARG0
Hussein  
did*  
not  >>ARGM-NEG
invade*  
Kuwait  <ARG1
,  
endanger*  
Saudi  
Arabia  <ARG1
and  
butcher*  
his  
own

of  
Israel  <ARGM-CAU

Egypt  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
use*  
poison  
gas  <ARG1
against  
Yemen  <ARGM-GOL
in  
the  
60's  <ARGM-TMP
because  
of  
Israel  <ARGM-CAU
.  

Assad  >>ARG0
the  
Father  
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
kill*  
tens  <ARG1
of  
thousands  <ARG1
of  
his  
own  
citizens  
in  
one  
week  <ARGM-TMP
in  
El  
Hamma  <ARGM-LOC
in  
Syria  
because  
of  
Israel  <ARGM-CAU
.  

The  
Taliban  >ARG0
control*  >>ARG0
of  
Afghanistan  <ARG1
and  
the  
civil  >ARGM-ADJ
war*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
had*  
nothing  >ARG2
to  
do*  
with  
Israel  <ARG1
.  

The  
Libyan  >ARG0
blowing  
up*  >>ARG0
of  
the  
Pan  
-  
Am  >ARGM-ADJ
flight*  
had*  
nothing  >ARG2
to  
do*  
with  
Israel  <ARG1
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
on  
and  
on  
and  
on  
.  

The  
root  >ARG1
of  
the  
trouble  
is*  
that  
this  
entire  
Moslem  
region  >>ARG1
is*  
totally  
dysfunctional  <ARG2
,  
by  
any  
standard  <ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
word  
,  
and  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
so  <ARG2
even  
if  
Israel  >>ARG0
had*  
joined*  
the  
Arab  
league  <ARG1
and  
an  
independent  
Palestine  >>ARG1
had*  
existed*  
for  
100  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
22  
member  
countries  >ARG0
of  
the  
Arab  
league  
,  
from  
Mauritania  
to  
the  
Gulf  
States  
,  
have*  
a  
total  >ARGM-ADJ
population*  
of  
300  
millions  <ARGM-ADJ
,  
larger  
than  
the  
US  
and  
almost  
as  
large  
as  
the  
EU  
before  
its  >ARG1
expansion*  
.  

They  >ARG0
have*  
a  
land  
area  <ARG1
larger  
than  
either  
the  
US  
or  
all  
of  
Europe  
.  

These  
22  
countries  >ARG0
,  
with  
all  
their  
oil  
and  
natural  
resources  
,  
have*  
a  
combined  
GDP  <ARG1
smaller  
than  
that  
of  
Netherlands  
plus  
Belgium  
and  
equal  
to  
half  
of  
the  
GDP  
of  
California  
alone  
.  

Within  
this  
meager  
GDP  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
gaps  >ARG1
between  
rich  
and  
poor  
are*  
beyond  
belief  <ARG2
and  
too  
many  >>ARG1
of  
the  
rich  
made*  
their  
money  <ARG1
not  
by  
succeeding*  
in  
business  <ARG1
,  
but  
by  
being*  
corrupt  
rulers  <ARG2
.  

The  
social  
status  >ARG1
of  
women  
is*  
far  
below  
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
was*  
in  
the  
Western  
World  <ARGM-LOC
150  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Human  >ARG1
rights*  >ARG1
are*  
below  
any  
reasonable  
standard  <ARG2
,  
in  
spite  <ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
grotesque  
fact  
that  
Libya  >>ARG1
was*  
elected*  
Chair  <ARG2
of  
the  
UN  
Human  
Rights  
commission  
.  

According  
to  
a  
report*  >>ARGM-ADV
prepared*  
by  
a  
committee  <ARG0
of  
Arab  
intellectuals  
and  
published*  
under  
the  
auspices  <ARG0
of  
the  
U.N.  
,  
the  
number  >>ARG1
of  
books  >ARG1
translated*  
by  
the  
entire  
Arab  
world  <ARG0
is*  
much  >ARGM-EXT
smaller*  
than  
what  >ARG1
little  
Greece  >ARG0
alone  
translates*  
.  

The  
total  
number  >>ARG1
of  
scientific  >ARGM-ADJ
publications*  
of  
300  
million  
Arabs  <ARG0
is*  
less*  
than  
that  <ARG2
of  
6  
million  
Israelis  
.  

Birth  
rates  >>ARG0
in  
the  
region  
are*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
high*  
,  
increasing*  
the  
poverty  <ARG1
,  
the  
social  
gaps  
and  
the  
cultural  
decline  
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
all  >>ARG1
of  
this  
is*  
happening*  
in  
a  
region  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
only  
30  
years  
ago  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
was*  
believed*  
to  
be*  
the  
next  
wealthy  
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
world  
,  
and  
in  
a  
Moslem  
area  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
developed*  
,  
at  
some  
point  <ARGM-TMP
in  
history  
,  
one  <ARG1
of  
the  
most  
advanced  
cultures  
in  
the  
world  
.  

It  
is*  
fair*  
to  
say*  
that  
this  >ARG0
creates*  
an  
unprecedented  
breeding  
ground  <ARG1
for  
cruel  
dictators  
,  
terror  
networks  
,  
fanaticism  
,  
incitement*  
,  
suicide  >ARG2
murders*  
and  
general  
decline  
.  

It  
is*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
a  
fact  <ARG2
that  
almost  
everybody  >ARG0
in  
the  
region  
blames*  
this  
situation  <ARG2
on  
the  
United  
States  <ARG1
,  
on  
Israel  
,  
on  
Western  >ARGM-LOC
Civilization*  
,  
on  
Judaism  
and  
Christianity  
,  
on  
anyone  
and  
anything  
,  
except  
themselves  
.  

A  
word  
about  
the  
millions  
of  
decent  
,  
honest  
,  
good  
people  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG1
are*  
either  
devout  
Moslems  <ARG2
or  
are*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
very  >ARGM-EXT
religious*  
but  
grew*  
up  
in  
Moslem  
families  <ARGM-MNR
:  
They  >ARG1
are*  
double  
victims  <ARG2
of  
an  
outside  
world  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
develops*  
Islamophobia  <ARG1
,  
and  
of  
their  
own  
environment  >ARG0
which  >R-ARG0
breaks*  
their  
heart  <ARG1
by  
being*  
totally  
dysfunctional  <ARG2
.  

The  
problem  >ARG1
is*  
that  
the  
vast  
silent  
majority  >ARG1
of  
these  
Moslems  
are*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
terror  
and  
the  
incitement*  
,  
but  
they  >>ARG1
also  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
stand*  
up  
against  
it  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG1
become*  
accomplices  <ARG2
,  
by  
omission*  
,  
and  
this  >ARG1
applies*  
to  
political  
leaders  <ARG2
,  
intellectuals  
,  
business  
people  
and  
many  
others  
.  

Many  >>ARG0
of  
them  
can  >ARGM-MOD
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
tell*  
right  <ARG1
from  
wrong  <ARG2
,  
but  
are*  
afraid*  
to  
express*  
their  >ARG0
views*  
.  

The  
events  >>ARG0
of  
the  
last  
few  
years  
have*  
amplified*  
four  
issues*  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
have*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
existed*  
,  
but  
have*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
been*  
as  
rampant  <ARG2
as  
in  
the  
present  >ARGM-TMP
upheaval*  
in  
the  
region  <ARGM-LOC
.  

A  
few  
more  
years  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
pass*  
before  
everybody  >ARG0
acknowledges*  
that  
it  >ARG1
is*  
a  
World  
War  <ARG2
,  
but  
we  >ARG1
are*  
already  <ARGM-TMP
well  
into  
it  <ARG2
.  

These  >ARG1
are*  
the  
four  
main  
pillars  <ARG2
of  
the  
current  >ARGM-TMP
World  >ARG0
Conflict*  
,  
or  
perhaps  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
already  >ARGM-TMP
refer*  
to  
it  <ARG1
as  
"  
the  
undeclared  
World  
War  
III  <ARG2
"  
:  

*  
1  
.  
The  
first  
element  >ARG1
is*  
the  
suicide  >ARG2
murder*  
.  
*  

Suicide  >ARG2
murders*  >ARG1
are*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
invention*  
but  
they  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
made*  
popular*  
,  
if  
I  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
use*  
this  
expression*  
,  
only  <<ARGM-TMP
lately  
.  

Even  
after  
September  >ARGM-TMP
11  
,  
it  
seems*  
that  
most  >>ARG0
of  
the  
Western  
World  
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
yet  >ARGM-TMP
understand*  
this  
weapon  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
a  
very  
potent  
psychological  
weapon  <ARG2
.  

Its  >ARG0
real  >ARGM-ADJ
direct  >ARGM-ADJ
impact*  >>ARG1
is*  
relatively  >ARGM-ADV
minor*  
.  

The  
total  
number  >>ARG1
of  
casualties  
from  
hundreds  
of  
suicide  >ARG2
murders*  
within  
Israel  <ARGM-LOC
in  
the  
last  
three  
years  <ARGM-TMP
is*  
much  >ARGM-EXT
smaller*  
than  
those  <ARGM-CXN
due  
to  
car  
accidents  
.  

September  >ARG1
11  
was*  
quantitatively  <ARGM-ADV
much  
less  
lethal  <ARG2
than  
many  >ARGM-ADJ
earthquakes*  

More  
people  >ARG1
die*  
from  
AIDS  <ARGM-CAU
in  
one  
day  <ARGM-TMP
in  
Africa  <ARGM-LOC
than  
all  
the  
Russians  >ARG1
who  >R-ARG1
died*  
in  
the  
hands  <ARGM-LOC
of  
Chechnya  >ARGM-LOC
-  
based*  
Moslem  
suicide  
murderers  <ARG1
since  
that  
conflict*  >ARG1
started*  
.  

Saddam  >ARG0
killed*  
every  
month  <ARGM-TMP
more  
people  <ARG1
than  
all  
those  >ARG1
who  >R-ARG1
died*  
from  
suicide  >ARG2
murders*  
since  
the  
Coalition  >ARG0
occupation*  
of  
Iraq  <ARG1
.  

So  
what  >ARG1
is*  
all  
the  
fuss  <ARG2
about  
suicide  >ARGM-ADJ
killings*  
?  

It  >ARG0
creates*  
headlines  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
spectacular  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
frightening  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
a  
very  
cruel  >ARGM-ADJ
death*  
with  
bodies  >ARG1
dismembered*  
and  
horrible  >ARGM-ADJ
severe  >ARGM-ADJ
lifelong  >ARGM-ADJ
injuries*  
to  
many  <ARG1
of  
the  
wounded  
.  

It  >>ARG1
is*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
shown*  
on  
television  <ARGM-LOC
in  
great  
detail  <ARGM-MNR
.  

One  
such  >ARGM-ADJ
murder*  >>ARG0
,  
with  
the  
help*  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
hysterical  >ARGM-ADJ
media  >ARG0
coverage*  
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
destroy*  
the  
tourism  
industry  <ARG1
of  
a  
country  
for  
quite  
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
,  
as  
it  
did*  
in  
Bali  <<ARGM-PRD
and  
in  
Turkey  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
real  >ARGM-ADJ
fear*  >ARG1
comes*  
from  
the  
undisputed  
fact  <ARG2
that  
no  >ARGM-NEG
defense*  >>ARG0
and  
no  >ARGM-NEG
preventive  >ARG1
measures*  
can  >ARGM-MOD
succeed*  
against  
a  
determined  
suicide  
murderer  <ARG1
.  

This  >>ARG0
has*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
yet  >ARGM-TMP
penetrated*  
the  
thinking*  
of  
the  
Western  
World  <ARG0
.  

The  
U.S.  >>ARG0
and  
Europe  
are*  
constantly  >ARGM-TMP
improving*  
their  >ARG0
defense*  
against  
the  
last  >ARGM-TMP
murder*  
,  
not  
the  
next  
one  
.  

We  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
arrange*  
for  
the  
best  
airport  
security  <ARG1
in  
the  
world  
.  

But  
if  
you  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
murder*  
by  
suicide  <ARG2
,  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
not  
have*  
to  
board*  
a  
plane  <ARG1
in  
order  
to  
explode*  
yourself  <ARG1
and  
kill*  
many  
people  <ARG1
.  

Who  >>ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
stop*  
a  
suicide  >ARG2
murder*  
in  
the  
midst  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
crowded  
line  >ARG1
waiting*  
to  
be*  
checked*  
by  
the  
airport  
metal  
detector  <ARG0
?  

How  
about  
the  
lines  
to  
the  
check  
-  
in  
counters  
in  
a  
busy  
travel  
period  
?  

Put*  
a  
metal  
detector  <ARG1
in  
front  <ARG2
of  
every  
train  
station  
in  
Spain  
and  
the  
terrorists  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
the  
buses  <ARG1
.  

Protect*  
the  
buses  <ARG1
and  
they  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
explode*  
in  
movie  
theaters  <ARGM-LOC
,  
concert  
halls  
,  
supermarkets  
,  
shopping  
malls  
,  
schools  
and  
hospitals  
.  

Put*  
guards  <ARG1
in  
front  <ARG2
of  
every  
concert  
hall  
and  
there  
will  >ARGM-MOD
always  >ARGM-TMP
be*  
a  
line  >>ARG1
of  
people  
to  
be*  
checked*  
by  
the  
guards  <ARG0
and  
this  
line  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
target  <ARG2
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
speak*  
of  
killing*  
the  
guards  <ARG1
themselves  
.  

You  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
somewhat  >ARGM-EXT
reduce*  
your  
vulnerability  <ARG1
by  
preventive  >ARG1
and  
defensive  
measures*  
and  
by  
strict  >ARGM-MNR
border  >ARG1
controls*  
but  
not  >ARGM-NEG
eliminate*  
it  <ARG1
and  
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG
win*  
the  
war*  
in  
a  
defensive  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
it  >ARG1
is*  
a  
war*  
!  

What  >ARG1
is*  
behind  
the  
suicide  >ARG2
murders*  
?  

Money  >ARG1
is*  
,  
money  <C-ARG1
and  
power  
and  
cold  
-  
blooded  >ARGM-ADJ
murderous  >ARGM-ADJ
incitement*  
,  
nothing  
else  
.  

It  >ARG0
has*  
nothing  >ARG2
to  
do*  
with  
true  
fanatic  
religious  
beliefs  <ARG1
.  

No  
Moslem  
preacher  >>ARG0
has*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
blown*  
himself  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

No  
son  >>ARG0
of  
an  
Arab  
politician  
or  
religious  
leader  
has*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
blown*  
himself  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

No  
relative  >>ARG0
of  
anyone  
influential  
has*  
done*  
it  <ARG1
.  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
you  >ARG0
expect*  
some  >>ARG0
of  
the  
religious  
leaders  
to  
do*  
it  <ARG1
themselves  <ARGM-REC
,  
or  
to  
talk*  
their  
sons  <ARG1
into  
doing*  
it  <ARG1
,  
if  
this  >ARG1
is*  
truly  <ARGM-ADV
a  
supreme  
act  <ARG2
of  
religious  
fervor  
?  

Are*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
they  >ARG1
interested*  
in  
the  
benefits*  
of  
going*  
to  
Heaven  <ARG4
?  

Instead  >ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >ARG0
send*  
outcast  
women  <ARG1
,  
naive  
children  
,  
retarded  
people  
and  
young  
incited*  
hotheads  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
promise*  
them  <ARG1
the  
delights  <ARG2
,  
mostly  
sexual  
,  
of  
the  
next  
world  
,  
and  
pay*  
their  
families  <ARG2
handsomely  <ARGM-MNR
after  
the  
supreme  
act  >>ARG1
is*  
performed*  
and  
enough  
innocent  
people  >ARG1
are*  
dead  <ARG2
.  

Suicide  >ARG2
murders*  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
have*  
nothing  >ARG2
to  
do*  
with  
poverty  <ARG1
and  
despair  
.  

The  
poorest  
region  >ARG1
in  
the  
world  
,  
by  
far  >ARGM-EXT
,  
is*  
Africa  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
happens*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

There  
are*  
numerous  
desperate  
people  <ARG1
in  
the  
world  <ARGM-LOC
,  
in  
different  
cultures  <ARGM-LOC
,  
countries  
and  
continents  
.  

Desperation  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
provide*  
anyone  <ARG2
with  
explosives  <ARG1
,  
reconnaissance*  
and  
transportation*  
.  

There  
was*  
certainly  <ARGM-ADV
more  
despair  <ARG1
in  
Saddam  
's  
Iraq  
than  
in  
Paul  
Bremmer  
's  
Iraq  
,  
and  
no  
one  >ARG0
exploded*  
himself  <ARG1
.  

A  
suicide  >ARG2
murder*  >ARG1
is*  
simply  <ARGM-ADV
a  
horrible  
,  
vicious  
weapon  <ARG2
of  
cruel  
,  
inhuman  
,  
cynical  
,  
well  
-  
funded  
terrorists  
,  
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
regard*  
to  
human  
life  <ARG1
,  
including  
the  
life  
of  
their  
fellow  
countrymen  
,  
but  
with  
very  
high  >ARGM-ADJ
regard*  
to  
their  >ARG1
own  >ARGM-GOL
affluent  >ARGM-MNR
well  >ARGM-MNR
-  
being*  
and  
their  
hunger  
for  
power  
.  

The  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  >>ARG1
to  
fight*  
this  
new  
"  
popular  
"  
weapon  <ARG1
is*  
identical*  
to  
the  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  >ARGM-MNR
in  
which  >R-ARGM-MNR
you  >ARG0
fight*  
organized  
crime  <ARG1
or  
pirates  
on  
the  
high  
seas  
:  
the  
offensive  >ARGM-MNR
way*  
.  

Like  
in  
the  
case*  >ARGM-MNR
of  
organized  
crime  <ARG1
,  
it  
is*  
crucial  <ARG2
that  
the  
forces  >ARG1
on  
the  
offensive  
be*  
united  <ARG2
and  
it  
is*  
crucial  <ARG2
to  
reach*  
the  
top  <ARG1
of  
the  
crime  
pyramid  
.  

You  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
eliminate*  
organized  
crime  <ARG1
by  
arresting*  
the  
little  
drug  
dealer  <ARG1
on  
the  
street  
corner  
.  

You  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
after  
the  
head  <ARG1
of  
the  
"  
Family  
"  
.  

If  
part  >ARG0
of  
the  
public  
supports*  >>ARGM-ADV
it  <ARG1
,  
others  >ARG0
tolerate*  
it  <ARG1
,  
many  >>ARG0
are*  
afraid*  
of  
it  <ARG1
and  
some  >>ARG0
try*  
to  
explain*  
it  <ARG1
away  <ARGM-PRD
by  
poverty  <ARGM-MNR
or  
by  
a  
miserable  
childhood  
,  
organized  
crime  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
thrive*  
and  
so  
will  
terrorism  
.  

The  
United  
States  >ARG0
understands*  
this  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
after  
September  <ARGM-TMP
11  
.  

Russia  >>ARG0
is*  
beginning*  
to  
understand*  
it  <ARG1
.  

Turkey  >ARG0
understands*  
it  <ARG1
well  <ARGM-EXT
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
very  
much  >ARGM-EXT
afraid*  
that  
most  >>ARG0
of  
Europe  
still  >>ARGM-TMP
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
understand*  
it  <ARG1
.  

Unfortunately  >ARGM-ADV
,  
it  
seems*  
that  
Europe  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
understand*  
it  <ARG1
only  
after  
suicide  >ARG2
murders*  >ARG1
arrive*  
in  
Europe  <ARG4
in  
a  
big  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  
.  

In  
my  
humble  
opinion  >ARGM-ADV
,  
this  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
happen*  
.  

The  
Spanish  
trains  >>ARG1
and  
the  
Istanbul  >ARG1
bombings*  
are*  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
the  
beginning*  
.  

The  
unity  >>ARG1
of  
the  
Civilized  
World  
in  
fighting*  
this  
horror  <ARG1
is*  
absolutely  >ARGM-EXT
indispensable*  
.  

Until  
Europe  >ARG1
wakes*  >>ARGM-TMP
up  
,  
this  
unity  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
achieved*  
.  

*  
2  
.  
The  
second  
ingredient  >ARG1
is*  
words  <ARG2
,  
more  
precisely  >ARGM-ADJ
lies*  
.  
*  

Words  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
lethal  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG0
kill*  
people  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
is*  
often  >ARGM-TMP
said*  
that  
politicians  >ARG0
,  
diplomats  
and  
perhaps  
also  
lawyers  
and  
business  
people  
must  >ARGM-MOD
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
lie*  
,  
as  
part  <ARGM-ADV
of  
their  
professional  
life  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
norms  >>ARG1
of  
politics  
and  
diplomacy  
are*  
childish*  
,  
in  
comparison*  
with  
the  
level  <ARG2
of  
incitement*  >>ARG0
and  
total  >ARGM-ADJ
absolute  >ARGM-ADJ
deliberate  >ARGM-ADJ
fabrications*  
,  
which  >>R-ARG0
have*  
reached*  
new  
heights  <ARG1
in  
the  
region  >>ARG1
we  >>ARG0
are*  
talking*  
about  <C-ARG1
.  

An  
incredible  
number  >ARG0
of  
people  
in  
the  
Arab  
world  
believe*  
that  
September  >>ARG1
11  
never  >ARGM-NEG
happened*  
,  
or  
was*  
an  
American  >ARG0
provocation*  
or  
,  
even  
better  
,  
a  
Jewish  >ARG0
plot*  
.  

You  >ARG0
all  
remember*  
the  
Iraqi  
Minister  <ARG1
of  
Information  
,  
Mr.  
Mouhamad  
Said  
al  
-  
Sahaf  
and  
his  >ARG0
press  >ARG1
conferences*  >ARGM-TMP
when  >R-ARGM-TMP
the  
US  
forces  >ARG1
were*  
already  <ARGM-TMP
inside  
Baghdad  <ARG2
.  

Disinformation  >>ARG1
at  
time  
of  
war*  
is*  
an  
accepted  
tactic  <ARG2
.  

But  
to  
stand*  >>ARG1
,  
day  <ARGM-TMP
after  
day  
,  
and  
to  
make*  >ARGM-LVB
such  >ARGM-ADJ
preposterous  >ARGM-ADJ
statements*  
,  
known  <ARGM-ADJ
to  
everybody  
to  
be*  
lies*  
,  
without  
even  >>ARGM-ADV
being*  
ridiculed*  
in  
your  
own  
milieu  <ARGM-LOC
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
happen*  
in  
this  
region  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Mr.  >ARG1
Sahaf  
eventually  >ARGM-TMP
became*  
a  
popular  
icon  <ARG2
as  
a  
court  
jester  <ARGM-PRD
,  
but  
this  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
stop*  
some  
allegedly  
respectable  
newspapers  <ARG1
from  
giving*  
him  <ARG2
equal  
time  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-DIS
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
prevent*  
the  
Western  
press  <ARG1
from  
giving*  
credence  <ARG1
,  
every  
day  <ARGM-TMP
,  
even  
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
to  
similar  
liars  <ARG2
.  

After  
all  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
you  >>ARG1
want*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
be*  
an  
anti-Semite  <ARG2
,  
there  
are*  
subtle  >ARGM-MNR
ways*  
of  
doing*  
it  <ARG1
.  

You  >>ARG0
do*  
not  
have*  
to  
claim*  
that  
the  
holocaust  >ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
happened*  
,  
and  
that  
the  
Jewish  
temple  >ARG1
in  
Jerusalem  
never  >ARGM-NEG
existed*  
.  

But  
millions  >>ARG2
of  
Moslems  
are*  
told*  
by  
their  
leaders  <ARG0
that  
this  >ARG1
is*  
the  
case*  
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
these  
same  
leaders  >>ARG0
make*  >>ARGM-TMP
other  >ARGM-ADJ
statements*  
,  
the  
Western  
media  >ARG0
report*  
them  <ARG1
as  
if  
they  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
true*  
.  

It  
is*  
a  
daily  
occurrence  <ARG2
that  
the  
same  
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
finance*  
,  
arm*  
and  
dispatch*  
suicide  
murderers  <ARG1
,  
condemn*  
the  
act  <ARG1
in  
English  <ARGM-MNR
in  
front  <ARGM-LOC
of  
western  
TV  
cameras  
,  
talking*  
to  
a  
world  
audience  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
even  
partly  >ARGM-EXT
believes*  
them  <ARG1
.  

It  
is*  
a  
daily  
routine  <ARG2
to  
hear*  
the  
same  
leader  >>ARG0
making*  >ARGM-LVB
opposite  >ARGM-ADJ
statements*  
in  
Arabic  <ARGM-MNR
to  
his  
people  <ARG3
and  
in  
English  
to  
the  
rest  
of  
the  
world  
.  

Incitement*  >>ARG1
by  
Arab  
TV  <ARG0
,  
accompanied*  
by  
horror  
pictures  <ARG0
of  
mutilated*  
bodies  <ARG1
,  
has*  
become*  
a  
powerful  
weapon  <ARG2
of  
those  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
lie*  
,  
distort*  
and  
want*  
to  
destroy*  
everything  <ARG1
.  

Little  
children  >>ARG1
are*  
raised*  
on  
deep  
hatred  <ARGM-MNR
and  
on  
admiration  
of  
so  
-  
called  
martyrs  
,  
and  
the  
Western  
World  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
notice*  
it  <ARG1
because  
its  
own  
TV  
sets  >>ARG1
are*  
mostly  >ARGM-ADV
tuned*  
to  
soap  
operas  <ARG2
and  
game  >ARG1
shows*  
.  

I  >ARG0
recommend*  
to  
you  <ARG2
,  
even  
though  
most  >>ARG0
of  
you  
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
understand*  
Arabic  <ARG1
,  
to  
watch*  
Al  
Jazeera  <ARG1
,  
from  
time  <ARGM-TMP
to  
time  
.  

You  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
believe*  
your  
own  
eyes  <ARG1
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
words  >ARG1
also  >ARGM-DIS
work*  
in  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
ways*  
,  
more  
subtle  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

A  
demonstration*  >>ARG1
in  
Berlin  <ARGM-LOC
,  
carrying*  
banners  >>ARG0
supporting*  
Saddam  
's  
regime  <ARG1
and  
featuring*  
three  
-  
year  
old  
babies  >ARG1
dressed*  
as  
suicide  
murderers  <ARG2
,  
is*  
defined*  
by  
the  
press  <ARG0
and  
by  
political  
leaders  
as  
a  
"  
peace  >ARG1
demonstration*  
"  
.  

You  >>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
support*  
or  
oppose*  
the  
Iraq  >ARG1
war*  
,  
but  
to  
refer*  >>ARG1
to  
fans  <ARG1
of  
Saddam  
,  
Arafat  
or  
Bin  
Laden  
as  
peace  
activists  <ARG2
is*  
a  
bit  >ARGM-EXT
too  >ARGM-EXT
much*  
.  

A  
woman  >>ARG0
walks*  
into  
an  
Israeli  
restaurant  <ARG2
in  
mid-day  <ARGM-TMP
,  
eats*  
,  
observes*  
families  >ARG0
with  
old  
people  
and  
children  
eating*  
their  
lunch  <ARG1
in  
the  
adjacent  
tables  <ARGM-LOC
and  
pays*  
the  
bill  <ARG2
.  

She  >>ARG0
then  >ARGM-TMP
blows*  
herself  <ARG1
up  <C-V
,  
killing*  
20  
people  <ARG1
,  
including  
many  
children  
,  
with  
heads  >ARG1
and  
arms  
rolling*  
around  <ARGM-DIR
in  
the  
restaurant  <ARG2
.  

She  >>ARG1
is*  
called*  
"  
martyr  <ARG2
"  
by  
several  
Arab  
leaders  <ARG0
and  
"  
activist  
"  
by  
the  
European  
press  
.  

Dignitaries  >>ARG0
condemn*  
the  
act  <ARG1
but  
visit*  
her  
bereaved  
family  <ARG1
and  
the  
money  >ARG1
flows*  
.  

There  
is*  
a  
new  
game  <ARG1
in  
town  <ARGM-LOC
:  
The  
actual  
murderer  >>ARG1
is*  
called*  
"  
the  
military  
wing  <ARG2
"  
,  
the  
one  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG0
pays*  
him  <ARG2
,  
equips*  
him  <ARG1
and  
sends*  
him  <ARG1
is*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
called*  
"  
the  
political  
wing  <ARG2
"  
and  
the  
head  >>ARG1
of  
the  
operation*  
is*  
called*  
the  
"  
spiritual  
leader  <ARG2
"  
.  

There  
are*  
numerous  
other  
examples  <ARG1
of  
such  
Orwellian  
nomenclature  >ARG1
,  
used*  
every  
day  <ARGM-TMP
not  
only  
by  
terror  
chiefs  <ARG0
but  
also  
by  
Western  
media  
.  

These  
words  >>ARG0
are*  
much  
more  >ARGM-CXN
dangerous*  
than  
many  
people  >ARG0
realize*  
.  

They  >ARG0
provide*  
an  
emotional  
infrastructure  <ARG1
for  
atrocities  
.  

It  
was*  
Joseph  >ARG0
Goebbels  
who  >R-ARG0
said*  
that  
if  
you  >ARG0
repeat*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
lie*  
often  
enough  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
people  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
believe*  
it  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG1
is*  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
being*  
outperformed*  
by  
his  
successors  <ARG0
.  

*  
3  
.  
The  
third  
aspect  >ARG1
is*  
money  <ARG2
.  
*  

Huge  
amounts  >>ARG1
of  
money  
,  
which  >>R-ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
solved*  
many  
social  
problems  <ARG1
in  
this  
dysfunctional  
part  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
world  
,  
are*  
channeled*  
into  
three  
concentric  
spheres  >ARG0
supporting*  
death*  
and  
murder*  
.  

In  
the  
inner  
circle  >ARG2
are*  
the  
terrorists  <ARG1
themselves  
.  

The  
money  >ARG2
funds*  
their  >>ARG0
travel*  
,  
explosives  
,  
hideouts  
and  
permanent  >ARGM-TMP
search*  
for  
soft  
vulnerable  
targets  <ARG2
.  

The  
inner  
circles  >>ARG1
are*  
primarily  >ARGM-ADV
financed*  
by  
terrorist  
states  <ARG0
like  
Iran  
and  
Syria  
,  
until  
recently  
also  
by  
Iraq  
and  
Libya  
and  
earlier  
also  
by  
some  
of  
the  
Communist  
regimes  
.  

These  
states  >ARG1
,  
as  
well  
as  
the  
Palestinian  
Authority  
,  
are*  
the  
safe  
havens  <ARG2
of  
the  
wholesale  
murder  
vendors  
.  

They  >>ARG2
are*  
surrounded*  
by  
a  
second  
wider  
circle  <ARG1
of  
direct  
supporters  >ARG0
,  
planners  
,  
commanders  
,  
preachers  
,  
all  >R-ARG0
of  
whom  
make*  
a  
living*  
,  
usually  >ARGM-TMP
a  
very  
comfortable  >ARGM-ADJ
living*  
,  
by  
serving*  
as  
terror  
infrastructure  <ARG1
.  

Finally  >ARGM-TMP
,  
we  >ARG0
find*  
the  
third  
circle  >>ARG0
of  
so  
-  
called  
religious  
,  
educational  
and  
welfare  
organizations  
,  
which  >>R-ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
do*  
some  
good  <ARG1
,  
feed*  
the  
hungry  <ARG1
and  
provide*  
some  
schooling*  
,  
but  
brainwash*  
a  
new  
generation  <ARG1
with  
hatred  <ARGM-MNR
,  
lies*  
and  
ignorance  
.  

This  
circle  >ARG1
operates*  
mostly  
through  
mosques  <ARGM-MNR
,  
madrasas  
and  
other  
religious  
establishments  
but  
also  
through  
inciting*  
electronic  
and  
printed  
media  <ARG1
.  

It  
is*  
this  
circle  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
makes*  
sure*  
that  
women  >>ARG1
remain*  
inferior*  
,  
that  
democracy  >ARG1
is*  
unthinkable  <ARG2
and  
that  
exposure*  >>ARG1
to  
the  
outside  
world  <ARG2
is*  
minimal*  
.  

It  
is*  
also  <ARGM-DIS
that  
circle  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
leads*  
the  
way*  
in  
blaming*  
everybody  <ARG1
outside  
the  
Moslem  
world  
,  
for  
the  
miseries  <ARG2
of  
the  
region  
.  

The  
outer  
circle  >>ARG1
is*  
largely  >ARGM-EXT
financed*  
by  
Saudi  
Arabia  <ARG0
,  
but  
also  
by  
donations*  
from  
certain  
Moslem  
communities  <ARG0
in  
the  
United  
States  
and  
Europe  
and  
,  
to  
a  
smaller  
extent  
,  
by  
donations*  
of  
European  
Governments  <ARG0
to  
various  
NGO's  <ARG2
and  
by  
certain  
United  
Nations  
organizations  >>ARG1
,  
whose  
goals  >>R-ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
noble*  
,  
but  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
infested*  
and  
exploited*  
by  
agents  <ARG0
of  
the  
outer  
circle  
.  

The  
Saudi  
regime  >ARG1
,  
of  >ARGM-ADV
course  
,  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
next  
victim  <ARG2
of  
major  
terror  
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
inner  
circle  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
explode*  
into  
the  
outer  
circle  <ARGM-GOL
.  

The  
Saudis  >>ARG0
are*  
beginning*  
to  
understand*  
it  <ARG1
,  
but  
they  >>ARG0
fight*  
the  
inner  
circles  <ARG1
,  
while  
still  >ARGM-TMP
financing*  
the  
infrastructure  <ARG1
at  
the  
outer  
circle  
.  

Figuratively  >ARGM-MNR
speaking*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
this  
outer  
circle  >ARG1
is*  
the  
guardian  >>ARG0
,  
which  >>R-ARG0
makes*  
sure*  
that  
the  
people  >>ARG0
look*  
and  
listen*  
inwards  
to  
the  
inner  
circle  <ARG1
of  
terror  
and  
incitement*  
,  
rather  
than  
to  
the  
world  
outside  
.  

Some  
parts  >ARG1
of  
this  
same  
outer  
circle  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
operate*  
as  
a  
result  <ARGM-CAU
of  
fear*  
from  <ARG1
,  
or  
blackmail  
by  
,  
the  
inner  
circles  <C-ARG1
.  

The  
horrifying  
added  
factor  >ARG1
is*  
the  
high  
birth  
rate  <ARG2
.  

Half  >>ARG1
of  
the  
population*  
of  
the  
Arab  
world  <ARG1
is*  
under  
the  
age  <ARG2
of  
20  
,  
the  
most  
receptive  
age  
to  
incitement*  
,  
guaranteeing*  
two  
more  
generations  <ARG1
of  
blind  
hatred  
.  

Some  >ARG0
of  
the  
leaders  
of  
these  
various  
circles  
live*  
very  
comfortably  <ARGM-MNR
on  
their  
loot  <ARGM-LOC
.  

You  >ARG0
meet*  
their  
children  <ARG1
in  
the  
best  
private  
schools  
in  
Europe  
,  
not  
in  
the  
training  
camps  
of  
suicide  
murderers  
.

some  >ARG0
of

ski*  
in  
Switzerland  <ARGM-LOC

Mrs.  >>ARG0
Arafat  
,  
who  >R-ARG0
lives*  
in  
Paris  <ARGM-LOC
with  
her  
daughter  <ARGM-COM

receives*  
tens  <ARG1
of  
thousands  
of  
dollars  
per  
month  <ARGM-TMP
from  
the  
allegedly  
bankrupt  
Palestinian

while  
a  
typical  
local  
ringleader  >>ARG0
of  
the  
Al

Aksa  
brigade  
,  
reporting*  
to  
Arafat  <ARG2
,  
receives*  
only  
a  
cash  >ARGM-MNR
payment*  
of  
a  
couple  
of  
hundred  
dollars  <ARG1
,  
for  
performing*  >ARGM-LVB
murders*  
at  
the  
retail  
level  
.

.  
The  
fourth  
element  >>ARG1
of  
the  
current  >ARGM-TMP
world  >ARG0
conflict*  
is*  
the  
total  >ARGM-EXT
breaking*  
of  
all  
laws  <ARG1
.  
*  

The  
civilized  
world  >ARG0
believes*  
in  
democracy  <ARG1
,  
the  
rule*  
of  
law  <ARG1
,  
including  
international  
law  <ARGM-ADJ
,  
human  >ARG1
rights*  
,  
free  >ARGM-ADJ
speech*  
and  
free  
press  
,  
among  
other  
liberties  
.  

There  
are*  
naive  
old  
-  
fashioned  
habits  <ARG1
such  
as  
respecting*  
religious  
sites  <ARG1
and  
symbols  
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
using*  
ambulances  <ARG1
and  
hospitals  
for  
acts  <ARG2
of  
war*  
,  
avoiding*  
the  
mutilation*  
of  
dead  
bodies  <ARG1
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
using*  
children  <ARG1
as  
human  
shields  <ARG2
or  
human  
bombs  
.  

Never  
in  
history  
,  
not  
even  
in  
the  
Nazi  
period  
,  
was  
there  
such  
total  
disregard  
of  
all  
of  
the  
above  
as  
we  >ARG0
observe*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Every  
student  >ARG0
of  
political  
science  
debates*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
you  >ARG0
prevent*  
an  
anti-democratic  
force  >>ARG0
from  
winning*  
a  
democratic  >ARGM-MNR
election*  
and  
abolishing*  
democracy  <ARG1
.  

Other  
aspects  >>ARG1
of  
a  
civilized  
society  
must  >>ARGM-MOD
also  >>ARGM-DIS
have*  >ARGM-LVB
limitations*  
.  

Can  >>ARGM-MOD
a  
policeman  >>ARG0
open*  >ARGM-LVB
fire*  
on  
someone  >ARG0
trying*  
to  
kill*  
him  <ARG1
?  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
a  
government  >ARG0
listen*  
to  
phone  >ARGM-MNR
conversations*  
of  
terrorists  <ARG0
and  
drug  
dealers  
?  

Does*  
free  >ARGM-ADJ
speech*  >ARG0
protect*  
you  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
shout*  
"  
fire*  
"  
in  
a  
crowded  
theater  <<ARGM-LOC
?  

Should  >ARGM-MOD
there  
be*  
death  
penalty  <ARG1
,  
for  
deliberate  >ARGM-ADJ
multiple  >ARGM-ADJ
murders*  
?  

These  >ARG1
are*  
the  
old  
-  
fashioned  
dilemmas  <ARG2
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
now  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
have*  
an  
entire  
new  
set  <ARG1
.  

Do*  
you  >ARG0
raid*  
a  
mosque  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
serves*  
as  
a  
terrorist  >ARG0
ammunition  >ARG1
storage*  
?  

Do*  
you  >>ARG0
return*  
fire*  
,  
if  
you  >>ARG1
are*  
attacked*  
from  
a  
hospital  <ARGM-DIR
?  

Do*  
you  >ARG0
storm*  
a  
church  >ARG1
taken*  
over  
by  
terrorists  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
took*  
the  
priests  <ARG2
hostages  <ARG2
?  

Do*  
you  >ARG0
search*  
every  
ambulance  <ARG1
after  
a  
few  
suicide  
murderers  >>ARG0
use*  
ambulances  <ARG1
to  
reach*  
their  
targets  <ARG1
?  

Do*  
you  >ARG0
strip*  
every  
woman  <ARG2
because  
one  >>ARG0
pretended*  
to  
be*  
pregnant*  
and  
carried*  
a  
suicide  
bomb  <ARG1
on  
her  
belly  <ARGM-LOC
?  

Do*  
you  >ARG0
shoot*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
at  
someone  >>ARG1
trying*  
to  
kill*  
you  <ARG1
,  
standing*  
deliberately  <ARGM-MNR
behind  
a  
group  <ARG2
of  
children  
?  

Do*  
you  >ARG0
raid*  
terrorist  
headquarters  >ARG1
,  
hidden*  
in  
a  
mental  
hospital  <ARGM-LOC
?  

Do*  
you  >ARG0
shoot*  
an  
arch-murderer  >>ARG2
who  >>R-ARG2
deliberately  >ARGM-MNR
moves*  
from  
one  
location  <ARGM-DIR
to  
another  <ARG2
,  
always  >ARGM-TMP
surrounded*  
by  
children  <ARG1
?  

All  >ARG1
of  
these  
happen*  
daily  <ARGM-TMP
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
and  
in  
the  
Palestinian  
areas  
.  

What  >>ARG1
do*  
you  >ARG0
do*  
?  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
face*  
the  
dilemma  <ARG1
.  

But  
it  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
avoided*  
.  

Suppose*  
,  
for  
the  
sake  <ARGM-PRP
of  
discussion*  
,  
that  
someone  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
openly  >ARGM-MNR
stay*  
in  
a  
well  
-  
known  
address  <ARG3
in  
Teheran  
,  
hosted*  
by  
the  
Iranian  
Government  <ARG0
and  
financed*  
by  
it  <ARG0
,  
executing*  
one  
atrocity  <ARG1
after  
another  
in  
Spain  <ARGM-LOC
or  
in  
France  
,  
killing*  
hundreds  <ARG1
of  
innocent  
people  
,  
accepting*  
responsibility  <ARG1
for  
the  
crimes  
,  
promising*  
in  
public  >ARGM-ADJ
TV  >ARGM-MNR
interviews*  
to  
do*  
more  <ARG1
of  
the  
same  
,  
while  
the  
Government  >>ARG0
of  
Iran  
issues*  
public  
condemnations  <ARG1
of  
his  
acts  
but  
continues*  
to  
host*  
him  <ARG1
,  
invite*  
him  <ARG1
to  
official  >ARGM-ADJ
functions*  
and  
treat*  
him  <ARG1
as  
a  
great  
dignitary  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
leave*  
it  <ARG1
to  
you  <ARG1
as  
homework*  
to  
figure*  
out  
what  >>ARG1
Spain  >>ARG0
or  
France  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
done*  
,  
in  
such  
a  
situation  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
problem  >ARG1
is*  
that  
the  
civilized  
world  >>ARG0
is*  
still  >>ARGM-TMP
having*  
illusions*  
about  
the  
rule*  
of  
law  <ARG1
in  
a  
totally  
lawless  
environment  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

It  >>ARG0
is*  
trying*  
to  
play*  
ice  
hockey  <ARG1
by  
sending*  
a  
ballerina  
ice  
-  
skater  <ARG1
into  
the  
ring  <ARG2
or  
to  
knock*  
out  
a  
heavyweight  
boxer  <ARG1
by  
a  
chess  
player  <ARG2
.  

In  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  >>ARGM-MNR
that  >R-ARGM-MNR
no  
country  >ARG0
has*  
a  
law  <ARG1
against  
cannibals  >ARG0
eating*  
its  
prime  
minister  <ARG1
,  
because  
such  
an  
act  >ARG1
is*  
unthinkable  <ARG2
,  
international  
law  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
address*  
killers  >ARG0
shooting*  
from  
hospitals  <ARGM-LOC
,  
mosques  
and  
ambulances  
,  
while  
being*  
protected*  
by  
their  
Government  <ARG0
or  
society  
.  

International  
law  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
handle*  
someone  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG1
sends*  
children  >ARG0
to  
throw*  
stones  <ARG1
,  
stands*  
behind  
them  <ARG2
and  
shoots*  
with  
immunity  <ARGM-MNR
and  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
arrested*  
because  
he  >>ARG1
is*  
sheltered*  
by  
a  
Government  <ARG0
.  

International  
law  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
deal*  
with  
a  
leader  >>ARG1
of  
murderers  
who  >>R-ARG1
is*  
royally  >ARGM-MNR
and  
comfortably  
hosted*  
by  
a  
country  >>ARG0
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
pretends*  
to  
condemn*  
his  
acts  <ARG1
or  
just  >ARGM-ADV
claims*  
to  
be*  
too  >ARGM-EXT
weak*  
to  
arrest*  
him  <ARG1
.  

The  
amazing  
thing  >ARG1
is*  
that  
all  >>ARG0
of  
these  
crooks  
demand*  
protection*  
under  
international  
law  <<ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
define*  
all  
those  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
attack*  
them  <ARG1
as  
"  
war  
criminals  <<ARG2
,  
"  
with  
some  
Western  
media  >ARG0
repeating*  
the  
allegations*  
.  

The  
good  
news  >ARG1
is*  
that  
all  >ARG1
of  
this  
is*  
temporary  <ARG2
,  
because  
the  
evolution*  >>ARG0
of  
international  
law  <ARG1
has*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
adapted*  
itself  <ARG1
to  
reality  <ARG2
.  

The  
punishment*  >>ARG1
for  
suicide  >ARG2
murder*  
should  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
death*  
or  
arrest*  
before  
the  
murder*  
,  
not  
during  
and  
not  
after  
.  

After  
every  
world  >ARG0
war*  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
rules*  >>ARG1
of  
international  
law  <ARG1
have*  
changed*  
,  
and  
the  
same  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
happen*  
after  
the  
present  
one  <ARGM-TMP
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
during  
the  
twilight  
zone  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
a  
lot  >>ARG1
of  
harm*  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
done*  
.  

The  
picture  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
described*  
here  <ARGM-LOC
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
pretty  <ARG2
.  

What  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
we  >ARG0
do*  
about  
it  <ARG2
?  

In  
the  
short  >ARGM-ADJ
run*  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
only  >>ARGM-ADV
fight*  
and  
win*  
.  

In  
the  
long  >ARGM-ADJ
run*  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
only  >>ARGM-ADV
educate*  
the  
next  
generation  <ARG1
and  
open*  
it  <ARG1
to  
the  
world  <ARG3
.  

The  
inner  
circles  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
and  
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
destroyed*  
by  
force  <ARG2
.  

The  
outer  
circle  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
eliminated*  
by  
force  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Here  >ARGM-LOC
we  >ARG0
need*  
financial  >ARG2
starvation*  
of  
the  
organizing  
elite  <ARG1
,  
more  
power  
to  
women  
,  
more  >ARGM-EXT
education*  
,  
counter-propaganda  
,  
boycott*  
whenever  
feasible  <ARGM-TMP
and  
access*  
to  
Western  
media  <ARG1
,  
internet  
and  
the  
international  
scene  
.  

Above  
all  >ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >ARG0
need*  
a  
total  >ARGM-ADJ
absolute  >ARGM-ADJ
unity  <ARG1
and  
determination*  
of  
the  
civilized  
world  <ARG0
against  
all  
three  
circles  <ARGM-GOL
of  
evil  
.  

Allow*  
me  >>ARG1
,  
for  
a  
moment  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
to  
depart*  
from  
my  
alleged  
role  <ARG1
as  
a  
taxi  
driver  
and  
return*  
to  
science  <ARG4
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
have*  >ARGM-TMP
a  
malignant  
tumor  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
remove*  
the  
tumor  <ARG1
itself  
surgically  <ARGM-MNR
.  

You  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-ADV
starve*  
it  <ARG1
by  
preventing*  
new  
blood  >ARG0
from  
reaching*  
it  <ARG1
from  
other  
parts  <ARGM-DIR
of  
the  
body  
,  
thereby  >ARGM-ADV
preventing*  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
supplies*  
"  
from  
expanding*  
the  
tumor  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
want*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
be*  
sure*  
,  
it  
is*  
best*  
to  
do*  
both  <ARG1
.  

But  
before  
you  >>ARG0
fight*  
and  
win*  
,  
by  
force  <ARGM-MNR
or  
otherwise  
,  
you  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
realize*  
that  
you  >ARG1
are*  
in  
a  
war*  
,  
and  
this  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
Europe  <ARG2
a  
few  
more  
years  <ARG1
.  

In  
order  
to  
win*  >>ARGM-PRP
,  
it  
is*  
necessary*  
to  
first  >ARGM-TMP
eliminate*  
the  
terrorist  
regimes  <ARG1
,  
so  
that  
no  
Government  >ARG0
in  
the  
world  
will  >ARGM-MOD
serve*  
as  
a  
safe  
haven  <ARG1
for  
these  
people  
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
comment*  
here  <ARGM-LOC
on  
whether  
the  
American  
-  
led  >ARG0
attack*  >>ARG1
on  
Iraq  <ARG1
was*  
justified*  
from  
the  
point  <ARGM-ADV
of  
view*  
of  
weapons  
of  
mass  >ARGM-ADJ
destruction*  
or  
any  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
pre-war  >ARGM-TMP
argument*  
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
look*  
at  
the  
post-war  
map  <ARG1
of  
Western  
Asia  
.  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
that  
Afghanistan  >ARG1
,  
Iraq  
and  
Libya  
are*  
out  <ARG2
,  
two  
and  
a  
half  
terrorist  
states  >ARG1
remain*  
:  
Iran  <C-ARG1
,  
Syria  
and  
Lebanon  
,  
the  
latter  >ARG1
being*  
a  
Syrian  
colony  <ARG2
.  

Perhaps  >>ARGM-ADV
Sudan  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
added*  
to  
the  
list  <ARG2
.  

As  
a  
result  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
conquest  
of  
Afghanistan  
and  
Iraq  
,  
both  
Iran  >>ARG2
and  
Syria  
are*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
totally  >ARGM-EXT
surrounded*  
by  
territories  <ARG1
unfriendly  
to  
them  
.  

Iran  >>ARG2
is*  
encircled*  
by  
Afghanistan  <ARG1
,  
by  
the  
Gulf  
States  <C-ARG1
,  
Iraq  
and  
the  
Moslem  
republics  
of  
the  
former  
Soviet  
Union  
.  

Syria  >>ARG2
is*  
surrounded*  
by  
Turkey  <ARG1
,  
Iraq  
,  
Jordan  
and  
Israel  
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
a  
significant  >ARGM-EXT
strategic  >ARG1
change*  
and  
it  >ARG0
applies*  
strong  
pressure  <ARG1
on  
the  
terrorist  
countries  <ARG2
.  

It  
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
surprising  <ARG2
that  
Iran  >>ARG0
is*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
active*  
in  
trying*  
to  
incite*  
a  
Shiite  >ARG0
uprising*  
in  
Iraq  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
if  
the  
American  >ARG0
plan*  >ARG1
was*  
actually  <ARGM-ADV
to  
encircle*  
both  
Iran  <ARG2
and  
Syria  
,  
but  
that  >ARG1
is*  
the  
resulting*  
situation  <ARG2
.  

In  
my  
humble  
opinion  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
number  
one  
danger  >ARG1
to  
the  
world  
today  >ARGM-TMP
is*  
Iran  <ARG2
and  
its  
regime  
.  

It  >>ARG0
definitely  >ARGM-ADV

Iran  >ARG0

it  >ARG1

certainly  <ARGM-ADV
behind

of  
the

the

at

in

in  
South  
America  
and  
probably  
also  
in  
Uzbekistan

Saudi

it  >ARG0

certain

Nevertheless  >>ARGM-ADV

dry  <ARG1
the

It  >>ARG0

between  
the

crucial  <ARG2

other

of  
the  
outer

which  >R-ARG1

the  
fertile  
breeding  
ground  <ARG2
of

is*  
important*  
to  
monitor*  
all

from  
the

organizations  <ARG2

any

to  
any  <ARG2
of  
the  
three  
circles  
of  
terrorism  
.  

It  
is*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
important*  
to  
act*  
decisively  <ARGM-MNR
against  
the  
campaign*  
of  
lies*

to

those

out  
of  
naivety  <ARGM-CAU

Above  
all  >ARGM-ADV
,  
never  >ARGM-NEG
surrender*  
to  
terror  <ARG2
.  

No  
one  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
ever  >ARGM-TMP
know*  
whether  
the  
recent  >ARGM-TMP
elections*  >>ARG0
in  
Spain  <ARGM-LOC
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
yielded*  
a  
different

if  
not  
for  
the  
train  >ARG1

a  
few  
days  
earlier  <ARGM-TMP

But  >>ARGM-DIS
it  >>ARG1
really  >>ARGM-ADV
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
matter*  
.  

What  >ARG1
matters*  >ARG1
is*  
that  
the  
terrorists  >ARG0
believe*  
that  
they  >ARG0
caused*  
the  
result  <ARG1
and  
that  
they  >ARG0
won*  
by  
driving*  
Spain  <ARG1
out  
of  
Iraq  <ARG2
.  

The  
Spanish  
story  >>ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
surely  >ARGM-ADV
end*  
up  
being*  
extremely  
costly  <ARG2
to  
other  
European  
countries  
,  
including  
France  >>ARG0

who  >>R-ARG0
is*  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
expelling*

veils  <ARG1
and  
including  
others  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
sent*  
troops  <ARG1
to  
Iraq  <ARG2
.  

In  
the  
long  >ARGM-ADJ
run*  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Spain  >ARG0
itself  
will  >ARGM-MOD
pay*  
even  
more  <ARG1
.  

Is*  
the  
solution*  
a  
democratic  
Arab  
world  <<ARG2

If  
by  
democracy  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
mean*  >>ARGM-ADV
free  >ARGM-MNR

also  
free

then  >ARGM-ADV

If

,  
it  
is*  
likely*  
that  
the  
most  
fanatic  
regime  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
elected*  
,  
the  
one  >>ARG0
whose  >>ARG0
incitement*  >>R-ARG0
and  
fabrications*  
are*  
the  
most  >ARGM-EXT
inflammatory*  
.  

We  >>ARG0
have*  
seen*  
it  <ARG1
already  <ARGM-TMP
in  
Algeria  <ARGM-LOC

,  
to  
a  
certain  
extent  
,  
in

It  >ARG1

again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
if  
the  
ground  >>ARG1

not  >ARGM-NEG
prepared*  
very  
carefully  <ARGM-MNR

On  
the  
other  
hand  >ARGM-ADV
,  
a  
certain  
transition  
democracy  >>ARG0
,  
as  
in  
Jordan  >ARGM-PRD
,  
may  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
better  >ARGM-ADJ
temporary  >ARGM-TMP
solution*  
,  
paving*  
the  
way*  
for  
the  
real  
thing  <<ARG2

perhaps  
in  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  >>ARGM-MNR
that  >>R-ARGM-MNR
an  
immediate  
sudden  
democracy  >>ARG1
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
work*  
in  
Russia  <ARGM-LOC
and  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
have*  
worked*  
in  
China  <ARGM-LOC

I  >>ARG0
have*  >ARGM-LVB
no  >ARGM-NEG
doubt*  
that  
the  
civilized  
world  >ARG0

prevail*

But  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
longer  >ARG1

takes*  >>ARGM-ADV
us  <ARG2

understand*  
the

costly  >>ARG2

Europe  >ARG1

more  >ARGM-ADV
than  
any

the  
key  <ARG2

recoil  >>ARG1

following  
the  
horrors  
of

the  
contemplated  >ARGM-PRD

An  
early  
September  
2003  
Newsweek  
article  >ARG2
included*  
a  
rumor*  
by  
a  
Taliban

that  
at  
a  
meeting*  >>ARGM-TMP
in  
April  <ARGM-TMP

was*  
planning*  
an

the

a  
report*  >ARG0
by  
a

June  <ARGM-TMP

,  
2004

the

that

On  
August  >>ARGM-TMP

,  
2004  
,  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
announced*  
that  
in  
the  
Spring  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
2001  
,  
a  
man  >>ARG0
named*  
El  <ARG2

Shukrijumah

also  >ARGM-DIS
known*  
as  
Jafar  <ARG2
the

who  >R-ARG1

a

In  
a

the

The  
CIA  >>ARG0
reportedly  >>ARGM-ADV

been*  
quietly  >ARGM-MNR
building*  
a  
case*  
that  
the  
anthrax

behind  
the  
earlier

the  
US  
,  
and  
that  
the  
mailings  >ARG0

as  
a  
threat  <ARG1
and  
warning*  
.  

Princeton  
islamist  
scholar  
Bernard  >>ARG0
Lewis  
has*  
explained*  
that  
while  
islamists  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD

that

the

stages  
of

Zawahiri  >>ARG1
was*  
associated*  
with  
a  
faction  >ARG1
of  
the  
Egyptian  
Islamic  
Jihad  
known*  
as  
the  
Vanguards  <ARG2
of  
Conquest  
.  

Zawahiri  >>ARG0
and  
the  
Vanguards  
of  
Conquest  
were*  
seeking*  
to  
recreate*  
Mohammed  >ARG0

taking*  
of  
mecca  <ARG1
by  
a  
small  
band  <ARGM-MNR

on  
Egyptian  
leaders  <ARG1

By  
1998  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
Zawahiri  >>ARG0
had*  
determined*  
that  
the  
Egyptian  
Islamic  
Jihad  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
focus*  
on  
its  >ARG0
struggle*  
against  
the

and  
hold*  
off  
on  
further  >ARGM-ADJ
attacks*  
against  
the  
Egyptian  
regime  <ARG1
.  

A  
key  >ARGM-ADJ
question*  >ARG1
is*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
they  >ARG0
acquired*  
the  
anthrax  
strain  >ARG1
first  >ARGM-TMP
isolated*  
by  
the  
Texas

1980  <ARGM-TMP

According  
to  
senior  
counter  
terrorism  
officials  >ARGM-ADV
,  
both  
here  
and  
abroad  
,  
among  
the  
supporters  >ARG2
of  
these  
militant  
islamists  
were*  
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
blended*  
into  
society  <ARG2

were*  
available*  
to  
act*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
another  
part  >ARG0
of  
the  
network  
requested*  
it  <ARG1
.  

A  
few  
days  
before  
Christmas  >>ARGM-TMP
2003  
,  
after  
a  
renewed  
audiotape  
threat  >>ARGM-TMP
by  
Zawahiri  
of  
attacks*  >ARG1
,  
to  
include*  
in  
the  
US  
homeland  <ARG2

the  
threat  
level  >>ARG1
was*  
raised*  
to  
orange  <ARG4

"  
high

"  

After  
the  
alert  
condition  >>ARG1
had*  
long  
since  >ARGM-TMP
returned*  >ARGM-TMP
to  
yellow  <ARG4
,  
Zawahiri  >ARG0
in  
late  
February  >ARGM-TMP
issued*  
another  
audiotape  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
urged*  
the  
President  <ARG1
that  
brigades  >>ARG0

brigades  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
coming*  
under  
the  
banner  <ARG2
of  
jihad  
carrying*  
death*  
and  
seeking*  
paradise  <ARG1
.  

Zawahiri  >ARG0
said*  
that  
the  
US  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
expect*  
another  
9/11  <ARG1
on  
US  
soil  
.  

According  
to  
some  
reports*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
Zawahiri  >>ARG1
is*  
thought*  
by  
intelligence  <ARG0
to  
be*  
somewhere  <ARG2
near  
the  
border  
of  
Pakistan  
and  
Afghanistan  
.  

At  
one  
time  >ARGM-TMP
,  
some  >ARG0
thought*  
he  >>ARG1
had*  
been*  
spotted*  
in  
Iran  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Wherever  >>ARGM-ADV
he  >ARG1
is*  
,  
authorities  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
focus*  
on  
the  
traceable  >ARGM-ADJ
connection*  
between  
him  <ARG1
and  
those  >ARG1

recruited*  
.  

In  
October  >>ARGM-TMP

,  
did*  
the

profilers  >ARG0

explained*  
that

A

released  
islamist  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG1
had*  
been*  
a  
close  
associate  <ARG2
of

that  
Zawahiri  >>ARG0
spent*  
a

had*  
made*  >ARGM-LVB
15

to  
recruit*  
the  
necessary  
expertise  <ARG1
to  
weaponize*  
anthrax  <ARG1

Russia  <ARGM-LOC

the  
Middle  
East

The  
US  
Army

the

it  <ARG2

There  
was*  
lax  >ARGM-ADJ
control*  
over  
the  
distribution*  
of  
the  
Ames  
strain  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
was*  
used*  
,  
especially  
in  
light  <<ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
fact  
that  
transfers*  >>ARG1

not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV

to  
be*  
recorded*  
prior

the

it  <ARG1
nearly  
a  
quarter

In  
Fall  >>ARGM-TMP
2004  
,  
MSNBC  >>ARG0
,  
relying*  >ARGM-ADV
on  
an  
unnamed

reports*  
that

a

from

can  >ARGM-MOD

out  
that  
it  >>ARG1

At  
least  
according  
to  
the  
public  >ARGM-ADJ
comments*  >ARGM-ADV
by  
bioweaponeer  
experts  <ARG0
William  
Patrick  
and  
Kenneth  
Alibek  
,  
under  
the  
optimal  
method  >ARGM-ADV

there  
is*  
no  
electrostatic

In  
the  
case*  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
anthrax  >ARG1
used*  
in  
the  
mailings  <ARG2
,  
there  
was*  
an  
electrostatic  
charge  <ARG1
.  

Although  
there  
was*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
dominance*  
of  
single  
spores  <ARG0
and  
a  
trillion  
spore  >ARG1
concentration*  
,  
there  
were*  
clumps  <ARG1
as  
large  
as  
40  
-  
100  
microns  
.  

(  
Spores  >>ARG1
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
bigger*  
than  
5  
microns  <ARGM-CXN

be*  
inhalable  <ARG2

)  

Many  >ARG0
point*  
to  
the  
trillion  
spore  >ARG1
concentration*  
as  
extraordinary  <<ARGM-PRD
.  

It  
is*  
far  >ARGM-CXN
simpler*  
,  
however  <ARGM-DIS
,  
to  
achieve*  
a  
trillion  
spore  >ARG1
concentration*  
in  
the  
production*  
of  
a  
few  
grams  <ARG1
than  
in  
industrial  >ARGM-ADJ
processing*  
typical  <ARGM-ADJ
of  
a  
state  >ARG0
sponsored*  
lab  <ARG1
.  

The  
"  
trillion  
spore  >ARG0
"  
issue*  >ARG1
was*  
at  
the  
heart  <ARG2
of  
a  
lot  
of  
mistaken  
theories  >ARG0
of  
the  
matter  
concluding*  
that  
state

was*  
necessarily  >ARGM-MNR
indicated*  
.  

The  
reported  >ARGM-PRD
finding*  >ARG0
at  
Dugway  <ARGM-LOC
undermines*  
the  
argument*  
of  
both  
the  
"  
bomb*  
Iraq  <ARG1
"  
crowd  <<ARG0
and  
the  
liberals  >ARG0

on  
Dr.  
Steve  
Hatfill  
who  >R-ARG0
object*  
to  
US  >ARG0

because  
they  >ARG0

it  <ARG1
as

useful*  
for  
offensive  
purposes  <ARG2
.  

USDA  
employee  
Johnelle  >ARG0
Bryant  
first  >ARGM-TMP
told*  
us  <ARG2

in  
sensational  
detail  <ARGM-MNR

of

inquiries*  
about

Khalid  >ARG0

that  
Zacarias  >ARG0

's  
inquiries*  >>ARG1

Although  
the

documents  
on  
Mohammed  
's  
computer  
may  >ARGM-MOD
(

)  
point*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
possible  
difficulties  <ARG2
in  
aerial  
dispersal  
,  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
fully  >ARGM-EXT
consistent*  
with  
the  
product  >ARG1
used*  
in  
the  
anthrax  
mailings  <ARG2

Al  
Qaeda  >ARG0
had*  
both  
the  
means  <ARG1
and  
opportunity  
.  

US  
-  
trained  
Malaysian  
biochemist  
Yazid  >ARG0

met*  
with  
9/11  
plotters  <ARG1
and  
two  
hijackers  
in  
January  <ARGM-TMP
2000

Sufaat  >ARG1
was*  
a

a  
member  
of  
Jemaah  
Islamiah

JI  >ARG0
has*  
ties  <ARG1

the  
Moro

Sufaat  >>ARG0

buy*  
items  <ARG1

at

was*  
trying*  
to  
arrange*  
for  
flight  >ARG1
lessons*  
in  
Malaysia  <ARGM-LOC

Yazid  >>ARG0
Sufaat  
provided*  
Moussaoui  <ARG2
with  
a  
letter  >ARG0

that  
he  >ARG1

a  
marketing  
representative  <ARG2

Infocus  
Technologies

allegedly  >ARGM-ADV
provided*  
him  <ARG2
$  <ARG1
35,000

The  
crop  
dusters  >>ARG1
were*  
to  
be*  
part  <ARG2
of  
a  
"  
second  >ARGM-ADJ
wave*  
.  
"  

After  
9/11  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Yazid  >>ARG0
Sufaat  
traveled*  
to  
Afghanistan  <ARG1

Pakistan  
to  
work*  
for  
the  
Taliban  
Medical  
Brigade  <ARG2

to  
continue*  
his  >ARG0
work*  
with  
anthrax  <ARG1

As  
described*  >>ARGM-ADV
in  
US  
News  <ARGM-LOC
,  
a  
former  
reporter  >>ARG0
from  
the  
Kabul  
Times  
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
met*  
Sufaat  <ARG1
,  
without  
realizing*  
it  <ARG1
,  
while  
traveling*  
near  
Kabul  <ARG1
in  
October  <ARGM-TMP
2001  
,  
perceiving*  
him  <ARG1
as  
Filipino  <ARG2
.  

The  
fellow  >>ARG0
was*  
carrying*  
papers  <ARG1
from  
Zawahiri  
and  
bragging*  
about  
his  
ability  <ARG1
to  
manipulate*  
anthrax  <ARG1
.  

Sufaat  >>ARG1
was*  
arrested*  
in  
December  <ARGM-TMP
2001  
upon  
his  >ARG1
return*  
to  
Malaysia  <ARG4
.  

Newsweek  >ARG0
reported*  
that  
a  
"  
second  >ARGM-ADJ
wave*  >>ARG1
"  
involving*  
biological  >ARGM-MNR
attacks*  
had*  
been*  
thwarted*  
upon  
the  
arrest*  
of  
Al

members  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
had*  
been*  
intended*  
to  
provide*  
logistical  >ARG1

.  

Various  
doctors  >>ARG1
,  
both  
foreign  
and  
American  
,  
are*  
associated*  
with  
Al

leaders  <ARG2

operatives  
,  
to  
include*  
the  
doctors  <ARG1
Abdul  
Qadoos  
Khan  
,  
a  
bacteriologist  
from  
Rawalpindi  
and  
Aafia  
Siddiqui  
,  
PhD  
,  
from  
Karachi  
.  

Microbiologist  
Abdul  >>ARG1
Qadoos  
Khan  
was*  
charged*  
along  
with  
his  
son  <ARGM-COM
,  
Ahmed  
,  
for  
harboring*  
the  
fugitives  <ARG1

As  
of  
March  >>ARGM-TMP
28  
,  
2003  
,  
he  >>ARG2
was*  
in  
a  
hospital  <ARG2
for  
a  
cardiac  
problem  <ARGM-CAU
and  
had*  
been*  
granted*  
"  
pre-arrest  
bail  <ARG1

"  

Yet  >>ARGM-DIS
all  >>ARG1
you  >ARG0
read*  
about  <C-ARG3
at  
the  
time  <ARGM-TMP
was*  
the  
arrest*  
of  
the  
son  >ARG0
Ahmed  
Abdul  
Qadoos  
,  
who  >R-ARG0
receives*  
a  
stipend  <ARG1
from  
the  
UN  <ARG2
for  
being*  
officially  >ARGM-ADV
low*  
-  
IQ  <ARG2
due  
to  
lead  >ARG2
poisoning*  
.  

It  
was*  
Khalid  >ARG0
Mohammed  
who  >R-ARG0
told*  
authorities  <ARG2
about  
Aafia  >ARG0
Siddiqui  
,  
who  >R-ARG0
has*  
a  
PhD  <ARG1
from  
Brandeis  
in  
neurology  
.  

The  
Pakistani  
press  >ARG0
reported*  
that  
she  >>ARG1
was*  
nabbed*  
in  
Karachi  <ARG2
after  
being*  
spotted*  
at  
the  
airport  <ARGM-LOC
in  
late  
March  <ARGM-TMP
or  
early  
April  
2003  
.  

If  
mistaken  
,  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
did*  
those  
reports*  >ARG1
first  >ARGM-TMP
come*  
about  
?  

Understandably  >ARGM-DIS
,  
Amerithrax  >ARG1
is*  
a  
confidential  >ARGM-ADJ
investigation*  
.  

The  
Pakistan  
ISI  >ARG0
and  
CIA  
rarely  >ARGM-TMP
grant*  
press  >ARG0
interviews*  
in  
connection*  
with  
an  
ongoing  
manhunt  <ARG2
.  

The  
CIA  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
allow*  
the  
FBI  <ARG1
access*  
to  
KSM  <ARG1
for  
10  
days  <<ARGM-TMP
after  
his  >ARG1
arrest*  
.  

As  
agent  
Van  >>ARG0
Harp  
,  
then  
head  
of  
the  
Amerithrax  >ARG1

said*  >>ARGM-ADV

is*  
classified  <ARG2

limited  
information  <ARG1

While  
it  
's*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
easy*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
separate*  
fact  <ARG1
from  
fiction  <ARG2
,  
Attorney  
General  
Ashcroft  >>ARG0
and  
Director  
Mueller  
have*  
publicly  >ARGM-MNR
confirmed*  
Aafia  >>ARG1
is*  
still  >>ARGM-TMP
being*  
sought*  
.  

They  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
know*  
.  

Her  
mother  >ARG0
Ismat  
last  >ARGM-TMP
saw*  
Aafia  <ARG1
and  
her  
grandchildren  
before  
they  >ARG0
left*  
in  
a  
minicab  <ARGM-MNR

the  
end*  
of  
March  <ARG1

Aafia  >ARG1
was*  
on  
her  >ARG0

with  
her  
children  <<ARGM-COM

visit*  
and  
uncle  <ARG1

a  
friend  
in  
Islamabad

According  
to  
the  
Pakistan  >ARG0
reports*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
Aafia  >>ARG1
Siddiqui  
was*  
detained*  
after  
being*  
spotted*  
at  
Karachi  
International  
airport  <ARGM-LOC

.  

(  
Karachi  >ARG1
is*  
in  
the  
south  <ARG2

.  

The  
reports*  >ARG0
say*  
she  >>ARG2

suspected*  
of  
having*  
been*  
a

lawyer  >ARG0

me  <ARG1
that  
Aafia  >>ARG0

enough  
money  <ARG1

pay*  
for  
airfare  
tickets  <ARG3

the  
kids

called*

the  
train

That  >ARG1
was*  
the  
last  >ARG1

heard*  
from  
her  <ARG2

Aafia  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
reached*  
the  
uncle  
's  
house  <ARG1
.  

Perhaps  >ARGM-ADV
something  >ARG1

lost  <ARG2
in  
the  
translation*  
,  
but  
the  
phrase  >>ARG1

appeared*

In  
early  
June  >>ARGM-TMP
2003  
,  
a  
CIA  >ARG0
report*  >ARG0
concluded*  
that  
the

and  
Zacarias

's  
inquiries*

the  
contemplated  >ARGM-PRD

in  
dispersing*

agents  <ARG1

as

.  

It

interested*  
in  
using*

since

The

Ahmed  
Alhaznawi  
appears*  
to  
have*  
contracted*  
cutaneous  
anthrax  <ARG2
in  
Afghanistan  <ARGM-LOC

It  
is*  
reasonable*  
to  
credit*  
his  >ARG0
statement*  
that  
he  >>ARG0

the

was*  
carrying*  
at  
a

The  
lesion  >ARG1
is*  
further  
evidence  <ARG2
of  
Al

's  
anthrax  >ARG1
production*  
program  
at  
Kandahar

The  
present  
evidence  >>ARG0
relating*  
to  
Atta  >ARG0
's  
alleged  >ARGM-ADJ

a  
conclusion*  
that

According  
to  
at  
least  
some  
reports*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Bin  >>ARG0

rejected*  
the  
suggestion*

preferring*  
to  
pursue*

head  
of  
the  
Iraq  
survey  
group  
in  
charge*  
of  
the  
hunt  <ARG2

He  >>ARG0
has*  
said*  
that  
the

The

coverage*  >>ARG0
has*  
been*  
seriously  >ARGM-EXT
confused*  
on  
the  
issue*  
of  
motive  <ARG0
and  
the  
reason  >>ARGM-CAU
Senators  >>ARG1
Daschle  
and  
Leahy  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
targeted*

tending*  
to  
simplistically  >ARGM-MNR
view*  
them  <ARG1

"  
liberals  <ARG2

"  

Zawahiri  >ARG0
likely  >ARGM-ADV
targeted*  
Senators  >ARG0
Daschle  
and  
Leahy  
to  
receive*  
anthrax  
letters  <ARG1
,  
in  
addition*  
to  
various  
media  
outlets  <ARG2
,  
because  
of  
the  
appropriations*  >ARGM-PRR
made*  
pursuant  
to  
the  
"  
Leahy  
Law  
"  
to  
military  
and  
security  
forces  
.  

That  
money  >>ARG0
has*  
prevented*  
the  
militant  
islamists  >ARG0
from  
achieving*  
their  
goals  <ARG1
.  

Al  
Qaeda  
members  >ARG0
and  
sympathizers  
feel*  
that  
the  
FBI  >ARG1
's  
involvement*  >ARG0
in  
countries  <ARG2
like  
Egypt  
,  
Saudi  
Arabia

Indonesia  
,  
and  
the  
Philippines  
interferes*  
with  
the  
sovereignty  <ARG1
of  
those  
countries  
.  

According  
to  
a  
post*  >>ARGM-ADV
she  <ARG0
made*  
on  
the  
internet  <<ARG2
,  
Aafia  >ARG0
Siddiqui  
expressed*  
the  
same  
sentiment  <ARG1
in  
connection*  
with  
US  >ARG0
appropriations*  >ARG1
sought*  
in  
exchange*  
for  
the  
extradition  <ARG3
of  
WTC  
1993  
plotter  
Ramzi  
Yousef  
from  
Pakistan  
.  

Senator  >ARG1
Leahy  
was*  
Chairman  <ARG2
of  
both  
the  
Judiciary  
Committee  >ARG0
overseeing*  
the

and  
Appropriations  
Subcommittee  
in  
charge*  
of  
foreign  >ARGM-ADJ
aid*  
to  
these  
countries  <ARG2
.  

In  
late  
September  >>ARGM-TMP
2001  
,  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
announced*  
that  
the  
President  >>ARG0
was*  
seeking*  
a  
blanket  
waiver  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
lift*  
all  
restrictions*  
on

and  
security  
units  <ARG2
in  
connection*  
with  
pursuing*  
the  
militant  
islamists  <ARG1

This  
extradition  >>ARG1
and  
imprisonment  
of  
Al  
Qaeda  
leaders  
,  
along  
with  
US  >ARG0
support*  
for  
Israel  <ARG1
and  
the  
Mubarak  
government  
in  
Egypt  
,  
remains*  
foremost  <ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
mind  <ARG3
of  
Dr.  
Zawahiri  
.  

At  
the  
height  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
development*  
of  
his  
biological  
weapons  
program  <ARG1
,  
his  
brother  >>ARG1
was*  
extradited*  
pursuant  <ARGM-ADV
to  
a  
death  >ARG2
sentence*  
in  
the  
"  
Albanian  
returnees  >ARG1
"  
case*  
(  
now  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
faces*  
retrial  <ARG1
)  
.  

It  
's*  
hard*  
to  
keep*  
up  
with  
the  
stories  <ARG1
about  
billion  
dollar  >ARG1
appropriations*  
,  
debt  
forgiveness  
,  
and  
loan  >ARG1
guarantees*  
to  
countries  <<ARGM-GOL
like  
Egypt  
and  
Israel  
and  
now  
even  
Pakistan  
.  

Those  
appropriations*  >ARG1
pale*  
in  
comparison*  
to  
the  
many  
tens  >>ARG1
of  
billions  
in  
appropriations*  
relating*  
to  
the  
invasion*  
of  
Iraq  <ARG1
.  

Al  
Qaeda  >ARG0
had*  
a  
motive  <ARG1
in  
mind  <ARGM-ADV
.  

In  
his  
Fall  
2001  
book  >>ARGM-LOC
titled*  
Knights  <ARG2
under  
the  
Banner  
of  
the  
Prophet  
,  
Zawahiri  >>ARG0
argued*  
that  
the  
secular  
press  >>ARG0
was*  
telling*  
"  
lies*  
"  
about  
the  
militant  
islamists  <ARG3
--  
to  
include*  
the  
suggestion*  
that  
the  
militant  
islamists  >>ARG1
were*  
somehow  >ARGM-ADV
the  
creation*  
of  
the  
United  
States  <ARG0
in  
connection*  
with  
expelling*  
the  
Russians  <ARG1
from  
Afghanistan  <ARG2
.  

Zawahiri  >ARG0
argued*  
instead  <ARGM-ADV
that  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
active*  
since  
the  
assassination*  
of  
Anwar  <ARG1
Sadat  
in  
Egypt  <ARGM-LOC
because  
of  
the  
Camp  
David  
Accord  <ARGM-CAU
and  
the  
resulting*  
peace  
treaty  <ARG2
between  
Egypt  
and  
Israel  
.  

The  
anthrax  
letters  >>ARG1
were*  
sent*  
on  
the  
date  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
Camp  
David  
Accord  
and  
then  
the  
date  >>ARGM-TMP
Anwar  >>ARG1
Sadat  
was*  
assassinated*  
as  
if  
to  
underscore*  
the  
point  <ARG1
to  
anyone  >>ARG0
paying*  >ARGM-LVB
attention*  
.  

Most  >>ARG0
of  
the  
"  
talking  
heads  
"  
on  
television  
,  
however  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
knew*  
only  <ARGM-ADV
that  
Daschle  >ARG1
and  
Leahy  
were*  
liberal  
democrats  <ARG2
and  
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
anything  <ARG1
of  
Al  
Qaeda  
beyond  
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
read*  
in  
the  
US  
newspapers  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
FBI  
's  
profile  >ARG2
includes*  
a  
US  >ARGM-LOC
-  
based*  
supporter  <ARG1
of  
the  
militant  
islamists  
.  

Attorney  
General  
Ashcroft  >ARG0
explained*  
that  
an  
"  
either  
-  
or  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
approach*  >>ARG1
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
useful*  
.  

The  
media  >>ARG0
has*  
tended*  
to  
overlook*  
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
FBI  >ARG0
uses*  >ARGM-TMP
the  
word  <ARG1
"  
domestic  
"  
the  
word  >ARG2
includes*  
a  
US  >ARGM-LOC
-  
based*  
,  
highly  
-  
educated  
supporter  <ARG1
of  
the  
militant  
islamists  
.  

There  
is*  
an  
emerging*  
consensus  <ARG0
that  
anthrax  >>ARG1
was*  
contained*  
in  
a  
letter  <ARG0
to  
AMI  
,  
the  
publisher  
of  
the  
National  
Enquirer  
--  
in  
a  
goofy  
love  
letter  >>ARG0

Jennifer  
Lopez  
enclosing*  
a  
Star  <ARG2

(  
as  
well  
as  
detailed  >ARGM-ADJ
interviews*  
by  
author  
Leonard  <ARG0
Cole  
)  
supports*  
the  
conclusion*  
that  
there  
were*  
not  
one  
,  
but  
two  
,  
such  
mailings  >ARG0
containing*  
anthrax  <ARG1
.  

(  
The  
letters  >ARG1
were*  
to  
different  >ARGM-ADJ

one

the

been*  
addressed*  
to

This  
tactic  >ARG1
of  
letters  
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
merely  <ARGM-ADV
the  
modus  
operandi  <ARG2
of  
these  
militant  
islamists  >ARG1
inspired*  
by  
Zawahiri  <ARG0
,  
it  >ARG1
is*  
their  
signature  <ARG2

The  
islamists  >ARG0

letter  
bombs  <ARG1

January  <ARGM-TMP

to  
newspaper  
offices  <ARG2
in  
New  
York  
City  
and  
Washington  
,  
D.C.

They  >>ARG1

with  
the  
earlier  >ARGM-TMP

The

the  
letter  
bombs  >ARG1
--  
which  >R-ARG1
resulted*  
in  
minimal  
casualty  <ARG2

was*  
to

two  
sons  
have*  
had*  >ARGM-LVB
considerable  >ARGM-EXT

over  
Bin  <ARG1

.  

He  >ARG0
reportedly  >ARGM-ADV
treated*  
them  <ARG1
like  
sons  <ARG2
.  

Although  
while  
in  
jail  >ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
early  
1980s  
,  
Zawahiri  >>ARG0
caused*  >>ARGM-ADV
considerable  >ARGM-EXT
tension*  
by  
challenging*  
the  
blind  
sheik  >ARG0
's  
ability  <ARG1
to  
lead*  
a  
coalition  <ARG1
of  
the  
Egyptian  
Islamic

the  
Egyptian  
Islamic  
Group  
,  
Zawahiri  >ARG1
and  
OBL  
are*  
Rahman  
's  
friends  <ARG2
.  

The  
imprisoned*  
WTC  
1993  
plotter  >ARG1
Yousef  
was*  
KSM  
's  
nephew  <ARG2
.  

Thus  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
leaders  >>ARG1
in  
charge*  
of  
Al  
Qaeda  
's  
anthrax  >ARG1
production*  
program  <<ARG2
had*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
close  >ARGM-ADJ
connection*  
to  
those  >ARG1

in  
connection*  
with  
the  
earlier  >ARGM-TMP
bombing*  
of  
the  
World  
Trade

According  
to  
the  
controversial  
"  
Feith  >>ARGM-ADV
memo  
,  
"  
which  >R-ARG0
summarized*  
purported*  
intelligence  >ARG0
showing*  
an  
Iraqi  >ARG1

Al

connection*  
,  
Osama  >>ARG0

had*  
asked*  
Iraqi  
intelligence  <ARG2

technical  >ARGM-MNR

in

letter  
bombs  <ARG1
a  
half  
year  
before  
the  
Al

letters  >>ARG1
were*  
sent*  
.  

Just  
because  
Al

its  
truck  
bombs  >>ARG0

the

not  >ARGM-NEG

the

As

"

i.e.  
,  
Cairo

Egyptian  
Islamic

the  
Islamic

The  
sender  >>ARG0
probably  >>ARGM-ADV

announcing*  
that

of  
either  
Egyptian

actually  <ARGM-ADV
the  
full

after

At

for

In  
a

As  
to  
opportunity  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
though  
seldom  >ARGM-TMP
reported*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
there  
is*  
a  
wealth  <ARG1
of  
"  
open  
source  
"  
information  
about  
possible  
Al  
Qaeda  
or  
Egyptian  
Islamic  
Jihad  
or  
Egyptian  
Islamic  
Group  
in  
the  
United  
States  <ARGM-LOC
and  
Canada  
.  

The  
public  
information  >ARG1
mostly  >ARGM-ADV
relates*  
to  
those  
suspected  
sleepers  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG1
have*  
been*  
detained*  
or  
who  >>R-ARG1
are*  
at  
large  <ARG2
and  
are*  
being*  
sought*  
.  

Zawahiri  >ARG0
's  
mission*  >ARG1
in  
the  
United  
States  <ARGM-LOC
in  
1995  <ARGM-TMP
was*  
to  
do*  
spadework  <ARG1
for  
terrorism  <ARG2
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
fundraising*  
for  
charitable  
causes  <ARG2
.  

He  >>ARG1
traveled*  
under  
an  
alias  <ARGM-MNR
and  
was*  
accompanied*  
by  
a  
former  
US  
Army  
sergeant  >ARG1
named*  
Ali  <ARG2
Mohammed  
.  

What  
mosques  >>ARG1
exactly  
did*  
they  >ARG0
visit*  
and  
who  >>ARG1
did*  
they  >ARG0
meet*  
?  

Whatever  >ARGM-ADV
your  
political  
persuasion  
,  
the  
FBI  >ARG0
and  
CIA  
deserve*  
our  >ARG0
support*  
.  

We  >ARG1
are*  
,  
after  
all  <ARGM-ADV
,  
in  
this  <ARG2
together  <ARGM-ADV
.  

First  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
nature  >>ARG1
of  
such  
an  
investigation*  
is*  
that  
we  >ARG0
lack*  
sufficient  
information  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
second  >ARGM-TMP
-  
guess*  
(  
or  
even  >ARGM-ADV
know*  
)  
what  >>ARG1
the  
FBI  >>ARG0
is*  
doing*  
.  

Media  >ARG0
reports*  >ARG1
are*  
a  
poor  >ARGM-ADJ
approximation*  
of  
reality  <ARG1
because  
of  
the  
lack*  
of  
good  
sources  <ARG1
.  

Second  >ARGM-TMP
,  
hindsight  >ARG1
is*  
20  
/  
20  <ARG2
.  

Third  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
with  
the  
"  
new  
age  
"  
Efrem  
Zimbalist  
,  
Jr.  
in  
charge*  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
investigation*  
,  
it  
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
likely*  
we  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
better  <ARGM-MNR
in  
striking*  
the  
appropriate  
balance  <ARG1
between  
due  >ARGM-ADJ
process*  
and  
national  
security  
.  

Finally  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
"  
Hatfill  >>ARG0
theory  
"  
seems*  
to  
have*  
been*  
exhausted*  
or  
at  >ARGM-ADV
least  
lost*  
public  
favor  <ARG1
.  

The  
"  
Hatfill  >>ARG1
theory  
"  
accusing*  
Dr.  <ARG1
Stephen  
Hatfill  
was*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
highly  >ARGM-EXT
dubious*  
.  

The  
suspicion*  >>ARG1
was*  
founded*  
on  
many  
false  
premises  <ARG2
,  
and  
there  
was*  
no  
reliable  
publicly  
known  
evidence  >ARG0
indicating*  
his  
guilt  <ARG1
.  

The  
FBI  >ARG0
's  
fixation*  >>ARG1
on  
Hatfill  <ARG2
(  
at  
least  
as  
rumored*  >>ARGM-ADV
by  
some  
reporters  <ARG0
)  
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
stemmed*  
from  
a  
warning*  
by  
one  
Senator  <ARG0
that  
careers  >ARG1
hung*  
in  
the  
balance  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Leahy  
's  
chief  >ARG0
of  
staff  
apparently  >ARGM-ADV
started*  
with  
the  
strong  >ARGM-ADJ
predisposition*  
that  
some  
right  
-  
winger  >>ARG1
was*  
involved*  
because  
two  
liberal  
democrats  >>ARG1
had*  
been*  
targeted*  
.  

The  
Hatfill  >>ARG1
theory  
--  
to  
include*  
ongoing  >ARGM-TMP
interviews*  
and  
ongoing  
7  
/  
24  
surveillance  
by  
8  
surveillance  
specialists  
--  
is*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
the  
subject  <ARG2
of  
pending  >>ARGM-ADJ
civil  >ARGM-ADJ
rights*  >>ARG1
and  
libel*  
claims*  
of  
uncertain  
merit  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

A  
suit  >>ARG1
against  
the  
New  
York  
Times  
and  
columnist  
Nicholas  
Kristof  
was*  
dismissed*  
in  
late  
November  <ARGM-TMP
2004  
.  

The  
judge  >>ARG0
had*  
agreed*  
to  
delay*  
the  
civil  >ARGM-ADJ
rights*  
matter  <<ARG1
from  
proceeding*  
until  
at  
least  
October  <<ARGM-TMP
2004  
.  

The  
judge  >>ARG0
,  
frustrated*  >>ARGM-PRD
by  
the  
apparent  >ARGM-ADJ
lack*  
of  
progress*  
,  
encouraged*  
that  
the  
parties  >ARG0
reach*  
a  
negotiated  >ARGM-PRD
compromise*  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
permit*  
some  
limited  >ARGM-ADJ
discovery*  >ARG0
to  
proceed*  
(  
and  
the  
judge  >>ARG0
has*  
directed*  
that  
the  
government  >ARG0
to  
file*  
an  
Answer*  
to  
the  
Complaint*  
)  
.  

The  
Hatfill  
Theory  >>ARG1
ironically  >>ARGM-ADV
might  >>ARGM-MOD
best  >>ARGM-EXT
be*  
understood*  
as  
an  
Al  
Qaeda  
theory  <ARG2
,  
with  
a  
coincidental  >ARGM-ADJ
Malaysian  >ARG1
connection*  >ARG1
adding*  
to  
the  
other  
circumstances  <ARG2
.  

Given  
the  
regrettable  >ARGM-ADJ
leaks*  >>ARGM-CAU
that  
he  >ARG1
was*  
under  
suspicion*  
,  
it  
is*  
only  >ARGM-ADV
fair*  
that  
the  
FBI  >ARG0
leak*  
with  
equal  
enthusiasm  <ARGM-MNR
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
Dr.  >>ARG1
Hatfill  
has*  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
been*  
dropped*  
as  
a  
suspect  <ARGM-PRD
if  
and  
when  >ARGM-TMP
that  >>ARG1
proves*  
to  
be*  
the  
case*  
.  

A  
search*  >>ARG0
of  
Dr.  >ARG0
Ken  
Berry  
's  
residences*  
likely  >ARGM-ADV
will  >ARGM-MOD
prove*  
just  
about  
the  
last  
gasp  <ARG1
of  
a  
biodefense  
insider  
theory  
.  

Senior  
officials  >>ARG2
have*  
been*  
quoted*  
in  
the  
press  <ARGM-LOC
as  
saying*  
that  
the  
searches*  >ARG1
were*  
for  
the  
purpose  <ARG2
of  
excluding*  
him  <ARG1
as  
much  <<ARGM-ADV
as  
including*  
him  <ARG1
.  

Maureen  
,  

Andre  >>ARG0
is*  
going*  
to  
look*  
over*  
the  
list  <ARG1
of  
curves  >ARG1
needed*  
for  
the  
global  
assets  <ARGM-PRP
(  
August  >ARGM-TMP
Board  >ARG0
meeting*  
)  
one  
more  
time  <<ARGM-TMP
before  
I  >ARG0
forward*  
it  <ARG1
to  
you  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
make*  
sure*  
that  
we  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
request*  
FX  
and  
inflation*  
(  
CPI  
,  
PPI  
,  
etc.  
)  
curves  <<ARG1
when  >>ARGM-TMP
only  
one  >>ARG1
of  
the  
curves  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
used*  
in  
the  
valuation  >ARG1
process*  
and  
to  
determine*  
which  
inflation  
index  >>ARG1
is*  
needed*  
.  

Typically  >ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >ARG0
receive*  
both  
FX  <ARG1
and  
inflation*  
from  
you  <<ARG2
,  
but  
both  
curves  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
always  >>ARGM-TMP
be*  
used*  
.  

I  >ARG0
hope*  
that  
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
give*  
you  <ARG2
some  
time  
savings  <ARG1
by  
eliminating*  
any  
nonessential  >ARGM-ADJ
requests*  
.  

For  
now  >ARGM-TMP
,  
this  >ARG1
is*  
the  
list  <ARG2
of  
countries  
for  
which  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
need*  
the  
FX  
and  
/  
or  
inflation*  
curves  <<ARG1

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD

FYI  

Vince  

Anne  >ARGM-DIS
,  
Mike  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
call*  
you  <ARG1
regarding  
Sarah  <ARGM-PRP
.  

Vince  
,  

As  
I  >ARG0
mentioned*  
in  
my  
voice  
mail  <ARGM-LOC
,  
Mike  >>ARG0
Roberts  
going*  
to  
hire*  
Sara  <ARG1
Woody  
,  
a  
recent  
MBA  
grad  
from  
Rice  
,  
into  
his  
group  <ARGM-GOL
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG0
were*  
talking*  >ARGM-TMP
about  
this  
position  <ARG1
,  
Mike  >ARG0
compared*  
Sara  <ARG1
to  
Elena  <ARG2
.  

Elena  
's  
title  >ARG1
is*  
admin  
coordinator  <ARG2
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
know*  
that  
Sara  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
this  
title  <ARG1
,  
and  
honestly  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
that  
Elena  
should  <ARG1
also  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Admin  
coordinator's  >>ARG0
do*  >ARGM-LVB
primarily  
administrative  >ARG1
work*  
.  

I  >ARG0
suggest*  
that  
you  >>ARG0
compare*  
Elena  
and  
Sarah  
's  
duties  <ARG1
/  
level  
to  
other  
Sr.  
Spec.  <ARG2
in  
your  
group  
such  
as  
Kenneth  
Parkhill  
and  
Sevil  
to  
determine*  
if  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
equivalent*  
,  
or  
if  
their  
scope  >>ARG2
of  
responsibilities  
and  
experience*  
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
as  >ARGM-EXT
broad*  
.  

If  
the  
latter  >ARG1
is*  
the  
case  >ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
place*  
both  
Sara  <ARG1
and  
Elena  
in  
a  
specialist  
job  
group  <ARG2
(  
the  
salary  
range  >ARG1
is*  
33  
-  
66  
K  <ARG2
)  
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
advise*  
.  

Thanks*  
,  

Anne  

Clayton  
,  

Thanks*  
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT

I  >ARG0

Martin

I  >>ARG0

and  
give*  
him  <ARG2
the

by  
Friday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

This  >ARG1
was*  
(  
another  
)  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ

for  
Enron  <ARG0
.  

We  >ARG0

Michael  
:  

Thanks*  
for  
putting*  
the  
paperwork  <ARG1
together  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  >ARGM-LVB
interest*  
in  
meeting*  
if  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
present*  
unique  
investment  
opportunities  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
have*  >ARGM-LVB
access*  
to  <C-ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Most  >>ARG1
of  
my  >ARG0
contact*  
with  
financial  
advisors  <ARG1
in  
the  
past  >>ARGM-TMP
has*  
consisted*  
of  
them  >>ARG0
suggesting*  
a  
mutual  
fund  <ARG1
,  
telling*  
me  >ARG0
to  
invest*  
in  
Home  
Depot  <ARG2
,  
Sun  
,  
and  
Coke  
,  
or  
trying*  
to  
pass*  
off  
their  
banks  >ARG0
'  
biased  >ARGM-ADJ
research  >ARG1
reports*  
as  
something  <<ARG3
valuable  
.  

The  
above  >ARGM-ADJ
services*  >ARG0
provide*  
no  
value  <ARG1
to  
me  <ARG2
personally  <ARGM-ADV
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
present*  >>ARGM-ADV
opportunities  <ARG1
such  
as  
access*  
to  
private  
equity  <ARG1
or  
hedge  
funds  
,  
or  
other  
ideas  
with  
strong  
growth  
potential  
and  
low  >ARGM-EXT
correlation*  
to  
the  
S@P  <ARG2

I  >ARG0

you  <ARG2
for

At  
some  
point  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
talk*  
about  
the  
diversification  
strategy  <ARG1
in  
more  
detail  <ARGM-MNR
--  
perhaps  
over  
dinner  <ARGM-ADV

a  
quick  >ARGM-ADJ

after  
the  
markets  >ARG1
close*

Appreciate*  
the  
idea  <ARG1
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
with  
my  
natural  
long  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
looking*  
to  
really  >ARGM-ADV
trade*  
around  
the  
position  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
believe*  
ENE  >>ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
continue*  
to  
be*  
range  >ARG2
bound*  
,  
but  
in  
case  
it  >ARG1
is*  >>ARGM-ADV
not  <ARGM-NEG
,  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
forgo*  
50  
%  <ARG1
of  
my  
option  
premium  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
price  
targets  
of  
where  >ARGM-LOC
I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
lighten*  
up  
exposure*  
to  
ENE  <ARG2
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
use*  
calls*  
to  
implement*  
the  
stategy  <ARG1
.  

To

I  >ARG0

I  >>ARG0

I  >ARG0

that

in

I  <ARG1
have*

I  >>ARG0
was*  
looking*  
at  
the  
recent  
pullback  <ARG1
in  
ENE  
and  
thinking*  
it  >ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
an  
opportunity  <ARG2
to  
buy*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
the  
calls  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
sold*  
.  

Of  >ARGM-ADV
course  
,  
you  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
then  >ARGM-TMP
be*  
in  
a  
position  >ARGM-ADV
to  
sell*  
calls  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
if  
the  
stock  >>ARG1
makes*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
bounce*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure*  
that  
ENE  >ARG1
@  
75  
is*  
the

John  >>ARG0

the  
attached  >ARGM-PRD

.  

He  >>ARG1
is*  
concerned*  
about  
the  
allocation*  
amongst  
categories  <ARG2

in

,  
Real  
Time  
Traders  <ARGM-ADJ

If

please  >>ARGM-DIS
review*  
the  
entire

let*

I  >ARG0
understand*  
all  <ARG1
of  
those  
comparisons*  
,  
however  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
reality  >ARG1
is*  
if  
we  >ARG0

This  >ARG1

pretty  
easy  
math  <ARG2
for  
me  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
it

the

Despite  
the

this

appears*  
to  
be*  
a  
MTM

Per  
September

this

This

in  
2000  <ARGM-TMP
for  
the  
acquistion*  
of  
WarpSpeed

(  
now

,  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
dissolved*  
upon  
completion*  
of  
merger  <ARG1

Company  >ARG1
is*  
around  <ARG2
with  
a  
small  
amount  <ARGM-ADV
of  
assets

,  
but  
no  
I/S  
items  
.  

83N  >ARG1
is*  
my  
responsibility  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
this  
entity  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
stay*  
with  
83N  <ARG3
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
suggest*  
it  >>ARG1
be*  
assigned*  
to  
Leon  <ARG2

It  >ARG1

Not  
currently

I  >ARG0
think*  
this  >ARG1

either  
Holding*

Hello  
.  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
originally  >ARGM-ADV
inquiring*  
about  
purchasing*  
a  
Cross  
or  
Signac  
impressionist  
lithograph  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
found*  
them  <ARG1
and  
purchased*  
both  <ARG1
from  
a  
gallery  <ARG2
in  
London  
,  
William  
Weston  
.  

They  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
delivered*  
this  
week  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >>ARG0
are*  
beautiful*  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
add*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
to  
our  >ARG0
collection*  
.  

By  
the  
way  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
Lichtenstein  >>ARG1
is*  
up  <ARG2
and  
hanging*  
in  
our  
formal  
living  
room  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
is*  
magnificent  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
purchased*  
an  
Appel  <ARG1
in  
the  
last  
month  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG1
am*  
interested*  
in  
several  
artists  <ARG2
.  

Actually  
,  
a  
lot  
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
looking*  
for  
one  <ARG1
or  
more  
of  
the  
following  
.  

My  
concept  >ARG1
is*  
that  
over  
time  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
own*  
one  <ARG1
of  
all  
the  
following  
artists  
and  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
all  >ARGM-ADV
depending*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
find*  
something  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
we  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-EXT
like*  
.  

I  >ARG0
listed*  
all  <ARG1
of  
our  
(  
sometimes  
mine  
vs.  
my  
wife  
's  
favorites  
and  
priorities  
)  
.  

They  >ARG1
are*  
kind  <ARGM-ADV
of  
in  
rank  >ARG1
order*  
but  
as  
I  >ARG0
stated*  >>ARGM-ADV
if  
I  >ARG0
find*  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
piece  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
like*  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
purchase*  
it  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
want*  
signed  <ARG1
and  
numbered*  
.  

I  >ARG0
realize*  
that  
some  >>ARG1
were*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
signed*  
by  
the  
artist  <ARG0
but  
it  >ARG1
is*  
an  
important  
fact  <ARG2
in  
my  >ARG0
buying  >ARG1
decision*  
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
realize*  
that  
some  >>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
have*  
done*  >ARGM-LVB
any  
works*  
on  
paper  <ARGM-LOC
or  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
outrageously  >ARGM-EXT
expensive*  
.  

For  
example  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
know*  
if  
Rothko  >>ARG0
or  
Kline  
did*  >ARGM-LVB
any  
work*  
on  
paper  <ARGM-LOC
.  

At  >ARGM-ADV
least  
that  >ARG1
is*  
what  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
am*  
thinking*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
.

By  
the  
way  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG1
am*  
interested*  
in  
re-looking*  
at  
a  
Picasso  >>ARG1
(  
although  
we  >ARG0
have*  
2  <ARG1
)  
that  >R-ARG1
your  
gallery  >ARG0
had*  
a  
couple  
of  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
a  
cubist  
piece  <ARG2
from  
the  
1920s  
and  
I  >ARG0
believe*  
you  >ARG0
called*  
the  
technique  <ARG1
a  
"  
push  
wa  <ARG2
"  
(  
pronunciation*  
Vs  
an  
attempt*  
at  
the  
proper  >ARGM-ADJ
spelling*  
)  
.  

It  >>ARG1
was*  
for  
sale*  
in  
a  
couple  <<ARGM-LOC
of  
galleries  
in  
SF  
and  
was*  
about  
$  <ARG2
20,000  
.  

Is*  
there  
1  <ARG1
available  
?  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
am*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
thinking*  
about  
the  
Matisse  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
discussed*  
before  <ARGM-TMP
but  
as  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
other  
artists  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG1
am*  
interested*  
in  <C-ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
remain*  
on  
the  
back  
burner  <ARG3
because  
we  >ARG0
already  >ARGM-ADV
have*  
one  <ARG1
.

On  
the  
issue*  >ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
contracts  <ARG0
,  
the  
draft  >ARG0
says*  
that  
the  
$  >>ARG1
170  
m  
is*  
paid*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
EPC  
contract  >>ARG1
is*  
signed*  
.  

Are*  
we  >ARG0
expecting*  
that  
the  
portion  >>ARG1
attributable  
to  
each  
project  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
paid*  
as  
the  
individual  
EPC  
contracts  >>ARG1
are*  
signed*  
?  

Thanks*  
,  

Kay  

1  
.  
The  
pricing*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
we  >>ARG0
have*  
given*  
CRRA  <ARG2
is*  
specific  <ARG2
to  
FuelCell  
Energy  
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
meaningful  <ARG2
without  
listing*  
the  
manufacturer  <ARG1
(  
i.e.  >ARGM-ADV
,  
ONSI  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
lot  
more  
money  <ARG2
)  
.  

Hence  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
think*  
that  
we  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
reference*  
the  
manufacturer  <ARG1
.  

2  
.  
The  
attachment*  >>ARG1
of  
the  
Development  >ARG1
Agreement*  
is*  
a  
Jeff  >ARG2
question*  
.  

In  
order  
to  
mark*  >ARGM-PRP
any  
2000  
income  <ARG1
,  
we  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
to  
get*  
CRRA  >ARG0
to  
execute*  
the  
Development  >ARG1
Agreement*  
in  
2000  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

In  
my  
opinion  >ARGM-DIS
,  
we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
show*  
CRRA  <ARG2
a  
copy*  
of  
the  
LOI  <ARG1
with  
the  
assumption*  
that  
the  
Development  >ARG1
Agreement*  >>ARG1
is*  
attached*  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
actually  >ARGM-ADV
send*  
them  <ARG2
the  
draft  >ARG1
Development  >ARG1
Agreement*  
a  
couple  
days  
after  
the  
LOI  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Based  
on  
how  >ARGM-MNR
CRRA  >ARG0
reacts*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
make*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
ultimate  >ARGM-ADJ
determination*  
if  
the  
agreement*  >>ARG1
needs*  
to  
be*  
attached*  
to  
the  
LOI  <ARG2
.  

3  
.  
I  >ARG0
expect*  
at  
least  
one  
EPC  
contract  <ARG1
per  
project  
.  

We  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
condition*  
the  
acceptance*  
of  
one  
project  <ARG1
on  
the  
performance*  
of  
another  
project  <ARG1
.  

Performance  >ARG1
tests*  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
either  
be*  
performed*  
on  
a  
project  
basis  <ARGM-MNR
or  
a  
unit  
by  
unit  
basis  
in  
a  
given  
project  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Remarkably  
clear  >ARGM-MNR
explanation*  
.

for  
the

We  >>ARG0

a

call*  
with

Off  >>ARGM-ADV
and  
on  
(  
with  
Jackie  >ARG0
Gentle  
's  
help*  >>ARGM-MNR
)  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
pulled*  
together  <ARG2
a  
one  
page  
communication  
note  <ARG1
on  
our  
fundamental  
operating  
standards  
(  
itself  
a  
one  
page  
summary  
)  
.  

We  >ARG1
are*  
in  
the  
final  
stages  <ARG2
of  
this  
process*  >ARGM-ADV
-  
where  >R-ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
draft*  
a  
cover  
letter  >ARG0
for  
John  <ARG2
which  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
introduce*  
this  <ARG1
for  
inclusion*  
within  
Globalflash  <ARG2
(  
the  
Enron  
Europe  
newsletter  
)  

Have*  
you  <ARG0
any  
thoughts*  
on  
draft  
or  
cover  
note  <ARG2
?  

Mike  

Late  
Jan  >>ARG1
sounds*  
great*  
.  

Meagan  >>ARG0
does*  
have*  
a  
couple  <ARG1
of  
big  
things  
on  
the  
weekend  <ARGM-TMP
in  
January  <ARGM-TMP
--  
National  
Charity  
League  
Senior  
Presentation  <C-ARG1
(  
big  >ARGM-ADJ
dance*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
she  >>ARG1
and  
I  
are*  
committed*  
to  
help*  
with  <C-ARG1
)  
,  
the  
Bearkadette  
Ball  
and  
a  
winter  >ARGM-TMP
party*  
for  
Cotillion  <ARGM-GOL
.  

I  >ARG0
believe*  
that  
these  >ARG1
are*  
three  
weekends  <ARG2
in  
a  
row  
,  
January  
6  
,  
13  
and  
20th  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
the  
last  
weekend  >ARG1
in  
January  
would  >ARGM-MOD
work*  
well  <ARGM-MNR
(  
and  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
a  
rest*  
from  
formal  
affairs  <ARGM-ADJ
!  
)  
.  

Does*  
that  >ARG1
work*  
for  
you  <ARG2
?  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
do*  
you  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
do*  
it  <ARG1
on  
a  
Saturday  <ARGM-TMP
or  
Sunday  
?  

Saturday  >ARG1
probably  >ARGM-ADV
works*  
better  <ARGM-ADV
for  
me  
,  
just  
so  
that  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
back  <ARG2
in  
Houston  
and  
doing*  
laundry  <ARG1
by  
Sunday  
afternoon  <ARGM-TMP
!!  

Hi  
...  

Talked*  
to  
the  
little  
mother  
-  
to  
-  
be  <ARG2
.  

She  >ARG0
said*  
a  
shower*  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
grand  <ARG2
.  

She  
has*  >ARGM-LVB
some  
big  >ARGM-ADJ
presentation*  
mid-January  
.  

How  >>ARG2
does*  
late  
January  >ARG1
sound*  
to  
you  <ARG3
.  

Should  >ARGM-MOD
we  >ARG0
set*  
a  
date  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
?  

Am*  
I  >ARG1
turning*  
into  
Mother  <ARG2
?  

Cindy  

I  >ARG0
think*  
that  
it  
is*  
a  
great  
idea  <ARG2
to  
get*  
some  
press  <ARG1
regarding  
our  
fundamental  
operating  
standards  
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
wonder*  
about  
the  
most  
appropriate  >ARGM-ADJ
timing*  
,  
enough  
of  
a  
global  
message  
and  
the  
means  
of  
delivery*  
.  

On  
the  
means  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
delivery*  
,  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure*  
from  
your  
note  <ARGM-DIR
whether  
or  
not  
I  >ARG0
fully  >ARGM-EXT
understand*  
the  
intent  <ARG1
.  

Is*  
there  
an  
article  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
included*  
in  
an  
Enron  >ARG0
publication*  
and  
in  
addition*  
a  
letter  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
sent*  
under  
John  
's  
name  <ARGM-MNR
(  
if  
so  
,  
to  
whom  >>ARG2
will  >>ARGM-MOD
the  
letter  >>ARG1
be*  
sent*  
)  
?  

Or  
is*  
the  
letter  <ARG1
from  
John  
an  
introduction*  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
included*  
as  
a  
lead*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
to  
the  
article  <ARG4
?  

With  
regard*  >ARGM-ADV
to  
a  
global  
message  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
think*  
that  
one  >ARG1
of  
the  
key  
points  
around  
fundamental  
operating  
standards  
are*  
that  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
intended*  
to  
be*  
global  <ARG2
in  
nature  <ARGM-MNR
,  
applied*  
to  
every  
commodity  <ARG2
and  
every  
location  >ARGM-LOC
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
we  >ARG0
engage*  
in  
trading  
activities  <ARG2
.  

With  >>ARGM-ADV
these  
operating  
standards  >ARG1
implemented*  
worldwide  <ARGM-LOC
,  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
know*  
as  
operations  
professionals  <ARG2
that  
risk*  >>ARG1
is*  
being*  
mitigated*  
and  
we  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
ensure*  
Enron  >ARG1
top  >ARGM-ADJ
management*  
that  
there  
is*  
consistency  <ARG1
in  
operating  
standards  
worldwide  <ARGM-LOC
.  

These  
global  
standards  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
should  >ARGM-MOD
enable*  
Enron  >ARG0
to  
expand*  
its  
business  
reach  <ARG1
more  
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
,  
with  
well  
defined  >ARGM-ADJ
requirements*  
with  
regard*  
to  
trading  >ARG1
operations*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure*  
from  
the  
article  <ARGM-DIR
as  
written*  
that  
the  
global  
nature  >>ARG1
of  
this  
effort*  
comes*  
across  
.  

Finally  
,  
a  
question  
regarding  
timing*  
.  

The  
last  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
knew*  
after  
you  >ARG0
and  
Brent  
drafted*  
this  
starting  
point  <ARG1
for  
fundamental  
operating  
standards  
was*  
that  
this  >>ARG1
was*  
being*  
circulated*  
(  
Shona  >ARG0
took*  
this  >ARG1
to  
do*  
after  
Brent  >ARG1
's  
return*  
to  
Houston  <ARG4
)  
for  
comments*  
to  
all  
business  
controllers  <<ARGM-GOL
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
believe*  
that  
we  >ARG1
are*  
quite  <ARGM-ADV
at  
the  
point  >ARGM-ADV
that  >R-ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
that  
all  
business  
controllers  >>ARG0
worldwide  
have*  
reviewed*  
,  
understand*  
and  
have*  
implemented*  
these  
standards  <ARG1
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
belittle*  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
process*  
of  
creating*  
the  
standards  <ARG1
,  
the  
tough  
part  >ARG1
(  
and  
the  
real  
meat  
behind  
this  
)  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
an  
effective  >ARGM-ADJ
exception  >ARGM-ADJ
report*  
on  
a  
global  
basis  <ARG1
against  
these  
standards  <ARGM-ADV
.  

My  >ARG1
commitment*  >ARG1
to  
Rick  <ARG2
Causey  
is*  
that  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
that  
global  >ARGM-ADJ
report*  
in  
production*  
by  
the  
end*  
of  
the  
year  <ARG1
.  

There  
is*  
much  >ARGM-ADJ
work*  >ARGM-PRR
to  
do*  
in  
defining*  
the  
content  <ARG1
and  
regularity  
of  
the  
report*  
and  
even  >ARGM-ADJ
more  >ARGM-ADJ
work*  >ARGM-PRR
to  
do*  
to  
identify*  
reliable  
sources  <ARG1
of  
data  
for  
compiling*  
the  
report*  
.  

Shona  >>ARG0
has*  
commissioned*  
Mike  >ARG0
Moscoso  
to  
work*  
on  
this  <ARG1
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
believe*  
that  
Mike  >>ARG0
has*  
already  >>ARGM-TMP
been*  
working*  
with  
James  <ARG3
New  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
question*  
whether  
or  
not  
you  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
publish*  
info  <ARG1
about  
fundamental  
standards  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
yet  >ARGM-TMP
report*  
against  <C-ARG1
.  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
a  
more  
appropriate  
time  >ARG1
be*  
after  
the  
Global  
Operations  
Controller  >ARG0
meeting*  >ARGM-TMP
in  
October  <ARGM-TMP
when  >R-ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
worldwide  
buy  
-  
in  <ARG1
and  
commitment*  
to  
these  
standards  <ARG2
and  
(  
hopefully  
)  
our  
first  
draft  
of  
a  
meaningful  >ARGM-ADJ
exception  >ARGM-ADJ
report*  
?  

Sorry  
that  
this  
response*  >>ARG1
looks*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
long*  
.  

I  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
interrupted*  
20  
times  <ARGM-TMP
while  
responding*  
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
hope*  
that  
it  >>ARG1
makes*  >ARGM-LVB
sense*  
.  

Thanks*  
for  
sharing*  
this  <ARG1
with  
me  <ARG2
.  

Since  
you  >ARG0
asked*  >>ARGM-CAU
for  
input*  
,  
I  >ARG0
hope*  
that  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
mind*  
that  
I  >ARG0
gave*  
you  <ARG2
some  <ARG1
.

Steve  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
noticed*  
that  
our  >ARG0
allocation*  >>ARG1
from  
2000  <ARGM-TMP
to  
2001  
is*  
going*  
up  <ARGM-DIR

21  
%  <ARG2

(  
ie  
)  
$  
13.9  
M  
from  
$  
11.5

We  >>ARG0

able*  
to  
keep*  
ENA  
's  
direct  
group  
expenses  >ARG1
flat*  
year  <<ARGM-TMP
on

,  
we  >>ARG0

trying*  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
to  
keep*  
the  
corporate  >ARG0

flat*

Do*

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
wanted*  
Sue  >ARG0
to  
hear*  
(  
she  >ARG0

so  
much  <<ARGM-EXT

.  

Thanks*

the  
comment*  
on  
the

In  
some  
respects*  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
the  
first  
panel  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
gone*  
much  
better  <ARGM-MNR
;  
everyone  >ARG0
thanked*  
FERC  <ARG1
for  
intervening*  
(  
though  
for  
different  
reasons  <ARGM-ADV
)  
.  

The  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
staff  >ARG0
reports*  >>ARG1
are*  
also  >>ARGM-DIS
looking*  
good*  
.  

Scott  >>ARG1
Miller  
has*  
been*  
a

At  
this

,  
our  >ARG0
IT  >ARG1

backpedalling*  
a

suggesting*  
they  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
overcome*  
the  
TIBCO  
and  
Terminal  
Server  
problems  <ARG1
.  

There  
are*  
still  <ARGM-TMP
four  
important  >ARGM-ADJ
issues*  
,  
however  <<ARGM-DIS
:  

IT  >ARG1
still  >ARGM-TMP
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
commit*  
to  
transferring*  
messages  <ARG1
across  
domains  <ARGM-DIR
.  

This  >ARG1
means*  
that  
messages  >>ARG0
initiated*  
at  
Corp  <ARGM-LOC
and  
intended*  
for  
the  
entire  
Enron

any

No

IBM  >>ARG0
agrees*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
use*  
their  
proprietary  
message  >ARG1
delivery*  
tool  <<ARG1
,  
WebSphere  
,  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
use*  
WebLogic  <ARG1
instead  <ARGM-ADV
.  

WebLogic  >>ARG1
is*  
required*  
by  
BackWeb  <ARG0
,  
although  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
designed*  
by  
a  
separate  
company  <ARG0
.  

HR  >>ARG0
,  
intended*  
to  
be*  
a  
key  
user  <ARG2
of  
this  
tool  
,  
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
use*  
BackWeb  <ARG1
because  
survey  >ARG1
responses*  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
made*  
anonymous  <ARG1
.  

HR  >>ARG0
has*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
purchased*  
a  
tool  >>ARG0
called*  
CONFIRMIT  <ARG2
that  >>R-ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
execute*  
anonymous  >ARGM-ADJ
surveys*  
.  

Messages  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
delivered*  
simultaneously  <ARGM-TMP
to  
all  
users  <ARG2
in  
the  
same  
domain  
,  
nor  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
they  >>ARG1
be*  
delivered*  
for  
two  
to  
five  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
after  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
sent*  
by  
the  
message  
administrator  <ARG0
.  

Another  
thing  >>ARG1
to  
consider*  
is*  
that  
these  
messages  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
set*  
to  
expire*  
and  
disappear*  
within  
a  
set  
period  <ARGM-TMP
of  
time  
,  
meaning*  
users  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
retrieve*  
them  <ARG1
and  
read*  
them  <ARG1
later  <ARGM-TMP
(  
as  
they  
can  
with  
e-mail  <ARGM-ADV
)  
.  

This  >ARG1
means*  
that  
I  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
away  <ARG2
from  
the  
office  
for  
several  
days  <ARGM-TMP
and  
miss*  
a  
message  <ARG1
entirely  <ARGM-EXT
,  
because  
it  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
expired*  
and  
disappeared*  
by  
the  
time  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
returned*  
.  

The  
plain  
fact  >ARG1
is*  
that  
a  
few  
members  >>ARG0
of  
IT  
are*  
pushing*  
this  
initiative  <ARG2
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
lack*  
commercial  
sponsorship  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
are*  
hoping*  
Corp  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
foot*  
the  
bill  <ARG1
for  
a  
pilot  >ARG0
which  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
allow*  
them  >ARG0
to  
fully  >ARGM-EXT
test*  
this  
tool  <ARG1
before  
implementing*  
it  <ARG1
company  
-  
wide  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
let*  
us  >ARG0
know*  
if  
you  >>ARG0
have*  >ARGM-LVB
additional  >ARGM-ADJ
questions*  
.

did*  
a  
story  <ARG1
on  
gender  
roles  
in  
Kuwait  
several  
years  
before  
the  
Gulf  
War  <ARGM-TMP

She  >ARG0
noted*  
then  <ARGM-TMP
that  
women  >ARG0
customarily  >ARGM-MNR
walked*  
about  
10  
feet  
behind  
their  
husbands  <ARGM-LOC
.  

She  >>ARG0
returned*  
to  
Kuwait  <ARG4
recently  <ARGM-TMP
and  
observed*  
that  
the  
men  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
walked*  
several  
yards  
behind  
their  
wives  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Ms.  >>ARG0
Walters  
approached*  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
women  
and  
said*  
,  
"  
This  >ARG1

marvelous  <ARG2

Can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0

the

Currently  >ARGM-TMP
Cargill  >ARG0
and  
Enron  
have*  
a  
15  
MM  
collateral  
threshold  <ARG1
.  

If  
possible  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
think*  
the  
cleanest  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  >>ARG0
to  
run*  
this  
biz  <ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
to  
put*  
a  
box  <ARG1
around  
the  
prime  
broker  
biz  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
operate*  
under  
the  
master  
isda  <ARGM-MNR
but  
could  >ARGM-MOD
set*  
up  
a  
mutually  
agreeable  
credit  >ARG1
support*  
annex  <<ARG1
for  
this  
biz  
.  

We  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
keep*  
the  
20,000,000  
line  >ARG1
referenced*  
in  
Schedule  
B  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
POA  >ARG1
agreement*  
.  

The  
line  >ARG1
in  
the  
POA  
is*  
a  
seperate  >ARGM-ADJ
and  
distinct  
measure*  
from  
the  
daily  
collateral  <ARG0
.  

The  
20  
mill  >ARG1
reflects*  
gross  >ARGM-ADJ
exposure*  
.  

Let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
if  
you  >ARG0
think*  
this  >>ARG1
is*  
reasonable*  
and  
workable  
.  

We  >>ARG1
too  
,  
are*  
open*  
to  
suggestion*  
as  
the  
Global  >ARG0
and  
Enron  
relationships*  >ARG1
are*  
very  
important  <ARG2

I  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
the  
prior  
e-mail  >ARG0
got*  
through  
to  
Kay  <ARG1

Are*  
either  >ARG1

you  
familiar*

this

We  >>ARGM-REC

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*

bust*  
any

Our

JWVS  

Hello  
Janice  
:  

I  >>ARG0
enjoyed*  
your  
recent  
e-mail  <ARG1
but  
was*  
sorry*  
to  
hear*  
about  
your  
dad  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
sounds*  
as  
though  
his  
health  >>ARG1
has*  
deteriorated*  
significantly  <ARGM-EXT
.  

These  >ARG1
are*  
always  <ARGM-TMP
difficult  
times  <ARG2
.  

As  
I  >>ARG0
watched*  >>ARGM-TMP
my  
mother  
and  
father  
's  
health  >ARG1
deteriorate*  
and  
ultimately  >ARGM-ADV
watched*  
them  >ARG1
die*  
,  
it  >ARG1
is*  
a  
very  
defining  
time  <ARG2
in  
our  
lives  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
we  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
very  
thankful  <ARG2
to  
have*  
such  
great  
parents  <ARG1
and  
to  
have*  
had*  
the  
privilege  <ARG1
to  
have*  
been*  
raised*  
in  
such  
loving  
homes  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Sounds*  
as  
though  
Eric  >>ARG0
has*  
done*  
very  
well  <ARGM-MNR
as  
SMSU  <ARGM-LOC
.  

He  >>ARG0
is*  
joining*  
an  
excellent  
company  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
delighted  <ARG2
to  
hear*  
that  
he  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
continue*  
his  >ARG1
education*  
working*  
toward  
an  
MBA  <ARG1
.  

As  
we  >>ARG0
are*  
living*  >>ARGM-CAU
in  
an  
age  >ARGM-TMP
where  >R-ARGM-TMP
intellectual  
capital  >ARG1
is*  
so  
valuable  <ARG2
,  
it  
is*  
important*  
for  
every  
young  
person  >ARG0
to  
obtain*  
the  
very  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
possible  >ARGM-ADJ
education*  
they  
can  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

As  
to  
our  
family  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
within  
the  
last  
ten  
days  >>ARGM-TMP
our  
youngest  
daughter  >>ARG1
Elizabeth  
was*  
married*  
to  
a  
young  
man  <ARG2
from  
Buenos  
Aires  
,  
Argentina  
.  

They  >ARG0
met*  
while  
they  >>ARG0
were*  
both  >ARGM-ADV
working*  
on  
a  
project  <ARG1
as  
lawyers  <ARGM-PRD
in  
Buenos  
Aires  <ARGM-LOC
.  

They  >>ARG1
're*  
currently  <ARGM-TMP
on  
their  >ARG0
honeymoon*  
but  
shortly  
after  
returning*  >>ARGM-TMP
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
moving*  
from  
Buenos  
Aires  <ARGM-DIR
to  
Miami  <ARG2
,  
Florida  
.  

This  
past  
Thursday  
night  >>ARGM-TMP
our  
sixth  
grandchild  >>ARG1
was*  
born*  
.  

It  >>ARG1
was*  
born*  
to  
our  
son  <ARG0
David  
and  
his  
wife  
Courtney  
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
a  
7  
lb.  
,  
10  
oz.  
,  
20  
inch  
little  
boy  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
have*  
three  
grandsons  >ARG1
and  
three  
granddaughters  
ranging*  
from  
about  
2  
years  <ARG3
-  
4  
months  
down  
to  
a  
few  
days  
.  

They  >ARG1
are*  
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
deal*  
of  
fun*  
.  

We  >>ARG0
are*  
doing*  
quite  
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
looking*  
forward  
to  
seeing*  
Ginger  
"  
Rees  
"  
Copeland  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG1
comes*  
to  
Houston  <ARG4
.  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
delighted  <ARG2
to  
arrange*  
tickets  <ARG1
for  
you  
and  
your  
family  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
you  >>ARGM-GOL
ever  >>ARGM-TMP
have*  >ARGM-LVB
occasion*  
to  
visit*  
Houston  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
hope*  
you  >ARG0
have*  
a  
great  
summer  <ARG1
.  

Thank*  
you  <ARG1
for  
your  >ARG0
recent  >ARGM-TMP
request*  
for  
Mr.  >ARG0
Lay  
to  
speak*  
at  
your  >ARG0
conference*  
.  

Unfortunately  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
do  
to  
Mr.  
Lay  
's  
schedule  >>ARGM-CAU
he  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
able*  
to  
participate*  
.  

Thank*  
you  <ARG1

I  >>ARG0

I  >>ARG0

One

for

,  
the  
economy  >>ARG1
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
faltering*  
on

Dow

a

place*  
posted

at

I  >>ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
want*  
to  
put*  
some  
steers  <ARG1

heifers  
up  
there  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
going*  
up  <ARG1

and  
having*  
the  
tractor  >ARG1
fixed*  
.  

Reggie  >ARG0
said*  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
pay*  
us  <ARG2
soon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
still  >ARGM-TMP
wants*  
the  
tractor  <ARG1
if  
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
hold*  
on  
to  
it  <ARG1
.  

First  >ARGM-TMP
come*  
,  
first  >ARGM-TMP
serve*  
.  

When  >ARG2
is*  
the  
wedding*  
?  

We  >>ARG1
're*  
set*  
for  
11/01/01  <ARG2
.  

Be*  
sure*  
to  
take*  
your  
sweety  <ARG1
out  <ARG3
on  
the  
balcony  
tonight  <ARGM-TMP
and  
gaze*  
at  
the  
full  
moon  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
was*  
sure  >ARGM-ADV
beautiful*  
coming*  
up  
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG0
used*  
to  
go*  
out  
and  
lay*  
in  
the  
pasture  <ARG2
on  
a  
blanket  <ARGM-LOC
and  
watch*  
for  
the  
space  
shuttle  <ARGM-GOL
.  

I  >ARG0
had*  
a  
couple  <ARG1
of  
hickies  
on  
my  
neck  <ARGM-LOC
the  
day  
after  <ARGM-TMP
and  
the  
guys  >>ARG0
all  
wanted*  
to  
know*  
if  
those  >ARG1
were*  
shuttle  >ARG0
burns*  
.  

Just  
jealous  
.  

My  
kid  >>ARG0
is*  
making*  
wonderful  
grades  <ARG1
and  
has*  
reassured*  
me  <ARG1
she  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
graduate*  
within  
the  
four  
year  
period  <ARGM-TMP
.  

She  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
has*  
some  
sort  <ARG1
of  
scholarship  
but  
I  >ARG1
am*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
for  
sure  <ARG2
how  
much  >ARG1
it  >ARG0
pays*  
.  

She  >>ARG1
is*  
going*  
to  
be*  
a  
kinesiologist  <ARG2
,  
sports  >ARG2
injury*  
therapist  
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
she  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
wants*  
to  
be*  
able*  
to  
touch*  
football  
players  
legs  <ARG1
.  

She  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
20  <ARG2
on  
11/03  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
proud*  
of  
her  <ARG1
.  

Cindy  >ARG0
said*  
Jaime  >>ARG1
has*  
grown*  
up  
very  
much  <ARGM-EXT
.  

You  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
e  
mail*  
her  <ARG2
sometimes  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
sure*  
she  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
hear*  
from  
you  <ARG2
.  

Jgerma5@aol.com  
.  

At  
any  
rate  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
be*  
careful*  
and  
be*  
safe*

You  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
listened*  
to  
Maw  <ARG1
,  
as  
long  >>ARGM-ADV
as  
you  >ARG0

shut  <ARG2
and  
your  
pants  
zipped  
,  
you  >>ARG1

be*  
alright*  
.  

Shucks  >ARGM-DIS
,  
guess*  
none  >>ARG0
of  
us  
three  
paid*  >ARGM-LVB
much  >ARGM-ADJ
attention*  
to  
that  <ARG1
.  

Oh  >ARGM-DIS

Jeff  >ARG0
Sherrar  
has*  
a  
new

some  
pretty

.  

There  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
two

I  >ARG1
am*  
half

you  >ARG0

I  >ARG0
sure  >ARGM-ADV

his  
style  <ARG1

writing*  
.  

His  
books  >>ARG1
are*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
hard*  
to

down  <ARG2

After  
the

What  >>ARG1
's*  
happening*  
?  

I  >ARG0
understand*  
you  >ARG0
have*  
a  
brand  
new  
truck  <ARG1
.  

Must  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
nice*  
having*  
money  <ARG1
!!  

I  >ARG0
need*  
2  
things  <ARG1
from  
you  
.  

1  
.  
I  >ARG0
found*  
the  
title  <ARG1
to  
the  
4  
wheeler  
and  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
going*  
to  
change*  
it  <ARG1
over  <ARGM-DIR
to  
you  
name  <ARG2
.  

What  >>ARG1
do*  
you  >ARG0
think*  
?  

If  
that  >ARG1
's*  
ok  <ARG2
,  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
do*  
you  >ARG0
want*  
your  
name  >ARG1
to  
show*  
up  
on  
the  
title  <ARGM-LOC
and  
what  
address  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
use*  
?  

2  
.  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
getting*  
ready*  
to  
divy*  
up  
the  
Dow  
stock  <ARG1
.  

How  
many  >>ARG1
of  
Dad  >ARG0
's  
shares*  
do*  
you  >ARG0
have*  
?  

Last  
thing  >ARGM-ADV
,  
send*  
me  <ARG2
a  
million  
dollars  <ARG1
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
tired*  
of  
working*  
.  

I  >ARG0
thought*  
we  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
had*  
cashout  <ARG1
,  
at  
most  
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
,  
before  
this  
June  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
remember*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
know*  
that  
most  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
time  
this  
plant  >>ARG0
was*  
not  
buring*  
like  
it  
did*  
in  
July  <<ARGM-MNR
and  
August  
of  
this  
year  
.  

I  >ARG0
say*  
we  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
keep*  
the  
dough  <ARG1
and  
go*  
to  
Mexico  <ARG4
.  

Hey  
guys  
,  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
please  >ARGM-DIS
ck*  
the  
Oglethorpe  >ARG0
deal*  
from  
July  <<ARGM-TMP
2000  
-  
Dec  
2000  
?  

Is*  
there  >ARG1
supposed*  
to  
be*  
a  
cashout  >ARG1
booked*  
in  
Sitara  <<ARGM-LOC
for  
these  
months  <<ARGM-TMP
?  

Oglethorpe  >ARG0
over  >ARGM-EXT
paid*  
their  
invoice  <ARG2
every  
month  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
believe*  
that  
Doug  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
the  
extra  >ARG1
was*  
for  
the  
cashout  >>ARG3
that  >>R-ARG3
was*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
invoiced*  
.

Hello  
-  

I  >ARG0
spoke*  
with  
Jeff  <ARG2
Hodge  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
regarding  
the  
additional  
language  <ARG1
from  
Peoples  
regarding  
Audit  >ARG2
Rights*  
.  

His  >ARG0
initial  >ARGM-TMP
reaction*  >ARG1
was*  
that  
their  >ARG0
request*  >ARG1
was*  
probably  <ARGM-ADV
reasonable  <ARG2
and  
in  
line  
with  
the  
spirit  
of  
a  
jointly  
owned  
L.L.C  
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >>ARG0
did*  
suggest*  
a  
couple  
slight  >ARGM-ADJ
revisions*  
to  
protect*  
Enron  >ARG1
's  
interests*  
.  

1  
)  
Highlighting*  
that  
information  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
only  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
provided*  
that  >>R-ARG1
is*  
related*  
to  
enovate  <ARG2
and  
2  
)  
that  
each  
designated  
representative  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
sign*  
an  
appropriate  >ARGM-ADJ
confidentiality  >ARG1
agreement*  
.  

This  
language  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
included*  
in  
the  
attached  
draft  <ARG2
.  

My  
goal  >ARG1
,  
however  
optimistic  
,  
is*  
to  
execute*  
the  
risk*  
policy  <<ARG1
by  
the  
end*  
of  
today  <ARG1
.  

Activity  >>ARG1
is*  
picking*  
up  
dramatically  <ARG2
and  
the  
fine  
line  >>ARG1
is*  
getting*  
further  
blurred  <ARG2
each  
passing  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Therefore  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
know*  
ASAP  <ARGM-TMP
if  
there  
are*  
any  
problems  <ARG1
with  
the  
draft  
as  
written*  
.  

Otherwise  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
sending*  
it  <ARG1
to  
Peoples  <ARG2
as  
our  >ARG0
final  >ARGM-TMP
revision*  
by  
mid  
morning  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Thanks*  
for  
your  >ARG0
prompt  >ARGM-ADJ
attention*  
to  
this  <ARG1
.  

Thanks*  
,

Can  >>ARGM-MOD
you  >>ARG0
please  >>ARGM-DIS
review*  
this  
additional  
language  <ARG1
to  
the  
risk*  >ARG1
management*  
policy  
(  
or  
circulate*

Jeff  <ARGM-GOL

?  

In  
light  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
CA  
regarding

,  
I  >>ARG1
am*  
slightly  >ARGM-EXT
concerned*  
with  
a  
blanket  >ARGM-ADJ
statement*  >ARG0
essentially  >ARGM-ADV
giving*  
Peoples  <ARG2
unlimited  >ARGM-ADJ
access*  
to  
information  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
that  
we  >ARG0
address*  
audit  >ARG2
rights*  
in  
the  
LLC  >ARG1
agreement*  
so  >ARGM-ADV
this  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
matter*  
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
if  
this  >ARG1
is*  
a  
right*  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
already  >ARGM-TMP

It  
is*  
less  
complicated  <ARG2
for  
me  >>ARG0
to  
initial*  
and  
fax*  
than  
to  
track*  
down  
someone  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
anything  <ARG1
about  
it  
and  
get*  
them  >ARG0
to  
initial*  
it  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
print*  
it  <ARG1
here  <ARGM-LOC
,  
initial*  
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
fax*  
it  <ARG1
to  
whomever  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
want*  
.  

Plus  
,  
I  >ARG0
work*  
with  
Janet  <ARG3
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT
so  >ARGM-ADV
she  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
some  
comfort  <ARG1
from  
that  <ARG2
,  
instead  
of  
having*  
a  
lawyer  >>ARG0
she  >>ARG0
has*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
dealt*  
with  <C-ARG1
initial*  
it  <ARG1
.  

She  >ARG1
is*  
very  
conscientious  <ARG2
about  
what  >ARG1
she  >ARG0
signs*  
,  
and  
who  >ARG0
initials*  
what  <ARG1
.  

Is*  
the  
attached  
form  <ARG1
the  
final  
final  
form  <ARG2
?  

Where  >>ARG2
and  
to  
whom  
do*  
you  >ARG0
want*  
it  >ARG1
faxed*  
?  

Thanks*  
,  

Kay  

Since  
it  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
Janet  >ARG0
signing*  >>ARGM-CAU
,  
it  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
probably  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
better*  
to  
have*  
the  
initials  <ARG1
on  
the  
pages  <ARG1
first  
.  

Either  
fax  >ARG1
or  
someone  
else  
works*  
fine  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
which  >>ARG1
is*  
easier*  
and  
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
coordinate*

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
working*  
on  
it  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Maybe  >>ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0
(  
Enron  
)  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
review*  
it  <ARG1
tomorrow  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
send*  
it  <ARG1
to  
FCE  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
meet*  
around  
10:00  <ARGM-TMP
.  

That  
way  >ARGM-MNR
,  
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
it  <ARG1
to  
them  <ARG4
in  
time  <ARGM-TMP
for  
weekend  >ARGM-TMP
review*  
.  

Does*  
that  >ARG1
work*  
?  

Kay  

It  
was*  
good*  
to  
hear*  
from  
you  <ARG2
!  

We  >ARG0
had*  
a  
nice  
Thanksgiving  <ARG1
here  <ARGM-LOC
too  <ARGM-ADV
.  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
funny*  
,  
because  
usually  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
's*  
just  <ARGM-ADV
me  <ARG2
,  
Mom  
,  
Craig  
and  
Danelia  
,  
and  
Danelia  >>ARG0
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-EXT
like*  
roasted  
turkey  <ARG1
or  
roast  
beef  
(  
not  
that  
she  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
it  <ARG1
to  
me  <ARG2
!  
)  
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
there  
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
just  <ARGM-ADV
the  
same  
joy  >>ARG2
in  
cooking*  
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
elsewise  <ARGM-LOC
.  

It  
was*  
good*  
having*  
the  
girls  <ARG1
down  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
played*  
a  
new  
version  >>ARG2
of  
Uno  
called*  
"  
African  
Uno  <ARG2
"  
that  >>R-ARG2
was*  
complex*  
,  
fast*  
and  
at  
times  >ARGM-TMP
,  
physically  >ARGM-MNR
challenging*  
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
for  
the  
meek  <ARG2
.  

It  
was*  
incredible  <ARG2
what  
a  
good  
player  >ARG2
Alena  >ARG1
was*  
.  

She  >ARG0
had*  
her  
cards  >ARG1
memorized*  
as  
well  
as  
everyone  <C-ARG1
else  
s  
(  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
play*  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
see*  
why  >ARGM-CAU
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
know*  
everyone  
else  
s  
hands  <ARG1
!  
)  
.  

I  >ARG0
expect*  
Craig  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
Mom  >ARG0
to  
see*  
his  
place  <ARG1
because  
it  >ARG1
was*  
messy  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
compared  
to  
my  
house  >ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >ARG1
's*  
embarrased  <ARG2
about  
his  
apartment  
.  

Then  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >>ARG0
's*  
got*  
so  
much  
stuff  <ARG1
in  
there  <ARGM-LOC
right  
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
that  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
he  >>ARG0
's*  
going*  
to  
fit*  
baby  
stuff  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
give*  
him  <ARG2
a  
6  
month  
lease  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
renewed*  
his  
lease  <ARG1
last  
month  <ARGM-TMP
because  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
3  
people  <ARG1
in  
that  
small  
apartment  <ARGM-LOC
.  

So  
he  >>ARG0
's*  
going*  
to  
have*  
to  
start*  
looking*  
for  
another  
place  <ARG1
.  

And  
his  
apartment  >ARG1
is*  
so  
run  <ARG2
down  
down  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
afraid*  
roaches  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
crawling*  
over  
the  
baby  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
guess*  
Mom  >>ARG0
is*  
going*  
to  
come*  
back  
down  <ARGM-DIR
sometime  
in  
March  <ARGM-TMP
or  
April  
to  
see*  
the  
new  
baby  <ARG1
.  

You  >>ARG0
'll  
have*  
to  
come*  
visit*  
to  
check*  
out  
my  
new  
house  <ARG1
.  

The  
upstairs  
"  
guest  
suite  >ARG1
"  
is*  
pretty  
neat  <ARG2
.  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
got*  
its  
own  
bathroom  <ARG1
and  
tv  
,  
and  
is*  
pretty  
cozy  <ARG2
.  

As  
far  >>ARGM-ADV
as  
the  
call*  >ARG1
with  
Uncle  <ARG1
Ben  
goes*  
,  
if  
he  >>ARG0
was*  
thrilled  >>ARG1
to  
hear*  
from  
me  <ARG2
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tell*  
by  
his  >ARG0
voice*  
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
a  
pretty  
stilted  >ARGM-ADJ
conversation*  
for  
both  <<ARGM-GOL
of  
us  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
guess*  
,  
it  >ARG1
's*  
a  
start*  
...  

I  
've*  
already  
made*  >ARGM-LVB
my  >ARG0
XMAS  >ARG1
plans*  
.  

I  >ARG0
leave*  
the  
evening  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
21st  
,  
my  >ARG1
flight*  >ARG1
comes*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
about  
10  
pm  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
leave*  
the  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
27th  
at  
6  
am  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  
's*  
good*  
chatting*  
with  
you  <ARG2
.  

Keep*  
in  
touch*  
!

Attached*  
is*  
the

Let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
if  
the  
notice  
information  >ARG1
is*  
OK  <ARG2
with  
you

If  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
get*  
it  >ARG1
signed*  
by  
Craig  <ARG0
Breslau  
today  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
bring*  
it  <ARG1
to  
you  <ARG2
for  
countersignature  <ARGM-PRP
.  

Thinking*  
about  
that  <ARG2
,  
what  >ARG2
's*  
your  
title  <ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure*  
you  >ARG0
have*  
the  
authority  <ARG1
to  
sign*  
documents  <ARG1
w/o  
special  
authority  <ARGM-MNR
...  

No  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
it  >>ARG1
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
mean*  
that  <ARG2
.  

Adding*  >ARG0
all  
the  
Enron  
"  
Specified  
Entities  <ARG1
"  
would  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
make*  
a  
default*  
under  
a  
financial  >ARG1
transaction*  
with  
those  
other  
Enron  
entities  <ARG2
a  
default*  
under  
this  
agreement*  
.  

Our  >ARG1
concern*  >ARG1
is*  
that  
we  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
any  
trading  
related  >ARGM-ADJ
defaults*  >ARG0
to  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
trigger*  
a  
default*  
under  
a

Thank*  
you  <ARG1

Russell  

Hey  
there  
yourself  
,  

Sorry  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
written*  
you  <ARG2
guys  
in  
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
to  
keep*  
you  >ARG1
properly  >ARGM-ADV
updated*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
indeed  >ARGM-ADV
checking*  
on  
flights*  
to  
Seoul  <ARGM-DIR
and  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
going*  
to  
go*  
at  
exactly  
the  
same  
time  <ARGM-TMP
as  
my  
parents  
.  

As  
much  >ARGM-CXN
fun*  >>ARGM-ADV
as  
they  >ARG1
are*  
,  
I  >ARG0
figured*  
we  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
do*  
some  
different  
things  <ARG1
than  
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
have*  
planned*  
for  
them  <ARG3
.  

As  
for  
Ted  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
things  >>ARG1
are*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
going*  
well  <ARGM-MNR
although  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see*  
him  <ARG1
at  
all  <ARGM-EXT
this  
week  <ARGM-TMP
(  
we  >ARG1
are*  
two  
very  
busy  
people  <ARG2
)  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
,  
we  >ARG0
had*  
a  
great  
laid  
back  
day  <ARG1
last  
Saturday  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >>ARG0
think*  
have*  
hit*  
that  
comfortable  
stage  <ARG1
...  
you  >ARG0
know*  
,  
not  
quite  
so  
formal  
about  
dates  
etc  
.  

In  
one  
sense*  >>ARGM-ADV
it  >>ARG1
's*  
great*  
,  
but  
it  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
makes*  
things  >ARG1
a  
lot  >ARGM-ADJ
harder*  
to  
read*  
.  

Anyway  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
sure*  
my  
Mom  >ARG0
told*  
you  <ARG2
guys  
but  
Travis  >>ARG0
and  
Kathy  
got*  
to  
meet*  
him  <ARG1
and  
I  >ARG0
think*  
it  >ARG1
went*  
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Hopefully  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
if  
we  >>ARG0
're*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
dating*  >>ARGM-ADV
come*  
December  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
and  
Chuck  
can  >ARGM-MOD
meet*  
him  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
come*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
to  
visit*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
planning*  
on  
dragging*  
him  <ARG1
to  
at  
least  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
U.T.  
games  
,  
I  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-DIS
have*  
to  
find*  
out  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
wants*  
to  
go*  
(  
as  
well  
as  
properly  >ARGM-MNR
prepare*  
him  <ARG1
for  
the  
Scott  
/  
Kelley  
/  
Parks  
/  
Wild  
Card  
gang  <ARG2
and  
the  
full  
-  
day  
affair  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
is*  
a  
U.T.  
game  <ARG2
)  
.  

Things  >>ARG1
in  
Houston  
are*  
good*  
and  
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
warm*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
went*  
with  
Emily  <ARGM-COM
and  
her  
Mom  
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
to  
see*  
the  
musical  
"  
Rent  <ARG1
"  
and  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
wonderful*  
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
going*  
out  <ARG4
to  
San  
Diego  
for  
the  
Labor  
Day  
weekend  <ARGM-TMP
to  
visit*  
Hoot  
's  
daughter  <ARG1
Julie  
.  

Needless  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
say*  
I  >>ARG1
am*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
excited*  
.  

Talk*  
to  
you  
guys  <ARG2
soon  <ARGM-TMP
,  

Susan  

Hey  
girlie  
,  

How  >>ARGM-MNR
are*  
you  >ARG0
doing*  
?  

Have*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
heard*  
from  
you  <ARG2
in  
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
.  

A  
little  
birdie  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
that  
you  >>ARG0

checking*  
into  
tickets  <ARG1
for

.  

Are*  
you  
really  
?  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG1
come*  
with  
your  
parents  <ARGM-COM
or  
separately  
?  

In  
any  
case  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >>ARG0
have*  
had*  
some  
more  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
do*  
some  
exploring*  
(  
and  
shopping*  
)  
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
have*  
some  
good  
ideas  <ARG1
about  
what  >ARG1
to  
do*  
if  
you  >ARG1
come*  
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
that  
we  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
stay*  
in  
Korea  <ARG3
when  >ARGM-TMP
your  
parents  >ARG1
come*  
and  
do*  
the  
whole  
base  
thing  >ARG0
(  
which  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
only  
a  
few  
minutes  <ARG1
,  
actually  <ARGM-ADV
)  
,  
but  
are*  
considering*  
going*  
to  
China  <ARG4
or  
somewhere  
during  
part  <ARGM-TMP
of  
Thanksgiving  
.  

We  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
whatever  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
want*  
want*  
if  
you  >>ARG1
still  >>ARGM-TMP
are*  
coming*  
!  

Let*  
us  >ARG0
know*  
the  
latest  <ARG1
with  
Ted  
and  
also  
with  
what  >>ARG1
's*  
going*  
on  
in  
Houston  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
,

Hey  
Tonto  
(  
a.k.a  
-  
the  
trusty  
,  
but  
silent  
,  
side  
-  
kick  
to  
the  
Lone  
Ranger  
or  
in  
this  
case  
the  
Big  
D  
)  

The  
play*  >>ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
good*  
and  
I  >ARG0
think*  
well  
received  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'd*  
forgotten*  
how  
blown  >ARG2
away  
I  >ARG1
was*  
by  
some  <ARGM-CAU
of  
the  
songs  
the  
first  
time  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
saw*  
it  <ARG1
in  
NY  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
cast  
members  >>ARG0
really  
have*  
to  
have*  
incredibly  
powerful  
voices*  
to  
pull*  
off  
a  
few  <ARG1
of  
the  
most  
poignant  
numbers  
(  
I  >ARG0
think*  
this  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
your  >ARG1
true  >ARGM-ADJ
calling*  
)  
.  

I  >ARG0
caught*  
the  
third  
day  <ARG1
of  
Corey  >ARG0
's  
Jeopardy  >ARG1
run*  
last  
night  <<ARGM-TMP
here  <<ARGM-LOC
at  
the  
office  
(  
yes  
,  
I  >>ARG1
had*  
to  
come*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
after  
the  
play*  
...  
I  >ARG0
love*  
my  
job  <ARG1
!  
)  
.  

Anyway  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
sure*  
I  >>ARG0
'd*  
mentioned*  
it  <ARG1
before  <ARGM-TMP
but  
yes  >ARGM-DIS
she  >ARG1
is*  
a  
very  
smart  
girl  <ARG2
.  

As  
a  
result  >>ARGM-CAU
of  
that  
,  
she  >>ARG0
has*  
managed*  
on  
several  >ARGM-ADJ
occasions*  
over  
the  
years  <<ARGM-TMP
to  
detract*  
from  
my  
enjoyment  <ARG2
of  
playing*  
Trivial  
Pursuit  <ARG1
or  
watching*  
Jeopardy  <ARG1
by  
absolutely  >ARGM-EXT
obliterating*  
me  <ARG1
(  
The  
girl  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
did*  
her  
senior  
thesis  <ARG1
on  
Trivia  
)  
.  

Kori  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
she  >>ARG0
saw*  
you  <ARG1
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
at  
Steak  
Night  <ARGM-LOC
and  
introduced*  
herself  <ARG1
since  
I  >>ARG0
failed*  
to  
do*  
so  <ARG1
the  
last  
time  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
went*  
.  

I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
let*  
you  >ARG0
know*  
though  <ARGM-DIS
that  
she  >>ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
offended*  
this  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
that  
you  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
spell*  
her  
name  >ARG2
right*  
in  
the  
email*  
-  
I  >ARG0
mean*  
it  >ARG1
's*  
such  
a  
common  >ARGM-ADJ
spelling*  
.  

So  
was  
Darren  >ARG0
there  
last  
night  
to  
meet*  
her  <ARG1
or  
do*  
you  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
think*  
they  >>ARG1
'd  >>ARGM-MOD
make*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
match*  
?  

She  >ARG1
's*  
a  
very  
fun  
girl  <ARG2
.  

Hope*  
you  
day  >>ARG1
is*  
going*  
well  <ARGM-MNR
and  
that  
the  
move*  >ARG1
to  
30  <ARG2
went*  
off  
without  
a  
hitch  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Good  
luck  
with  
all  
of  
the  
"  
fun  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
meetings*  
.  

Shorty  

--  
Due  
to  
the  
lack*  >>ARGM-CAU
of  
response*  
yesterday  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
beginning*  
to  
worry*  
about  
your  >ARG0
success*  
with  
the  
road  >ARGM-LOC
test*  
...  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
going*  
to  
assume*  
that  
you  >>ARG1
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
around  <ARG2
to  
it  
.

How  
was  
the  
play*  
?  

I  >>ARG0
forgot*  
to  
tell*  
you  <ARG2
that  
I  >ARG0
saw*  
your  
friend  <ARG1
on  
a  
re-run  
Jeopardy  <ARGM-LOC
the  
other  
night  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >ARG0
almost  >ARGM-ADV
called*  
you  <ARG1
but  
it  >ARG1
came*  
on  
at  
11:30  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Smart  
girl  
.  

I  >ARG0
ran*  
into  
Corey  <ARG1
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
at  
LW  <ARGM-LOC
s  
and  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
thinking*  
this  >ARG1
is*  
a  
girl  <ARG2
for  
Darren  
.  

Anyway  
,  
lots  
of  
fun  >ARGM-ADJ
meetings*  
today  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
talk*  
to  
you  <ARG2
later  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Maybe  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
ignore*  
the  
sentiment  <ARG1
of  
the  
quote*  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
sent*  
earlier  <ARGM-TMP
...  

I  >ARG0
think*  
you  >>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
adhering*  
to  
it  <ARG1
too  
faithfully  <ARGM-MNR
.  

At  
this  
rate  
we  >>ARG0
may  
have*  
to  
start*  
pinning*  
notes  <ARG1
to  
your  
shirt  <ARG2
to  
remind*  
you  >ARG0
to  
do*  
things  <ARG1
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
having*  
driven*  >>ARGM-ADV
with  
you  <ARGM-COM
on  
several  >ARGM-ADJ
occasions*  
I  >>ARG1
feel*  
confident*  
you  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
pass*  
the  
test*  
with  
flying  
colors  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

Keep*  
in  
mind  <ARG2
though  <ARGM-DIS
that  
if  
you  >>ARG1
end*  >>ARGM-ADV
up  
failing*  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
let*  
you  >ARG0
forget*  
it  <ARG1
(  
and  
,  
as  
we  >>ARG0
have*  
established*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
have*  
the  
memory  <ARG1
of  
an  
elephant  
)  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
keep*  
discussion*  
of  
me  <ARG1
to  
a  
minimum  <<ARG2
and  
just  >ARGM-ADV
say*  
that  
things  >>ARG1
are*  
well*  
on  
32  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Now  
back  
to  
what  >>ARG1
's*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
important*  
...  
you  
.  

Thought*  
you  >>ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
know*  
that  
the  
Dixie  
Chicks  >>ARG0
are*  
coming*  
back  <ARG4
to  
Houston  
Dec.  <ARGM-TMP
12  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
performing*  
just  
down  
the  
street  <ARGM-LOC
from  
you  
at  
the  
Compaq  
Center  <ARGM-LOC
...  
it  >ARG1
's*  
all  <ARGM-ADV
about  
you  <ARG2
and  
your  >ARG0
needs*  
.

AAAAAGGGHHHHHH  
...  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
found*  
out  
that  
I  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
take*  
the  
TX  
driver  
s  
exam  <ARG1
both  
written  
and  
on  
the  
rode  
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
a  
two  
day  >ARGM-TMP
process*  
and  
all  
because  
I  >ARG0
let*  
my  
CA  
license  >ARG1
expire*  
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
I  >ARG0
need*  
some  <ARG1
of  
your  
organizational  
skills  
.  

I  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
try*  
to  
run*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
and  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
test*  
this  
afternoon  <ARGM-TMP
while  
I  >>ARG1
get*  
moved*  
to  
30  <ARG2
(  
I  >ARG1
better  
not  >ARGM-NEG
fail*  
it  <ARG2
)  
.  

How  >ARG2
's*  
life  <ARG1
on  
32  
today  <ARGM-TMP
--  
well  
that  >>ARG1
's*  
enough*  
about  
you  <ARG2
let*  
's  >ARG0
talk*  
more  <ARGM-EXT
about  
me  <ARG1
.  

There  
is*  
no  
pleasure  <ARG1
in  
having*  
nothing  >ARG1
to  
do*  
;  
the  
fun*  >ARG1
is*  
in  
having*  
lots  >ARG1
to  
do*  
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
doing*  
it  <ARG1

alternative  <<ARGM-PRD

Direct  >ARGM-MNR

more  
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
than  
is*  
currently  >ARGM-TMP

Please  >ARGM-DIS
call*

Have*  
a

This

us  <ARG1
immediately  <ARGM-TMP

The  
least  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0

is*  
pass*  
this

Is*

I  >ARG0
think*  
it  >ARG1
's*  
a  
good  
idea  <ARG2
since  
the  
provisional  >ARGM-ADJ
application*  >ARG1
is*  
on

Travis  >ARG1
is*  
the

lawyer  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
has*  
taken*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
the  
patent  >ARG1
application*  
so  >ARGM-ADV
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
better  
ideas  <ARG1
for  
where  >>ARG2
the  
words  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
placed*  
and  
appropriate  >ARGM-ADJ

and  
feel  
(  
I  >ARG0

near  
the

We  >>ARG0

thinking*  
of

Can  >ARGM-MOD

Dave  

Does*  
it  
make*  >ARGM-LVB
sense*  
for

to  
set*  
up  
a

with  
you  >ARG0

from

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure*  
we  >ARG0
have*  
much  >ARG1
to  
tell*  
them  <ARG2

actually  >>ARGM-ADV

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
sure*  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
anything  >ARG1
new  
to

but  
if  
you  
do*  >>ARGM-ADV
that  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
fine*  
with

there

we  >ARG0
heard*  
about  
it  <ARG1

that  >>R-ARG0

will  >>ARGM-MOD

particularly  >ARGM-ADV

to  
the  
energy

I  >>ARG0

any

gentlemen  
,  

This  >ARG1
is*  
just  <ARGM-ADV
to  
let*  
you  >ARG0
know*  
that  
Emma  >>ARG0
gave*  >ARGM-LVB
birth*  
at  
week  <ARGM-TMP

on  
Friday  <ARGM-TMP
,  
6th  
July  
,  
to  
our

all  <ARGM-ADV
"  
fully  
functioning  <ARG2
"  
and  
very  >ARGM-EXT
well*  
-  
they  >ARG1
are*  
in  
the  
lowest  
level  <ARG2
of  
special  >ARGM-ADJ
care*  
(  
and  
they  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
in  
there  <ARG2
for  
another  
two  
to  
four  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
)  
until  
they  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
feed*  
properly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
maintain*  
their  
weights  <ARG1
.  

Emma  >>ARG1

Hi  
everyone  
,  

I  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-TMP
got*  
of  
the  
phone  <ARG2
with  
Hai  <ARGM-COM
and  
he  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
how  >>ARGM-MNR
to  
make*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
adjustment*  
on  
a  
day  
to  
day  
basis  <ARGM-TMP
in  
regards*  
to  
incorrect  
liquidations  <ARG1
but  
he  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
explained*  
this  >ARG1
is*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
to  
make*  
the  
daily  
P&L  
#'s  >ARG2
right*  
,  
if  
nothing  >>ARG1
were*  
done*  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
month  >ARG1
end*  
P&L  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
somehow  >ARGM-MNR
work*  
out  
because  
adjustments*  >>ARGM-PRR
would  <ARGM-MOD
be*  
made*  
.  

Does*  
this  >ARG1
mean*  
that  
for  
June  >>ARGM-TMP
and  
for  
a  
certain  
portion  
of  
July  
we  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
anything  <ARG1
and  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
make*  >ARGM-LVB
adjustments*  
on  
a  
going*  
forward  <ARG2
basis  <<ARGM-MNR
(  
and  
assume*  
everything  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
work*  
out  
at  
month  >ARG1
end*  
)  
?  

If  
this  >ARG1
is*  
the  
case*  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
someone  >ARG0
to  
walk*  
me  <ARG1
through  
June  <ARG2
to  
see*  
if  
the  
numbers  >>ARG0
did*  
really  >ARGM-ADV
work*  
themselves  <ARG1
out  <C-V
as  
there  
was*  
a  
large  >ARGM-ADJ
swing*  >>ARG1
in  
second  >ARGM-ADJ
order*  
on  
June  <<ARGM-TMP
29  
that  >>R-ARG1
was*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
adjusted*  
for  <ARG4
.  

Let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
if  
one  >ARG0
of  
you  
could  >ARGM-MOD
help*  
me  >ARG0
do*  
this  <ARG1
.

,  
this  
a

of  <C-ARG1

a

now  <ARGM-TMP

There  
was*  
a

made*  
in  
the  
coding*  
for  
the  
delta  
position  <ARG1

this  >>ARG0
has*  
somehow  >ARGM-MNR

up  
the  
liq

all  >ARG1

the

all

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
looking*  
closely  <ARGM-MNR
at  
the  
option  
liquidation  
problems  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
believe*  
that  
there  
might  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
sign  >ARG1
-  
flipping*  
problem  >>ARG0
for  
PUTS  
that  >>R-ARG0
's*  
causing*  
this  
whole  >ARGM-ADJ
issue*  
.  

I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
keep*  
you  <ARG1
posted  <ARG2
.  

Karim  >ARGM-DIS
-  
this  >ARG1
's*  
likely  <ARGM-ADV
the  
explanation*  
to  
your  >ARG0
other  >ARGM-ADJ
question*  
...  

I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
back  
to  
you  <ARG1
as  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
as  
I  >ARG0

more

hopefully

The  
post  
id  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
am*  
looking*  
at  <C-ARG1
for  
Calgary  <ARGM-PRP
is*  
11608  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
looking*  
at  
the  
option  
liquidation  >ARG1
report*  
and  
all  >ARG1
of  
the  
$  
65  
puts  
are*  
in  
the  
money  <ARG2
and  
the  
$  
75  
call  >ARG1
is*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
money  <ARG2
.  

Should  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
all  
the  
liquidation  
values  >>ARG1
from  
the  
beginning*  
of  
the  
month  <ARG1
be*  
a  
negative  >ARG0
(  
representing*  
positive  
liquidation  <ARG1
)  
for  
the  
puts  
?  

The  
liq  
value  >>ARG1
for  
the  
call  
is*  
CORRECT*  
.

all  <ARG1
of  
the

who  >R-ARG0

You  >>ARG0
have*  
all  
devoted*  
considerable  
time  <ARG1
,  
resources  
and  
spirit  
in  
the  
preparation*  
of  
this  
document  <ARG1
-  
and  
it  >ARG1
shows*  
.?  

We  
now  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
a

before  
the  
Commission  >ARG2

ratepayer  
advocates  <ARG1

commercial  
and  
industrial  
customers  
,  
electric  
generators  
,  
marketers

customers  
,  
municipalities  
,  
and  
retail  
mass  
marketers  
,  
among  
others  
.?  

While  
we  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
proud*  >ARGM-ADV
of  
our  
accomplishment  <ARG1
,  
we  >ARG1
now  >ARGM-TMP
must  >ARGM-MOD
turn*  
to  
the  
task*  
of  
getting*  
our  >ARG0
testimony*  >ARG1
ready*  
by  
May  
5  
deadline  <ARGM-TMP
.?  

Assignments*  >>ARGM-PRR

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
schedule*  
a

Attached*  
is*  
a  
rough  
draft  <<ARG1
of  
my  
talking  
points  
for  
a  
panel  >ARG2
I  >ARG1
'll  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
on  <C-ARG2
at  
a  
CEM  >ARG0
conference*  
in  
SF  <ARGM-LOC
on  
Thursday  
afternoon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Have*  
distributed*  
to  
Western  
GA  
team  <ARG2
(  
plus  
Steffes  
)  
for  
comment*  
and  
thought*  
you  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
some  <ARG1
,  
too  <ARGM-DIS
.  

Topic  
for  
panel  
,  
"  
PUC  
Priorities  
.  
"  

Goal  >ARG1
is*  
to  
(  
politely  >ARGM-MNR
?  
)  
refute*  
Loretta  >ARG0
Lynch  
's  
and  
Carl  
Woods  
'  
continued  >ARGM-PRD
assertions*  
that  
1  
)  
California  >ARG0
's  
move*  >>ARG1
to  
deregulate*  
was*  
based*  
solely  <ARGM-ADV
on  
ideology  <ARG2
with  
no  
basis  <ARGM-ADV
in  
fact  
and  
2  
)  
the  
solution*  >ARG1
is*  
to  
turn*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
the  
clock  <ARG1
to  
command*  >>ARG1
-  
and  
-  
control*  
regulation*  
.  

The  
FERC  >ARG0
order*  >>ARG0
tomorrow  <ARGM-TMP
is*  
likely*  
to  
alter*  
the  
points  <ARG1
somewhat  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Comments*  >>ARG1
are*  
much  >ARGM-ADV
appreciated*  
.

As  
we  >ARG0
discussed*  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
,  
Laird  >ARG0
and  
I  
spoke*  
and  
we  >ARG0
think*  
that  
the  
presentation*  >>ARG1
is*  
good*  
to  
go*  
for  
Thursday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
to  
update*  
the  
numbers  <ARG1
for  
the  
offer*  >ARGM-PRR
we  <ARG0
made*  
to  
S.D.  <<ARG3
last  
week  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

You  >>ARG0
had*  
mentioned*  
that  
you  >>ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
want*  
to  
include*  
a  
shaped  
product  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
considering*  
it  <ARG1
?  

Let*  
us  >ARG0
know*  
and  
we  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
add*  
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
make*  >ARGM-LVB
any  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
changes*  >>ARGM-PRR
you  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
make*  
at  
this  
end  
.  

My  >ARG1
flight*  >ARG1
gets*  
into  
S.D.  <ARG2
at  
at  
8:35  <ARGM-TMP
on  
southwest  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Best

Sandi  >ARG0
sez*  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
happening*  
at  
10  
AM  <ARGM-TMP
and  
it  >ARG1
's*  
renewable  
-  
focused  <ARG2

Dear  
Justin  

Marly  >ARG0
asked*  
me  >ARG0
to  
respond*  
to  
you  <ARG1
.  

As  
you  >ARG0
know*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
suffix  >>ARG1
ONLINE  
is*  
purely  
descriptive  <ARG2
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
used*  
by  
many  
companies  <ARG0
.  

Therefore  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
any  
trade  >ARG1
mark*  >ARG1
registration*  >>ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
incorporates*  
the  
word  <ARG1
ONLINE  
as  
a  
suffix  <ARGM-PRD
in  
the  
way  >ARGM-MNR
that  >R-ARGM-MNR
you  >ARG0
use*  
it  <ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
enable*  
its  
owner  >ARG0
to  
prevent*  
others  <ARG1
from  
using*  
the  
word  <ARG1
ONLINE  
.  

Given*  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
above  <ARG1
,  
if  
you  
have*  >>ARGM-ADV
adequate  >ARGM-EXT
protection*  
for  
the  
word  >ARG0
ENRON  
(  
which  >R-ARG0
covers*  
the  
services*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
you  >ARG0
offer*  
on  
-  
line  <ARGM-MNR
as  
well  
as  
your  
core  
activities  
)  
,  
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
that  
another  
application*  >>ARG1
for  
the  
words  <ARG1
ENRON  
ONLINE  
is*  
probably  >ARGM-ADV
unnecessary*  
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
use*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
particular  
logo  <ARG1
for  
the  
on  
-  
line  >ARGM-LOC
service*  
,  
that  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
registered*  
.  

I  >ARG0
hope*  
the  
above  >>ARG1
is*  
clear*  
.

Marly  
,  

If  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
respond*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
me  <ARG1
on  
this  
request*  
,  
thanks*

Can  >>ARGM-MOD
one  >>ARG0
of  
you  
give*  >ARGM-LVB
me  >ARG1
a  
quick  >ARGM-ADJ
call*  
to  
discuss*  
.  

I  >ARG1
'm*  
@  
X37047  <ARG2
.  

Thanks*  
.  

I  >ARG0
believe*  
we  >>ARG1
are*  
to  
some  
extent  >ARGM-EXT
already  >ARGM-TMP
protected*  
with  
"  
Enron  >ARG0
"  
proceeded*  
with  
anything  <ARG1
,  
but  
EnronOnline  
(  
TM  >ARG0
)  
,  
etc.  
just  >ARGM-ADV
affords*  
us  <ARG2
more  >ARGM-EXT
protection*  
.  

I  >ARG0
assume*  
this  >>ARG1
is*  
akin*  
to  
why  >ARGM-CAU
McDonald  >ARG0

Paul  
,  

Can  >>ARGM-MOD
you  >>ARG0
please  >>ARGM-DIS
give*  >ARGM-LVB
me  >ARG1
a  
call*  
to  
discuss*  
trademarking  <ARG1
?  

i.e.  >>ARGM-DIS
Are*  
we  >ARG1
covered*  
if  
we  >ARG0
proceed*  
a  
word  <ARG2
with  
"  
Enron  <ARG1
"  
?  

e.g.  
:  
EnronEAuction  
.  

If  
we  >>ARG1
are*  
covered*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
was  
it  
necessary*  
to  
register*  
EnronOnline  <ARG1
?  

Thanks*  
,

Per  
my  >ARG0
conversation*  >>ARGM-ADV
with  
Edmund  <ARG2
this  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
,  
we  >>ARG0
are*

Below  >ARG2

to  
the

BC

which  >R-ARG0

the

so  
we  >>ARG0

BC

sign*  
the

with  
the  
rep  <ARGM-MNR
in

and  
this  >>ARG0
has*  
caused*  
much  
difficulties  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
going*  
to  
count*  
it  >ARG1
as  
signed*  
,  
since  
BC  
Gas  >>ARG0
has*  
signed*

but  
we  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
need*  
it  >>ARG1

Can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0

ASAP  <ARGM-TMP

It  
appears*  
you  >ARG0
missed*  
some

Tom  >ARG0

the

you  >>ARG0
probably  >>ARGM-ADV

them  <ARG1

I

I  >>ARG0

and  
he  >ARG0

that  
his  >ARG0

is*  
that  
all  >>ARG1
of  
the

will  >>ARGM-MOD

done*  
out  
of

I  >ARG0

The  
intention*  >>ARG1
of

in  
my  >ARG0
earlier  >ARGM-TMP

(

for

Despite  
the

of  
IT  <ARG0
,  
continuing  
problems  >>ARG1
with  
the

a

concerns*  
over  
the  
useability  <ARG0

such  <ARG2

sufficient  
accurate  
information  <ARG1
to

to  
satisfy*  
their  >ARG0
audit  >ARG1

-  
which  >R-ARG1
at

I  >ARG0
understand*  
how  >>ARG2

Furthermore  >ARGM-DIS

I  >>ARG0

's  
goal  >>ARG1

prior  
to

is*  
to  
be*  
100

confident*  
that  
:  
(  
i  
)  
the  
methodology  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is*  
being*  
employed*  
is*  
consistent*  
among

the  
inherent  
value  >>ARG1

This  >ARG0

during  
the

Article  >>ARG0

of  
the

Agreement*  >>ARG1
(  
which  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
am*  
sending*  
to  
you  <ARG2

)  
with  
ECS  <<ARGM-COM

ECS  >>ARG0
to  
"  
work*  
in  
good  
faith  <ARGM-MNR
with  
CDEC  <ARG3
"  
to  
establish*  
an  
automated

on

We  >ARG0
had*  
a  
pretty  
good  
idea  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
signed*  
the

that

able*  
to  
complete*  
that  <ARG1
by  
the  
contract  
start  
date  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
negotiated*  
a  
fall  
back  >ARGM-ADJ
plan*  
under  
which  
ECS  >>ARG0
is*  
obligated*  
to  
"  
assist*  
[  
Transwestern  <ARG1
]  
in  
developing*  
a  
manual  
system  >ARG0
to  
accomplish*  
the  
same  
result  <ARG1
and  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
hold*  
harmless*  
and  
keep*  
[  
Transwestern  <ARG1

whole  <ARG2
for  
all  
cost  >ARG1
and  
expenses  
"  
associated*  
with  
the  
manual  
system  <ARG2
.  

We  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
fight*  
with  
them  <ARG1
about  
who  >ARG0
owes*  
the  
$  >ARG1
200  
k  
that  >R-ARG1
James  >ARG0
mentions*  
below  <ARGM-LOC
based  
on  
their  
failure  <<ARGM-CAU
to  
"  
assist*  
"  
us  <ARG1
in  
managing*  
the  
cost  <ARG1
.  

In  
the  
mean  
time  >ARGM-TMP
,  
we  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
make*  
sure*  
that  
we  >>ARG0
are*  
doing*  
everything  <ARG1
we  
can  
to  
get*  
a  
handle*  
on  
the  
situation  <ARG1
to

Do*  
we  >ARG0
have*  
someone  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
is*  
watching*  
this  <ARG1
out  
there  <ARGM-LOC
?  

We  >>ARG0
are*  
running*  
so  
full  
tilt  <ARGM-EXT
on  
TW  <ARG4
that  
we  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
as  
much  
flexibiltiy  <ARG1
to  
manage*  
this  
situation  <ARG1
as  
we  >ARG0
expected*  
,  
but  
let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
what  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
.  

James  >>ARG0
had*  
heard*  
that  
one  
hold  
up*  >ARG1
was*  
the  
absence*  
of  
a  
confidentiality  >ARG1
agreement*  >>ARG0
--  
I  >ARG0
guess*  
between  
ECS  <ARG1
and  
Transwestern  
--  
that  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
permit*  
ECS  >ARG0
to  
communicate*  
to  
us  <ARG2
the  
details  <ARG1
on  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
access*  
teh  
key  
info.  <ARG1
from  
CDEC  <ARGM-DIR
.  

That  >ARG1
sounds*  
like  
a  
BS  >ARGM-ADJ
excuse*  
from  
ECS  <ARG0
,  
but  
it  
that  >ARG1
's*  
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
are*  
saying*  
,  
let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
and  
we  >ARG0

out  
a  
solution*  
.

Would  >>ARGM-MOD
you  >>ARG0
please  >>ARGM-DIS
contact*  
Gerald  <ARG1
Nemec  
and  
review*  
the  
Gallup  
Compression  
Service  
Contract  <ARG1
in  
respect*  
to  
the  
Load  >ARG1
Control*  >ARG1
Management*  
.  

My  >ARG0
understanding*  >ARG1
was*  
that  
ECS  >>ARG0
was*  
to  
provide*  
a  
means  >ARGM-MNR
to  
access*  
CDEC  
's  
online  
profile  <ARG1
in  
order  
for  
us  >>ARG0
to  
make*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
decision*  
to  
avoid*  
running*  
the  
compressor  <ARG1
during  
CDEC  
's  
peak  
load  
periods  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG0
have*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
received*  
access*  
to  
this  
information  <ARG1
which  >>ARG1
has*  
resulted*  
so  
far  <ARGM-TMP
in  
additional  
electric  
cost  <ARG2
of  
$  
200,987.33  
for  
the  
period  <ARGM-TMP
of  
July  
through  
September  
.  

Additional  
cost  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
incurred*  
for  
the  
remainder  <ARGM-TMP
of  
this  
year  
,  
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
not  >>ARGM-NEG
been*  
able*  
to  
review*  
yet  <ARGM-TMP
.  

This  
cost  >>ARG1
is*  
averaging*  
$  <ARG2
79,000  
per  
month  
if  
we  >>ARG0
continue*  
to  
run*  
the  
compressor  <ARG1
as  
we  
have*  
in  
August  <<ARGM-ADV
and  
September  
.  

Good  
point  
,  
but  
I  >ARG1
'm*  
comfortable  <ARG2
we  >>ARG1
're*  
covered*  
because  
our  
bidders  >>ARG0
were*  
all  >ARGM-ADV
bidding*  
on  
a  
chunk  <ARG1
of  
capacity  
and  
primary  
points  
.  

They  >>ARG1
are*  
deemed*  
to  
be*  
on  
notice*  
that  
they  >ARG0
had*  
alternate  
point  >ARG2
rights*  
(  
it  >ARG1
s*  
in  
the  
tariff*  
)  
and  
if  
they  >>ARG0
wanted*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
submit*  
a  
bid*  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
had*  
a  
different  
rate  <ARG1
for  
primaries  
and  
alternates  
,  
they  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
done*  
so  <ARG1
.  

None  
of  
them  
did*  
,  
and  
most  
importantly  
,  
the  
winning  
bidders  
did*  
not  
.  

Our  >ARG0
letter  >ARG1
agreement*  >ARG0
simply  >ARGM-ADV
memorializes*  
that  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
charge*  
the  
same  
negotiated  
rate  <ARG1
whether  
the  
gas  >ARG1
flows*  
on  
primaries  <ARGM-LOC
or  
alternates  
.  

I  >ARG0
assume*  
from  
your  
message  <ARGM-CAU
you  >ARG1
are*  
OK  <ARG2
with  
this  
and  
they  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
it  >ARG1
nailed*  
down  
?  

DF  

I  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-TMP
got*  
done*  
looking*  
at  
the  
underlying  
contract  
language  <ARG1
as  
set*  
forth  
in  
the  
pro  >ARGM-ADJ
forma  
service  >ARG1
agreement*  
in  
the  
tariff*  
and  
it  >ARG0
specifically  >ARGM-MNR
says*  
that  
the  
max  
rate  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
apply*  
unless  
a  
discount*  >>ARG1
or  
negotiated  
rate  
has*  
been*  
agreed*  
to  <C-ARG1
.  

My  >ARG1
concern*  >>ARG1
with  
adding*  
the  
language  <ARG1
below  
is*  
,  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
it  
be*  
argued*  
that  
not  
everyone  >ARG0
knew*  
the  
rate  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
or  
could  >ARGM-MOD
apply*  
at  
any  
point  <ARGM-TMP
,  
since  
we  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
stated*  
Topack  <ARG1
and  
Needles  
and  
if  
they  >ARG0
knew*  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
bid*  
a  
different  
rate  <ARG2
??

After  
discussions*  >ARGM-TMP
with  
the  
commercial  
group  <ARG2
I  >ARG0
propose*  
that  
that  
redlined  
language  >>ARG1
be*  
added*  
to  
the  
attached  >ARGM-PRD
Dynegy  >ARG0
agreement*  
and  
to  
the  
4  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
negotiated  
rate  >ARG1
agreements*  >>ARG1
we  >>ARG0
've*  
done*  
.  

If  
there  
are*  >>ARGM-ADV
any  
objections*  
you  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
get*  
back  
to  
me  <ARG1
ASAP  <ARGM-TMP
.  

pls  >ARGM-DIS
print*

df  

In  
discussion*  >ARGM-ADV
with  
Dave  <ARG2
,  
we  >ARG0
thought*  
it  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
good*  
to  
put*  
this  <ARG1
together  <ARG2
in  
a  
format  <ARGM-MNR
of  
questions*  
and  
answers*  
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
as  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
see*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
questions*  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
thought*  
of  <C-ARG1
got*  
kinda  >ARGM-EXT
long*  
-  
but  
I  >ARG0
think*  
we  >ARG0
need*  
answers*  
for  
all  <ARG1
of  
them  
.  

One  
thought*  >ARG1
is*  
to  
have*  
just  
the  
agenda  <ARG1
as  
a  
couple  
topics  <ARGM-PRD
and

a

of  
the

letter  >>ARG1

dated*  
Jan  <ARG2

that  >R-ARG1
MKM

intercepted*

the  
Sommer  <ARG1
letter  
to  
Stan  <ARG2
and  
discussed*  
it  <ARG1
with  
him  <ARG2
.  

Dari  >>ARG0
and  
I  
vented*  
our  >ARG1
aggravation*  
by  
drafting*  
the  
attached  
letter  >ARG0
to  
Gibson  
and  
Kyle  
complaining*  
of  
Sommer  
's  
duplicity  <ARG1
,  
but  
after  
tempers  >ARG1
cooled*  >ARGM-TMP

MKM  >>ARG0

up  <C-V

the

Doug  >>ARG0

us  <ARG2

the  
necessary  
specific  
market  
information  <ARG1

We  >>ARG0

new  
commissioners  <ARG2

Ercot

seeking*  
resolution*  
.

definitely  <ARGM-ADV

responsive  <ARG2
to  
market  
participants  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0

articulating*  
the  
issue*  
,  
providing*  
specific  
examples  <ARG1
and  
proposing*  
the  
solution*  
.  

Grand  
-  
standing  >>ARG1

Those  >>ARG1

up  
with  
complaints*  
but  
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG

to  
specifics  <ARG2

Doug  >>ARG0

met*  
with  
the  
Chairman  <ARG1

have*  
had*  >ARGM-LVB

Thane  >ARG0
and  
I  
also  >ARGM-DIS

with  
him  <ARG1

Pat  >>ARG0
Wood  
made*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
phone  >ARGM-MNR
call*  
to  
Tom  <ARG1
Noel  
and  
told*  
him  >ARG0
to  
get*  
the  
Texas  
market  >ARG1
fixed*  
.  

(  
Even  
though  
he  >ARG0
has*  >>ARGM-ADV
bigger  
things  >ARG1
to  
do*  
in  
D.C.  <ARGM-LOC
,  
this  >ARG1
is*  
his  
legacy  <ARG2
and  
he  >ARG0
recognizes*  
that  
if  
deregulation*  >>ARG1
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
work*  >>ARGM-ADV
in  
Texas  <ARGM-LOC
,  
the  
repercussions*  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
global  <ARG2
.  
)  

Chairman  >>ARG1
Sibley  
and  
Chairman  
Wolens  
(

the  
Texas  
legislature

are*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
engaged*  
in

We  >>ARG0

been*  
working*  
with  
the  
State  
Affairs  
legislative  
committee  <ARG3

keeping*

There  
is*  
an  
Electric  
Restructuring  
Committee  >ARG0
hearing*  >ARG1
scheduled*  
for  
September  <ARG3
6th  
or  
7th  
.  

The  
forum  >>ARG1
is*  
expected*  
to  
be*  
invited  >ARGM-PRD
testimony*  
only  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

Those  >>ARG1

PUCT  
Commissioners  
and  
Ercot  
's  
Sam  <ARG2
Jones  
and  
Tom  
Noel  
.  

The  
hearing*  >>ARG1
is*  
focused*  
on  
the  
pilot  <ARG2
and  
we  >ARG0
have*  
an  
opportunity  <ARG1
to  
provide*  
some  
probing  >ARGM-ADJ
questions*  
for  <<ARG2
Wolens  <<ARG2
to  
direct*  
to  
Sam  <ARG2
and  
Tom  
.  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
that  
Sibley  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
candidate  <ARG2
for  
Lt.  
Governor  
,  
there  
is*  
more  
freedom  >>ARG0
to  
open*  
up  
and  
ask*  
some  
difficult  >ARGM-ADJ
questions*  
.  

Thane  >>ARG2
is*  
in  
Austin  <ARG2
on  
Friday  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
is*  
available*

I  >ARG1

be*  
on  
a

to  
Houston  
at  
8:00  
a.m  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
we  >ARG0
find*  
another  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
that  >R-ARG1
works*  
for  
us  <ARG2
to  
meet*  
?  

Thane  >ARG1

an  
Ercot  
PRS  >ARG0

Friday  <ARGM-TMP
from  
9:30  <ARGM-TMP

I  >>ARG2

Friday  >ARGM-TMP

...  
are*  
you  >ARG2
available*  
then  <ARGM-TMP
?  

You  >>ARG1
are*  
right*  
,  
we  >>ARG0
do*  
need*  
a  
formal  >ARGM-ADJ
plan*  
,  
Thane  >>ARG0
has*  
started*  
an  
initial  
draft  <ARG1

Walking*  >ARGM-ADV
out  <ARG2
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
,  
Kevin  >ARG0
Presto  
indicated*  
that  
there  
were*  
games  >>ARG1
being*  
played*  
in  
ERCOT  <ARGM-LOC
with  
the  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
market  >ARG0
rules*  
and  
prices*  >ARG1
in  
certain  
markets  <ARGM-LOC
were*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
reflective  <ARG2
of  
working  
markets  
.  

Enron  >>ARG0
needs*  
to  
use*  
this  
situation  <ARG1
to  
quickly  >ARGM-MNR
get*  
our  
viewpoints  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-DIR
into  
the  
PUCT  
and  
ERCOT  <ARG4
ISO  <ARG4
on  
what  >>ARG0
is*  
driving*  
these  
problems  <ARG1
and  
our  >ARG0
proposed  >ARGM-PRD
fixes*  
.  

If  
ERCOT  >ARG0
goes*  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
way*  
of  
California  <ARG1
-  
either  
due  
to  
market  
power  <<ARGM-CAU
or  
poor  >ARGM-ADJ
market  >ARG0
design  >ARG1
rules*  
-  
it  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
bad  
day  <ARG2
for  
deregulation*  
and  
for  
Pat  
Wood  
.  

As  >ARGM-EXT
important*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
new  
PUCT  
Commissioners  >ARG0
need*  
some  
help*  
right  
now  <<ARGM-TMP
in  
messaging*  
the  
market  <ARG2
.  

Let*  
's  >ARG0
get*  
them  >ARG0
to  
support*  
constructive  >ARGM-ADJ
solutions*  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
make*  
a  
real  >ARGM-ADJ
difference*  
.  

Jean  >ARGM-DIS
and  
Thane  
,  
I  >ARG0
think*  
that  
we  >ARG0
need*  
a  
FORMAL  >ARGM-ADJ
PLAN*  
on  
what  >ARG1
to  
do*  
over  
the  
next  
3  
-  
6  
months  <ARGM-TMP
to  
leverage*  
this  
situation  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
discuss*  
this  <ARG1
with  
you  <ARG2
on  
Friday  
am  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG1
am*  
free*  
at  
8

before  
Rick  >ARG0

You  >>ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD

to

As  
an  
outgrowth  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
meeting*  >ARGM-PRR
Leslie  <ARG0
and  
I  
had*  
with  
Scott  <<ARG1
and  
Hunter  
a  
couple  
of  
weeks  
ago  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
we  >>ARG0
have*  
begun*  
work*  >ARGM-ADV
to  
develop*  
an  
electronic  
tool  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
allow*  
us  >ARG0
to  
provide*  
ongoing  
summaries  <ARG1
of  
FERC  
gas  
activities  
,  
and  
possibly  
electric  
activities  
,  
in  
a  
format  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
linked*  
to  
the  
Fundamentals  
intranet  
site  >ARG1
used*  
by  
the  
traders  <ARG0
.  

We  >ARG0
envision*  
a  
format  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
provide*  
a  
brief  >ARGM-TMP
summary  <ARG1
and  
analysis*  
of  
the  
order*  
,  
filing*  
,  
etc.  
with  
a  
link  <<ARGM-ADJ

the  
source  
document  
as  
well  
for  
those  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
more  
detailed  
information  <ARG1
.  

This  >ARG2
would  >ARGM-MOD
replace*  
the  
paper  >ARGM-MNR
copies*  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
and  
your  
people  
are*  
currently  >ARGM-TMP
getting*  
.  

Many  
details  >>ARG1
remain*  
to  
be*  
worked*  
out  
,  
but  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
keep*  
you  >ARG1
advised*  
.  

In  
the  
meantime  >ARGM-TMP
,  
could  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
please  >ARGM-DIS
provide*  
a  
contact  >>ARG2
on  
your  >ARG1
side*  
with  
whom  >R-ARG2
we  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
discuss*  
technical  >ARGM-ADJ
issues*  
?  

What  >>ARG1

application*  >>ARG0
of  
recent  >ARGM-TMP
developments*  
in  
optimization  
theory  <ARG2

We  >ARG0
informed*  
Tana  <ARG1
that  
we  >>ARG0
made*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
change*  
in

to  
include*  
,  
"  
a  
division  <ARG1
of

.  

We  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
meet*  
in  
the  
near  
future  <ARGM-TMP
to  
discuss*  
the  
issues*  >ARG1

and  
trade  
name

If  
Sam  >ARG0
's  
description*  >>ARG1
below  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
GCP  >ARG1
procedure*  
is*  
correct*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
it  >ARG0
looks*  
to  
me  <ARG2
like  
something  >>ARG1
needs*  
to  
be*  
changed*  
.  

The  
difficulty  >ARG1
lies*  
in  
the  
fact  <ARG2
that  
the  
confirmation  
system  >ARG0
reads*  
the  
counterparty  
's  
name  <ARG3
from  
Global  
Counterparty  <ARG1
.  

Since  
divisions  >ARG1
of  
companies  
are*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
legal  
entities  >>ARGM-CAU
they  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
the  
power  >ARGM-ADV
to  
contract*  
in  
their  
own  
names  <ARGM-MNR
.  

If  
the  
correct  
legal  
name  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
in  
Global  
Counterparty  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
confirmation*  >>ARG0
goes*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
with  
the  
wrong  
legal  
name  <ARGM-MNR
on  
it  
seriously  >ARGM-ADV
compromising*  
the  
contract  <ARG1
itself  
.  

That  >ARG1
is*  
the  
source  <ARG2
of  
Tana  >ARG1
's  
concern*  
regarding  
the  
correct  >ARGM-ADJ
entering*  
of  
divisions*  
in  
the  
system  <<ARG2
.  

My  >ARG0
suggestion*  >ARG1
is*  
that  
Global  
Counterparty  >ARG0
use*  
the  
same  
name  >>ARG2
that  >>R-ARG2
the  
customer  >>ARG0
has*  
signed*  
on  
the  
EnronOnline  >ARG2
Password  >ARG1
Application*  
--  
my  >ARG0
understanding*  >ARG1
is*  
that  
the  
EnronOnline  
team  >ARG0
returns*  
inappropriate  >ARGM-ADJ
Applications*  
to  
the  
customer  <<ARG2
until  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
correctly  >ARGM-MNR
completed*  
.  

In  
this  
particular  >ARGM-ADJ
case*  >>ARGM-ADV
since  
the  
counterparty  >>ARG0
is*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
not  >ARGM-NEG
allowed*  >>ARGM-CAU
to  
transact*  
on  
EnronOnline  <ARGM-MNR
almost  
a  
month  
after  
sending*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
their  >ARG0
application*  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
understandably  <ARGM-MNR
upset  <ARG2
and  
are*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
complaining*  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
appreciate*  
it  <ARG1
if  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
this  
one  >ARG1
fixed*  
today  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
,  
if  
you  >>ARG0
have*  >>ARGM-ADV
any  
problem  <ARG1
with  
changing*  
the  
GCP  >ARG1
procedure*  
,  
please  >ARGM-DIS

To  
Whom  >ARG0
It  >ARG1
May  >ARGM-MOD
Concern*  
:  

Through  
TV  >ARGM-MNR
and  
newspapers  
,  
I  >ARG0
hear*  
constantly  <ARGM-TMP
about  
identity  
fraud  >ARG0

stolen*

.  

I  >>ARG1
am*

.  

I  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
following  >ARGM-PRD

for  
our

.  

Since

assigned*  >ARGM-CAU
an  
SAP  
identification  
numbers  <ARG1
(  
P  
number  
)  
and  
an  
HR  
number  
,  
could  >ARGM-MOD
Enron  >ARG0
as  
a  
company  
use*  
these  
IDs  <ARG1
instead  
of  
the  
SS

?  

This  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
safer*  
for  
all  
employees  <ARG1
.  

For  
example  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG1
am*  
concerned*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
buy*  
the  
monthly  
bus  
passes  <ARG1
and  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
fill*  
in  
my  
SS  
number  <ARG2

I  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
feel*  
secure  <ARG1
at  
all  <ARGM-EXT
to  
see*  
my  
SS  <ARG1
in  
so  
many  
databases  <ARGM-LOC
at  
Enron  
,  
especially  
when  
some

are*  
from  
third  
-  
parties  >ARG0
(  
out  >ARGM-DIR
-  
sourcing*  
)  
.  

We  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
use*  
our  
badge  
number  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
instead  
of  
our  
SS  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
your  
organization  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
help*  
the  
Enron  
employees  >>ARG1
feel*

about  
the  
safeguard  <ARG0

Michelle  

Michelle  
,  

Two  
in  
one  
day  
.  

We  >ARG0
understand*  
that  
the  
pipe  
fitters  >>ARG0
are*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
planning*  
to  
picket*  
the  
Lake  
Worth  
,  
Florida  
project  <ARG1
as  <ARGM-DIS
well  
.  

Our  
execution  
team  >>ARG1
needs*  
to  
get*  >ARGM-LVB
some  
guidance*  
and  
planning*  
for  
this  
picketing*  
should  >ARGM-MOD
it  >ARG0
interfere*  
with  
the  
progress*  
of  
the  
work*  
.  

In  
that  
respect*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
dial*  
in  <ARGM-PRD
Rick  <ARG1
Johnson  
and  
Olgletree  
to  
plan*  
and  
communicate*  
that  
plan*  
to  
the  
execution  
team  <<ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
the  
first  >ARGM-TMP
step*  >ARG1
is*  
a  
call*  
between  
yourself  <ARG0
,  
me  
,  
Mark  
Stubley  
and  
Mike  
Indivero  
.  

And  
then  
another  
call*  
with  
all  
folks  <ARG0
or  
a  
meeting*  
at  
the  
jobsite  <ARGM-LOC
to  
lay*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
the  
plan*  
.  

Barbara  >ARGM-DIS
,  
please  >ARGM-DIS
organize*  
a  
call*  
for  
Mike  <ARG2
,  
Michelle

Mark  
Stubley  
and  
me

I  >>ARG1

been*  
advised*  
by  
our

Mr.  
Joe

that  
while

Lake  
Worth  
Building  
Planning  
and  
Zoning  
dept  <ARG1
regarding  
our  
permit  
status  <ARGM-CAU
he  >ARG0
learned*  
that  
the  
pipefitters  >>ARG0
have*  
inquired*  
about  
permit  >ARG1
requirements*  
to  
picket*  
our  
site  <ARG1
.  

Apparently  >ARGM-ADV
the  
City  >ARG0
informed*  
them  <ARG1
that  
no  
permit  >>ARG1
is*  
required*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
heard*  
that  
the  
pipefitters  >>ARG0
have*  
established*  
a  
picket  
line  <ARG1
at  
the  
Payne  
Creek  
site  <ARGM-LOC
today  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
local  
legal  
counsel  >C-ARG0
to  
assist*  
us  <ARG1
in  
this  
regard*  
.  

Mike  >ARGM-DIS

I  >ARG0
understand*  
that  
Mr.  
Mike  
Croall

is*

I  >>ARG0
am*

for  
global

.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
a  
good  
starting  
point  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
currently  >ARGM-TMP
working*  
on  
guidelines  >ARG0
for  
Argentina  
which  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
address*  
both  
physical  >ARG1

financial

.  

Other  
"  
guidelines  >ARG1

exist*  
in

for  
the  
remote

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
exactly  >ARGM-ADV
certain*  
as  
to  
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
are*  
looking*  
for  <C-ARG1
.  

Obviously  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
foreign  
offices  >>ARG1
have*  >ARGM-LVB
issues*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
apply*  
in  
the  
US  <ARGM-LOC
(  
although  
LA.  >>ARG1
is*  
about  >ARGM-ADV
as  >ARGM-CXN
close*  >ARG2
as  
you  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
to  
a  
third  
world  
country  <C-ARG2
)  
.  

One  
thing  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
show*  
up  
in  
the  
attachment*  
is*  
the  
swap  
eligibility  >ARG0
issue*  
.  

Let*  
me  >ARG0

how  >ARGM-MNR

an

.  

I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
call*  
you  <ARG1
shortly  <ARGM-TMP

Joseph  >>ARG0
Manogue  
at  
Tiger  
called*  
me  <ARG1
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
to  
say*  
he  >>ARG0
had*  
finally  >ARGM-TMP
reviewed*  
the  
draft  
ISDA  
doc  <ARG1
with  
all  
agreed  >ARGM-PRD
changes*  >>ARG1
put*  
in  <ARG2
and  
lined*  
from  
original  <ARGM-ADV
.  

He  >>ARG0
faxed*  
it  <ARG1
to  
you  <ARG2
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
the  
original  >ARG1
Fedexed*  
overnight  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Hope*  
you  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
review*  
it  <ARG1
today  <ARGM-TMP
.  

S&S  >>ARG0
has*  
again  >ARGM-TMP
asked*  
about  
the  
gtee  >ARG1
and  
l/c  
wording*  
.  

They  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
anything  >>ARG0
from  
us  
in  
writing*  
confirming*  
the  
agreed  >ARGM-PRD

.  

Joe  >ARG0
asked*  
that  
you  >ARG0
fax*  
the  
revised  >ARGM-ADJ
gtee  >ARG1
wording*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
has*  
been*  
agreed*  
(  
I  >ARG0
believe*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
our  >>ARG0
agreeing*  
to  
reduce*  
the  
claim  
period  <ARG1
from  
15  
days  <ARG3
down  <ARG4
to  
5  
)  
and  
the  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
l/c  >ARG1
wording*  
(  
drops*  
the  
2  
day  
period  <ARG1
to  
replace*  
an  
l/c  <ARG1
with  
a  
different  
bank  <ARG2
if  
the  
first  >>ARG0
refuses*  
to  
pay*  
)  
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
we  >ARG0
talked*  
about  
these  
issues*  
earlier  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
Tiger  
's  
lawyers  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
get*  
everything  >ARG1
agreed*  
in  
writing*  
now  <<ARGM-TMP
so  
final  
docs  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
issued*  
for  
signing  <ARGM-PRP
,  
even  
if  
we  >ARG1
are*  
the  
one's  >ARG0
issuing*  
the  
gtee  <ARG1

l/c  
.

if  
I  >ARG1

There

Jeff  
-  

instead  
of  
suggesting*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
specific  >ARGM-ADJ
rate  >ARG1
increase*  
-  
10  
or  
15  
%  <ARG2
,  
I  >ARG0
think*  
we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
acknowledge*  
that  
a  
"  
modest  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
increase*  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
necessary*  
and  
may  >>ARGM-MOD
in  
fact  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
desirable*  
-  
but  
that  
the  
specific  
amount  >>ARG1
of  
increase*  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
reasoned  <ARG2
and  
subject  
to  
well  
thought  >ARGM-ADJ
out  
evidence  
and  
hearings*  
,  
not  
just  >ARGM-ADV
determined*  
by  
whim  <ARG2
.  

In  
general  
,  
we  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
overly  
prescriptive  <ARG2
at  
this  
point  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >ARG0
know*  
you  >ARG0
agree*  
with  
that  <ARG1
.  

Otherwise  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
think*  
you  >>ARG0
have*  
captured*  
the  
points  <ARG1
excellently  <ARGM-MNR
.  

We  >ARG1
're*  
in  
the  
process*  
of  
developing*  
a  
strategy  >ARG0
to  
take*  
us  <ARG1
through  
the  
next  
few  
months  <ARGM-DIR
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
while  
the  
(  
otherwise  
perishable  >ARGM-ADJ
)  
thoughts*  >>ARG1
are*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
fresh*  >>ARGM-ADV
in  
my  
mind  <ARGM-LOC
from  
the  
hearings*  
on  
Monday  <ARGM-TMP
and  
Tuesday  
,  
I  >>ARG0
wanted*  
to  
throw*  
out  
some  
observations*  
for  
discussion*  
in  
the  
days  <<ARGM-TMP
/  
weeks  
ahead  
.  

OBSERVATION*  
--  
The  
pressure  >>ARG1
to  
finger*  
somebody  <ARG1
for  
"  
price  >ARG1
gouging*  
"  
is*  
increasing*  
.  

The  
administration*  >>ARG0
is*  
hell  >ARGM-EXT
bent*  
on  
finding*  
a  
"  
fall  
guy  <ARG1
.  
"  

The  
price  >ARG1
spikes*  >ARG0
pose*  
real  >ARGM-ADJ
political  >ARGM-ADJ
risks*  
for  
Davis  <<ARG2
and  
he  >>ARG0
and  
his  
folks  
need*  
and  
want*  
an  
easy  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  
out  <ARG1
.  

His  >ARG0
press  >ARGM-GOL
release*  >>ARG0
following  
the  
hearing*  
renewed*  
the  
call*  
for  
"  
refunds*  
.  
"  

On  
my  
panel  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Loretta  >ARG0
Lynch  
asked*  
Reliant  >ARG0
and  
Duke  
to  
supply*  
her  <ARG2
with  
the  
details  <ARG1
of  
the  
contracts  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
cut*  
to  
sell*  
their  
power  <ARG1
forward  <ARGM-DIR
to  
marketers  <ARG2
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
Carl  >ARG0
Wood  
's  
remarks*  >>ARG1
were*  
extreme*  
.  

At  
the  
Barton  >>ARGM-LOC
hearing*  
,  
a  
liberal  
democrat  >>ARG0
(  
Filner  
)  
and  
a  
conservative  
Republican  
(  
Hunter  
)  
locked*  
arms  <ARG1
in  
calling*  
for  
refunds*  
.  

Bilbray  >ARG0
joined*  
the  
"  
gouging  
"  
band  
wagon  <ARG1
.  

The  
utilities  >ARG0
repeatedly  >ARGM-ADV
called*  
on  
FERC  <ARG2
to  
do*  
a  
"  
real  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
investigation*  
,  
with  
hearings*  
,  
testimony*  
,  
data  >ARG1
discovery*  
---  
the  
works*  
.  

On  
the  
positive  
side  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
FERC  
commissioners  >ARG0
lauded*  
Wolak  <ARG1
,  
his  >ARG0
analysis*  
,  
and  
his  >ARG0
remarks*  
on  
the  
panel  <ARG1
.  

Wolak  >ARG0
said*  
somewhat  
emphatically  <ARGM-MNR
that  
the  
nature  >ARG0
of  
California  
's  
market  
structure  
makes*  
it  <ARG1
impossible*  
to  
single*  
out  
a  
single  
participant  <ARG1
as  
the  
culprit  <ARG3
.  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
stated*  
that  
just  
everyone  >>ARG0
's*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
acting*  
in  
their  >ARG1
own  >ARGM-REC
self  >ARG2
-  
interest*  
,  
responding*  
to  
the  
screwed  
incentives  >ARG1
embedded*  
in  
the  
structure  <ARG2
.  

IMPLICATION*  
--  
It  >>ARG1
seems*  
prudent*  
for  
Enron  >ARG0
to  
understand*  
better  <ARGM-EXT
its  >ARG0
risks*  
of  
getting*  
fingered*  
.  

In  
the  
best  
case  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
clamoring*  >>ARG1
for  
a  
"  
refund*  
"  
subsides*  
.  

In  
which  
case  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
only  
cost  >ARG1
to  
Enron  
is*  
the  
internal  
cost  >ARG1
incurred*  
to  
understand*  
better  <ARGM-EXT
the  
risks*  
of  
getting*  
fingered*  
.  

In  
the  
medium  
case  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
investigations*  >ARG0
find*  
that  
Enron  >ARG0
(  
like  
others  >ARGM-ADV
)  
"  
played*  
by  
the  
rules*  
,  
"  
but  
the  
rules*  >ARG1
stunk*  
,  
and  
Enron  >ARG0
profited*  
at  
the  
expense  <ARGM-MNR
of  
California  
consumers  
.  

You  >>ARG1
're*  
right*  
,  
Sue  <ARGM-DIS
.  

Rates  >>ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
up  <ARGM-DIR
w/out  
declaring*  
the  
rate  >ARG1
freeze*  
over  <<ARG1
in  
some  
fashion  <<ARG1
---  
trying*  
to  
finesse*  
it  <ARG1
.  

Thanks*  
very  
much  <ARGM-EXT
for  
the  
comments*  
.  

Harry  
also  
had*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
comment*  
---  
do*  
n't  
specify  
the  
amount  
of  
rate  >ARG1
increase*  
in  
our  >ARG0
comments*  
;  
rather  >ARGM-ADV
note*  
that  
the  
rate  >ARG1
increase*  >>ARG1
needs*  
to  
be*  
well  
-  
reasoned  <ARG2
and  
based*  
on  
facts  <ARG2
and  
evidence  
.  

Will  >>ARGM-MOD
make*  >ARGM-LVB
that  
change*  
.

Tom  >>ARG0
Byargeon  
,  
Kevin  
Miller  
and  
Ken  
Loch  
in  
ENA  
are*  
working*  
with  
producers  <ARG3
in  
the  
US  
involved  
in  
deep  
water  
offshore  
Louisiana  
/  
Texas  
oil  
and  
gas  
drilling  
projects  
.  

This  
financing  
activity  >>ARG1
was*  
primarily  >ARGM-ADV
started*  
to  
help*  
ENA  >>ARG0
secure*  
long  
term  >ARGM-TMP
well  
head  >ARGM-MNR
and  
pipeline  >ARGM-MNR
natural  
gas  >ARG1
supplies*  
to  
supplement*  
the  
gas  >ARG1
trading*  
desk  
activities  <<ARG1
.  

Just  
like  
what  >>ARGM-ADV
happened*  
in  
Enron  
's  
initial  
VPP  
program  <ARG2
they  >>ARG0
are*  
find*  
more  >ARGM-EXT
interest*  
in  
oil  >ARG3
drilling*  
projects  <<ARG2
rather  
than  
natural  
gas  
projects  
.  

They  >>ARG0
are*  
currently  >ARGM-TMP
working*  
on  
a  
bid*  
(  
due  <ARGM-ADJ
1/31  
)  
for  
the  
Medusa  
project  >ARG0
which  >R-ARG0
involves*  
Murphy  <ARG1
(  
operator  
)  
,  
Agip  
and  
Callon  
in  
Mississippi  
Canyon  
Blocks  <ARG2
#  
538  
and  
#  
582  
.  

The  
initial  >ARGM-TMP
reservoir  >ARG1
reports*  >ARG0
estimate*  
reserves  <ARG1
of  
80  
-  
120  
million  
barrels  
of  
sour  
crude  
and  
they  >ARG0
estimate*  
initial  >ARGM-TMP
production*  >ARG1
to  
be*  
40,000  
bpd  >ARG1
starting*  
in  
1Q  <ARGM-TMP
2003  
.  

Quality  >>ARG1
is*  
estimated*  
to  
be*  
a  
Mars  
type  
crude  <ARG2
with  
25  
-  
27  
API  
Gravity  
and  
1.5  
-  
2.0  
%  
sulfur  
.  

Plans*  >ARG1
are*  
to  
build*  
a  
private  
pipeline  <ARG1
to  
Equilon  
's  
West  
Delta  
#  
143  
platform  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
bring*  
the  
oil  <ARG1
onshore  <ARG2
.  

Peggy  >>ARG0
is*  
finding*  
out  
where  >ARG1
WD  >ARG0
#  
143  
pumps*  
to  <C-ARG1
onshore  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Tom  
's  
group  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
know*  
if  
we  >>ARG0
have*  >ARGM-LVB
any  
interesting*  
in  
buying*  
the  
crude  <ARG1
on  
either  
a  
fixed  
or  
floating  
basis  <ARGM-MNR
.  

The  
floating*  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
tied*  
to  
a  
Platt  
's  
index  <ARG2
or  
the  
NYMEX  
.  

It  >>ARG1
is*  
far  
too  >ARGM-CXN
early*  
to  
expect*  
Murphy  >ARG0
to  
enter*  
into  
a  
physical  
or  
financial  
contract  <ARG1
,  
but  
Tom  >>ARG0
hopes*  
to  
get*  >ARGM-LVB
us  >ARGM-GOL
first  >ARGM-TMP
and  
/  
or  
last  
look*  
from  
Murphy  <ARGM-ADV
when  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
time  >>ARG1
is*  
right*  
.  

Another  
alternative  >ARG1
is*  
to  
give*  
Murphy  <ARG2
barrels  <ARG1
at  
their  
95,000  
bpd  
Meraux  
,  
Louisiana  
refinery  <ARGM-LOC
in  
exchange*  
for  
the  
new  
production  
barrels  <ARG3
.  

Could  >ARGM-MOD
someone  >ARG0
in  
your  
group  
please  >ARGM-DIS
give*  
me  <ARG2
a  
notional  
non  
binding  
basis  
differential  <ARG1
for  
this  
quality  
of  
crude  
for  
Cal  
2003  
?

I  >ARG0

We  >ARG0

following*  >>ARGM-ADV
up  
on  
our  >ARG0
discussion*  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
;  
for  
these  
types  >>ARGM-GOL
of  
deals*  
,  
i  >>ARG0
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
it  
s*  
necessary*  
to  
have*  
all  
the  
documentation*  
of  
our  
counterparty  >ARG0
's  
authorization*  
to  
enter*  
into  
the  
agreement*  
.  

these  >ARG1
are*  
short  
term  >ARGM-TMP
transactions*  
and  
requiring*  >>ARG0
this  
documentation*  
will  >ARGM-MOD
cause*  
us  >ARG0
to  
lose*  
business  <ARG1
because  
competitive  
alternatives  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
such  >ARGM-ADJ
burdensome  >ARGM-ADJ
requirements*  
.  

the  
primary  
reason  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
need*  
these  
things  <ARG1
is*  
for  
the  
scenario  >>ARGM-ADV
where  >>R-ARGM-ADV
a  
muni  >>ARG0
does*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
derivative  >ARG2
deal*  
with  
an  
open  
-  
ended  
downside  <ARGM-MNR
,  
loses*  
$  <ARG1
50  
million  
,  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
claims*  
that  
it  >ARG1
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
valid  
contract  <ARG2
.  

in  
our  
case  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
only  >ARGM-ADV
hedging*  
.  

we  >>ARG0
are*  
collecting*  
a  
premium  <ARG1
up  
front  <ARGM-TMP
and  
their  
total  
cost  >>ARG1
is*  
known*  
up  
front  <ARGM-ADV
.  

therefore  >ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
attempt*  
to  
make*  >ARGM-LVB
this  
claim*  
.  

even  
if  
they  
did*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
our  >ARG0
risk*  >>ARG1
is*  
limited*  
to  
the  
premium  <ARG2
,  
not  
some  
big  
payout  
.  

the  
risk*  >>ARG1
of  
losing*  
business  <ARG1
is*  
far  >ARGM-EXT
greater*  
than  
the  
risk*  
of  
a  
counterparty  >ARG0
trying*  
to  
get*  
their  
premium  <ARG1
back  <C-V
.  

seems*  
like  
a  
5  
second  >ARGM-TMP
decision*  
to  
me  <<ARG2
.  

is*  
it  <ARG1
possible*  
to  
combine*  
the  
standard  
isda  <ARG1
and  
our  
confirm  
into  
a  
single  
long  
form  <ARG3
?  

by  
going*  >ARGM-MNR
away  <ARGM-DIR
from  
the  
standard  
isda  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
eliminate*  
these  
requirements*  
because  
the  
payout  
liability  >ARG1
is*  
only  <ARGM-ADV
1  
-  
way  <ARG2

What  >ARG1
happened*  
?  

Here  >ARG2
's*  
a  
story  <ARG1
...  
as  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
waiting*  >>ARGM-TMP
at  
the  
bus  >ARG1
stop*  
(  
7:35  
am  <<ARGM-TMP
)  
to  
go*  
to  
school  <ARG4
,  
a  
lady  >>ARG0
approached*  
me  <ARG2
and  
asked*  
if  
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
make*  
sure*  
her  
daughter  >ARG1
got*  
on  
a  
certain  
bus  <ARG2
.  

The  
mother  >>ARG1
was*  
running*  
late  <ARGM-TMP
for  
work*  
and  
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
wait*  
.  

I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
say*  
no  <ARG1
...  
so  >ARGM-ADV
Nicki  >ARG1
(  
the  
little  
girl  
-  
10  
yrs.  
old  
)  
and  
I  
waited*  
for  
the  
bus  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
8:15  <ARG2
and  
there  
was*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
sign*  
of  
her  
bus  <ARG1
.  

On  
top  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
things  
,  
I  >>ARG1
had*  >ARGM-LVB
quiz*  
at  
8  
am  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Which  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
then  >ARGM-TMP
realized*  
I  >ARG0
missed*  
.  

I  >ARG0
decided*  
that  
Nicki  >>ARG1
would  
just  
have*  
to  
wait*  
on  
her  
own  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
asked*  
her  <ARG2
if  
she  >ARG0
had*  
any  
relatives  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
want*  
to  
know*  
of  
her  
whereabouts  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
called*  
her  
grandmother  <ARG1
and  
explained*  
things  <ARG1
to  
her  <ARG2
.  

Pretty  
strange  
...  
aye  
.  

A  
bus  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG0
runs*  
through  
UofH  <ARGM-DIR
arrived*  
and  
I  >ARG1
almost  >ARGM-ADV
got*  
on  
without  
her  <ARGM-MNR
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
it  <ARG1
.  

Finally  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
told*  
the  
little  
girl  <ARG2
that  
she  >>ARG0
would  
have*  
to  
accompany*  
me  <ARG1
to  
school  <ARG4
(  
8:30  
am  <ARGM-TMP
)  
.  

There  
were*  
only  
15  
minutes  <ARG1
left  
of  
class  
.  

I  >ARG1
stayed*  
for  
the  
remainder  <ARG3
of  
the  
lecture  
.  

After  
class  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
went*  
back  <ARG4
to  
bus  >ARG1
stop*  
and  
within  
minutes  >ARGM-TMP
her  
bus  >ARG1
arrived*  
.  

I  >ARG0
told*  
the  
bus  
driver  <ARG2
where  >ARG2
to  
drop*  
her  <ARG1
off  <C-V
.  

I  >ARG0
notified*  
her  
grandmother  <ARG1
with  
the  
time  <ARG2
of  
the  
departure*  
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG1
was*  
relieved*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
Nicki  >>ARG0
called*  
to  
let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
she  >>ARG1
was*  
home  <ARG2
safe*  
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
send*  
the  
memo  <ARG1
to  
the  
EGM  
business  
heads  <ARG2
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

Thanks*  
.

Carol  
:  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
attempted*  
to  
incorporate*  
the  
changes*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
Jim  >>ARG0
has*  
incorporated*  
in  
our  >ARG0
long  
form  >ARGM-ADJ
power  >ARG1
agreement*  
which  >>R-ARG1
ENA  >>ARG0
has*  
suggested*  
to  
date  <ARGM-TMP
into  
the  
short  
form  <<ARG2
.  

Attached*  >ARGM-PRD
please  >ARGM-DIS
find*  
a  
sample  
short  
form  <ARG1
(  
for  
the  
Con  
Ed  
market  
)  
for  
your  >ARG0
review*  
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
note*  
the  <ARG1
following  
as  
you  >ARG0
review*  
:  

1  
.  
The  
short  
forms  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
contain*  
the  
optionality  <ARG1
relating  
to  
our  >ARG0
performing*  
billing  >ARG1
services*  
--  
all  >ARG0
of  
our  
midmarket  
forms  
anticipate*  
that  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
act*  
as  
customer  
's  
billing  
agent  <ARG1
and  
that  
we  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
collect*  
all  
amounts  <ARG1
due  
related  
to  
T&D  
and  
the  
like  
from  
the  
customer  <ARG2
(  
and  
reflect*  
same  <ARG2
on  
our  
invoice  <ARGM-LOC
)  
and  
pass*  
those  
amounts  <ARG1
on  <C-V
to  
the  
customer  
's  
utility  <ARG2
.  

2  
.  
I  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
include*  
a  
"  
Setoff  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
provision*  
in  
this  
draft  <<ARG2
,  
mainly  
because  
the  
vast  
majority  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
time  
,  
we  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
,  
nor  
will  
an  
affiliate  
,  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
another  
agreement*  
in  
place  <ARGM-LOC
with  
these  
customers  <ARG2
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
feel*  >>ARGM-ADV
strongly  <ARG1
about  
our  >ARG0
including*  
a  
setoff  >ARGM-ADJ
provision*  
,  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
so  <ARG1
.  

3  
.  
The  
change*  >>ARG1
in  
law  >ARG1
provision*  
reads*  
a  
bit  
differently  <ARGM-MNR
from  
the  
long  
form  
--  
the  
thinking*  >ARG1
here  <ARGM-LOC
is*  
that  
the  
long  
form  
language  >>ARG1
is*  
very  
lengthy  <ARG2
and  
rather  >ARGM-EXT
harsh*  
(  
and  
we  >>ARG0
've*  
had*  
great  
difficulty  <ARG1
selling*  
it  <ARG1
in  
the  
past  <<ARGM-TMP
)  
.  

Taking*  >>ARGM-ADV
into  
consideration*  
this  
class  <ARG1
of  
customer  
,  
we  >>ARG0
decided*  
to  
include*  
certain  
items  <ARG1
,  
including  
our  
inability  
to  
cover*  
our  
costs  <ARG1
due  
to  
a  
change*  
in  
law  <ARG1
,  
rules*  
or  
practices  
as  
a  
"  
force  
majeure  
event  <<ARGM-PRD
"  
in  
an  
effort*  
to  
soften*  
the  
approach*  
(  
see*  
the  
GTCs  <ARG1
)  
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
we  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
address*  
calculation*  
of  
a  
termination  >ARG3
payment*  
in  
the  
event  <ARGM-ADV
of  
a  
change*  
in  
law  <ARG1
as  
the  
long  
form  
does*  
--  
again  
,  
more  
in  
the  
interest*  
of  
"  
saving*  
space  <ARG1
"  
than  
anything  
else  
...  

Let*  
us  >ARG0
know*  
your  >ARG0
thoughts*  
on  
this  
document  <ARG2
and  
if  
you  >ARG1
are*  
comfortable  <ARG2
with  
our  >ARG0
using*  
this  <ARG1
until  
such  
time  <ARGM-TMP
as  
the  
hybrid  
form  >>ARG1
is*  
launched*  
.  

If  
you  >ARG1
are*  
comfortable  >ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
drive*  
these  
changes*  
into  
our  
other  
midmarket  
power  
forms  <<ARG2

sorry

I  >ARG0

I  >>ARG0
'm*

that  
you  >>ARG0

already  >ARGM-TMP

Let*

Kim

Kim  

The  
in  
-  
service*  
date  >>ARG1
of  
May  
1  
,  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
difficult*  
to  
attain*  
.  

Since  
the  
bankruptcy  >ARG4
filing*  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
vendors  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
reluctant*  
to  
ship*  
material  <ARG1
prior  
to  
it  >>ARG1
being*  
prepaid*  
(  
Daniels  
,  
Fisher  
,  
Rosemont  
,  
other  
)  
.  

These  >ARG1
are*  
the  
vendors  <ARG2
of  
instrumentation*  >ARG1
required*  
for  
the  
interconnect  <ARG0
.  

Questar  >>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
purchase*  
material  <ARG1
,  
but  
some  
of  
the  
items  
can  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
up  
to  
a  >ARGM-TMP
60  
day  >ARGM-TMP
delivery*  
.  

(  
From  
time  >>ARG1
PA  >ARG0
approved*  
and  
funded*  
to  
in  
-  
service*  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
75  
days  <ARG2
at  
most  <ARGM-ADV
.  

We  >>ARG0
have*  
worked*  
with  
Daniels  <ARG3
on  
a  
chromatograph  <ARG1
on  
another  
project  
and  
prepayment*  >>ARG0
has*  
taken*  
45  
days  <ARG1
alone  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Daniels  >>ARG1
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
set*  
up  
for  
prepayments*  
as  
they  >ARG0
bill*  
off  
an  
invoice  <ARGM-DIR
and  
the  
main  
office  >>ARG0
and  
accounting  
had*  
to  
create*  
an  
invoice  <ARG1
for  
a  
chromatograph  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
had*  
not  >>ARGM-NEG
been*  
delivered*  
.  

Not  
the  
usual  
mode  
of  
operations*  
.  

The  
I/C  >ARG1
design*  >ARG1
is*  
for  
a  
UltraSonic  
meter  <ARG2
and  
this  >>ARG0
is*  
dependent*  
on  
their  
testing  
schedule  <ARG1
(  
Canada  >ARG1
or  
Kansas  
are*  
the  
only  
two  
places  >ARG0
to  
test*  
to  
100  
%  <ARGM-EXT
of  
design*  
)  
.  

Will  >ARGM-MOD
confirm*  
testing  
schedule  <ARG1
and  
delivery  
dates  
with  
UltraSonic  <ARG2
ASAP  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
try*  
to  
complete*  
the  
I/C  <ARG1
with  
the  
earliest  
in  
-  
service*  
date  <<ARGM-ADV
possible  
,  
but  
with  
conditions  
as  
they  >ARG1
are*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
a  
realistic  
date  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
June  <ARG2
15  
,  
2002  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG1
have*  >>ARGM-ADV
questions*  
or  
issues*  
,  
please  >ARGM-DIS
let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
.

We  >>ARG0
are*  
looking*  
at  
putting*  
the  
metering  
facilities  <ARG1
on  
their  
ROW  <ARG2
(  
also  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
think*  
we  >>ARG1
will  
have*  
to  
purchase*  
about  
50  
ft  <ARG1
of  
ROW  
from  
ElPaso  <ARG2
to  
get*

As  
you  >ARG0
look*  
at  
this  <ARG1

if  
for  
some  
reason  >ARGM-CAU
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG

ElPaso  
ROW  <ARG1
,  
we  >>ARG0
will  
have*  
to  
look*  
at  
Plan*  
B  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
to  
put*  
the  
metering*  
on

ROW  <<ARG2
.  

Our  
in

service*  
date  >ARG1
is*  
May  <ARG2

.  

If  
you  >ARG0
think*  >>ARGM-ADV
that  
May  >>ARG1
1  
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
difficult*  
due  
to  
receiving*  
the  
parts  <ARG1

materials  
on  
a  
timely  
basis  <ARGM-TMP
because  
of  
the  
issues*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
vendors  >ARG0
may  
have*  
with  
us  <ARGM-COM
because  
of  
recent  
Enron  
events  <ARGM-CAU
,  
please  >ARGM-DIS
let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
.  

Questar  >>ARG0
has*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
informed*  
us  <ARG1
that  
they  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
help*  
obtain*  
parts  <ARG1

A

today  <ARGM-TMP
to  
start*  
serving*  
16  
subpoenas  <ARG1

electricity  
producers  >ARG0
and  
officials  
who  >R-ARG0

California

whether  
they  >>ARG0

in  
concert  <ARGM-LOC
to  
manipulate*  
energy  >ARG1

focusing*  
on  
a  
series  <ARG2
of  
events  >ARG1

fall  
filled*  
with  
enough  
Shakespearean  
plot  >ARG1
twists*  
and  
intrigue  
that

earned*

name  <ARG1

-

by  
the  
man  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
heads*  
the  
state  
's  
energy

-  
fueled*  
the  
California  
energy  
crisis  <ARG1

pushed*  
the  
state  <ARG1
into  
the  
power  
-  
buying  
business  <ARG2
and  
helped*  
make*  
billions  <ARG1
of  
dollars  
for  
power  
producers  <ARGM-GOL
.  

The  
central  >ARGM-ADJ
question*  >ARG1
behind  
the  
palace  
coup  <ARGM-ADJ
is*  
whether  
Terry  >ARG0
Winter  
,  
the  
president  
of  
the  
Independent  
System  
Operator  
,  
acted*  
alone  <ARGM-MNR

took*  >ARGM-LVB
steps*  >ARG0
to  
remove*  
key  >ARGM-ADJ

designed*  
to  
limit*  
the  
amount  >ARG1
power  
generators  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
charge*  
.  

Winter  >ARG0
defied*  
his  
own  
board  <ARG1
and  
Gov.  
Gray  
Davis  
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
filed*  
a  
50  
-  
page  >ARGM-ADJ
request*  
to  
remove*  
the  
caps*

"  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  >>ARG1
how  >>ARGM-MNR

taken*  
place  <ARG2

"  
said*  
Dunn  <ARG0
.  

The  
subpoenas  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
force*  
those  >>ARG0
involved*  
,  
including  
Winter  
,  
to  
provide*  
sworn  >ARGM-PRD

about  
the

and  
to

Davis  
spokesman  
Steve  >ARG0

the

"  
betrayed  <ARG1
"  
by  
the  
actions*  
of

"  
The

Maviglio  >ARG0

The

one  
goal  <<ARGM-PRP

At

refusing*  
to

"

''  

What  >>ARG1
became*  >>ARG1
known*  
as  
the

began*  
on

clear  >ARGM-ADJ
coordination*  
among

He  >ARG0
said*  
the  
main  >ARGM-ADJ

to

the  
Oct.

the

Can  >ARGM-MOD

this  <ARG1
today  <ARGM-TMP

soon

My  
take  >ARG1

that  
the

indifferent*  
to  
this  <ARG2

our

no  >ARGM-NEG

It  >ARG1
's*  
a  
two  
way*  
street  <<ARG2
,  
of  <<ARGM-ADV
course  
.  

Have*  
they  >ARG0
expressed*  
any  
interest*  
in  
negotiating*  
?  

There  
is*  
nothing  <ARG1
wrong  
with  
a  
REAL  >ARGM-ADJ
negotiation*  
,  
but  
nothing  >ARG0
particularly  >ARGM-ADV
helpful*  
about  
generating*  
one  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
s*  
just  
for  
show*  
.  

Particularly  
in  
the  
absence*  
of  
any  
entreaty  <ARG1
from  
them  
.  

Where  >ARG2
is*  
the  
"  
simple  >ARGM-MNR
"  
explanation*  
of  
the  
transportation  
piece  <ARG1
?  

As  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
told*  >ARGM-ADV
RNR  <ARG2
,  
I  >ARG0
think*  
we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
advise*  
Duke  <ARG1
in  
writing*  
that  
its  
IP  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
in  
conformity  <ARG2
with  
the  
contract  
,  <<ARG2
since  
it  >ARG1
is*  
in  
the  
alternative  <ARG2
,  
and  
that  
our  
IP  >ARG1
is*  
hence  <ARGM-ADV
the  
only  
one  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
before  
the  
arbitrators  <ARG2
(  
since  
Duke  >>ARG0
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
change*  
it's  
ineffective  
IP  <ARG1
at  
this  
stage  <ARGM-TMP
,  
having*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
seen*  
ours  <ARG1
)  
.  

Accordingly  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
issue*  >>ARG1
left*  
for  
arbitration*  
is*  
whether  
our  
IP  >>ARG1
(  
the  
only  
one  
and  
therefore  
the  
one  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
choose*  
)  
is*  
or  
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
an  
economic  
hardship  <ARG2
under  
the  
contract  
.  

What  >ARG1

Dear  
Mr.  
Sanders  
-  

?  

While  
I  >ARG0
left*  >ARGM-ADV
a  
you  <ARG2
a  
phone  
message  <ARG1
with  
some  
information  
about  
our  
project  
,  
I  >ARG0
thought*  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
give*  
you  <ARG2
some  
additional  
details  <ARG1
by  
e-mail  <ARGM-MNR
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
...  

?  

We  >>ARG1
are*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
very  >ARGM-EXT
interested*  
in  
having*  
Enron  >ARG0
support*  
our  
eCommerce  
Dispute  >ARG1
Management*  
Protocol  <<ARG1
.?  

We  
have*  
had*  >ARGM-LVB
enthusiastic  >ARGM-MNR
responses*  
from  
companies  
such  
as  
AT&T  
,  
Duke  
Energy  
,  
Pitney  
Bowes  
and  
Daimler  
Chrysler  
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
pleased*  
to  
answer*  
any  
questions*  >ARGM-PRR
you  <ARG0
may  <ARGM-MOD
have*  
about  
this  
focal  
point  <<ARG1
for  
our  >ARG0
educational  >ARG1
efforts*  
.?  

The  
real  
purpose  >>ARG1
of  
my  >ARG0
call*  
,  
however  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
is*  
related*  
to  
the  
services*  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
provide*  
to  
support*  
the  
aspirational  >ARGM-ADJ
statements*  
of  
the  
Protocol  <ARG0
.  

I  >ARG1
am*  
a  
member  <ARG2
of  
the  
design  
group  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
has*  
been*  
developing*  
the  
American  
Arbitration  
Association  >>ARG0
's  
dispute  >ARG1
management*  >ARG1
systems  <<ARG1
and  
services*  
for  
eCommerce  
B2B  >ARG1
transactions*  
.?  

At  
this  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG0
are*  
putting*  
together  <ARG2
small  
working  
groups  >>ARG0
to  
validate*  
some  <ARG1
of  
our  >ARG0
assumptions*  
and  
refine*  
our  >ARG0
initial  >ARGM-TMP
service  >ARG1
offerings*  
.  

Initially  >ARGM-ADV
our  
design  
group  >>ARG0
,  
along  
with  
perhaps  
one  
of  
our  
technology  
consultants  
,  
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
meet*  
with  
a  
group  <ARG1
of  
Enron  
people  
for  
half  
a  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.?  

Ideally  >ARGM-ADV
this  
group  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
consist*  
of  
four  
to  
six  
people  <ARG2
from  
finance*  
,  
legal  
,  
and  
operations*  
so  
that  
we  >ARG0
get*  
good  
cross-functional  
feedback  <ARG1
about  
our  >ARG0
services*  
.?  

Before  
the  
meeting*  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
provide*  
you  <ARG2
with  
a  
brief  >ARGM-ADJ
description*  
of  
our  >ARG0
proposed  >ARGM-PRD
service  >ARG1
offerings*  
and  
a  
list  
of  
points  
for  
discussion*  
at  
the  
meeting*  
.  

The  
real  
focus  >>ARG1
of  
the  
meeting*  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
on  
how  >ARGM-MNR
we  >>ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
build*  
these  
services*  
to  
meet*  
the  
needs*  
of  
businesses  >ARG0
operating*  
in  
B2B  
marketplaces  <ARGM-LOC
.?  

We  >>ARG1
are*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
concerned*  
with  
providing*  
services*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are*  
relevant*  
to  
that  
environment  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
meet*  
between  
November  <ARGM-TMP
14  
and  
?  
December  
1  
?  
since  
construction*  >>ARG1
of  
our  >ARG0
services*  
is*  
already  <ARGM-TMP
underway  <ARG2
.?  

Please  >>ARGM-DIS
let*  
me  >>ARG0
know*  
what  >>ARG1
is*  
possible*  
,  
and  
feel*  
free*  
to  
give*  >ARGM-LVB
me  >ARG1
a  
call*  
if  
you  >>ARG0
have*  >ARGM-LVB
any  
questions*

reading*  
this  <ARG1
I  >ARG0
blame*  
the  
kids  <ARG1
.....  

Not  
so  
,  
Kids  >>ARG0
are*  
what  >ARG2
kids  >ARG1
are*  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
do*  
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
literally  <ARGM-ADV
monkey  >ARG0
see*  
and  
monkey  >ARG0
do*  
with  
them  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

That  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
likely  >ARGM-ADV
never  >ARGM-NEG
change*  
.  

It  
's*  
the  
bad  
parents  >>ARG0
out  
there  
who  >>R-ARG0
fuck*  
up  
their  
lives  <ARG1
and  
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
seem*  
to  
understand*  
that  
once  
you  >>ARG0
decide*  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
have*  
kids  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG1
is*  
indeed  <ARGM-ADV
time  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
grow*  
up  
and  
be*  
a  
responsible  
role  
model  <ARG2
for  
those  
kids  
.  

Very  
few  
parents  >ARG0
do*  
this  <ARG1
.  

And  
this  >ARG1
is*  
a  
direct  
result  <ARG2
of  
the  
Politically  
correct  
,  
permissive  
,  
time  
out  
granting  
bullshit  
liberal  
culture  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
has*  
caused*  
this  <ARG1
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
blame*  >ARGM-TMP
it  <ARG2
all  
on  
society  <ARG1
,  
there  
's*  
noone  >ARG0
to  
to  
take*  
responsibility  <ARG1
and  
all  
of  
a  
sudden  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
have*  
generation  <ARG1
of  
fucked  
up  
kids  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
are*  
likley  >>ARGM-ADV
smoking*  
,  
drinking*  
,  
doing*  
drugs  <ARG1
,  
fucking*  
the  
neighbor  <ARG1
or  
some  
internet  
perv  
just  
because  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
too  >ARGM-CXN
lazy*  
to  
see*  
waht  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
're*  
doing*  
.  

People  >ARG0
like  
this  
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
my  
sympathy  <ARG1
,  
nor  
do*  
they  >ARG0
deserve*  
my  
sympathy  <ARG1
.  

Look*  
inside  
yourselves  <ARG1
parents  <ARGM-DIS
,  
is*  
this  <ARG1
you  <ARG2
?  

Probably  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
is*  
.  

Fuck*  
you  <ARG1

Stop*

"

You  >>ARG1

a

a

you  >>ARG0

that  >ARG1

Tough

Just  
because

It  >ARG0
looks*  
like  
NASA  >>ARG1
is*  
ready*  
to  
sour*  
again  <ARGM-TMP
after  
it's  >ARG0
devastating  >ARGM-ADJ
loss*  
from  
the  
Columbia  
accident  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
occurred*  
nearly  
two  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
NASA  
engineers  >>ARG1
and  
astronauts  
are*  
almost  >ARGM-EXT
giddy*  
with  
"  
go  
"  
fever  <ARGM-MNR
as  
the  
tentative  
date  >>ARG1
for  
the  
first  >ARGM-TMP
launch*  
since  
the  
Columbia  
disaster  <ARGM-TMP
approaches*  
.  

The  
most  
important  >ARGM-ADJ
question*  >ARG1
is*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
whether  
Discovery  >>ARG1
is*  
technically  >ARGM-MNR
ready*  
to  
fly*  
with  
new  
safety  
features  <ARGM-MNR
and  
emergency  >ARGM-PRP
procedures*  
,  
but  
whether  
the  
agency  >>ARG0
itself  
has*  
learned*  
from  
the  
crucial  >ARGM-ADJ
errors*  
most  
common  <ARGM-ADJ
to  
Challenger  
and  
Columbia  
,  
errors*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
grew*  
out  
of  
a  
management  
culture  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
discouraged*  
criticism  <ARG1
and  
sacrificed*  
safety  <ARG1
for  
image  
-  
puffing*  
and  
budget  >ARG1
-  
cutting*  
.  

I  >ARG0
hope*  
so  <ARG1
.  

Seeing*  >ARG1
another  
"  
Columbia  
"  
incident  <ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
quite  
frightening  <ARG2
(  
I  >ARG1
woke*  
up  
to  
it  <ARG3
early  
in  
the  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
was*  
in  
Texas  <ARG2
)  
.  

We  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
need*  
another  
incident  <ARG1
as  
exploring*  >ARG1
the  
cosmos  <ARG1
is*  
something  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
keeps*  
our  >ARG0
imagination*  >ARG1
going*  
as  
a  
species  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Maybe  >ARGM-ADV
one  
day  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
allow*  
space  
tourism  <ARG1
,  
(  
hopefully  >ARGM-MNR
that  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
in  
the  
near  
future  <ARG2
)  
although  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
that  
NASA  >ARG0
build*  
new  
shuttles  <ARG1
instead  
of  
trying*  
to  
preserve*  
the  
older  
ones  <ARG1
.  

You  >>ARG0
do*  
have*  
to  
give*  
NASA  <ARG2
credit*  
on  
some  
things  <<ARGM-ADV
as  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
eliminated*  
the  
"  
fear*  
of  
reporting*  
failure  <ARG1
"  
culture  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
probably  >ARGM-ADV
led*  
to  
the  
lack*  
of  
reporting*  
defects  <ARG1
on  
the  
Columbia  
shuttle  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Instead  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG0
are*  
encouraging*  
everyone  >ARG1
to  
come*  
forward  <ARGM-DIR
if  
they  >ARG0
see*  
any  
potential  
problems  <ARG1
(  
as  
it  
is*  
clear*  
that  
overlooked*  
problems  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
result*  
in  
unnecessary  >ARGM-ADJ
losses*  
)  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
supporters  >>ARG0
are*  
pointing*  
a  
few  
good  
things  <ARG1
out  <C-V
:  

Clearly  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
agency  >>ARG0
has*  
worked*  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
at  
tackling*  
the  
technical  >ARGM-ADJ
challenges*  >ARG1
posed*  
by  
a  
superb  
and  
surprisingly  
independent  
-  
minded  
investigative  
panel  <ARG0
.  

A  
few  
weeks  
ago  >ARGM-TMP
,  
shuttle  
workers  >ARG0
at  
the  
Kennedy  
Space  
Center  
received*  
a  
rocket  
-  
like  >ARGM-MNR
boost*  
in  
morale  <ARG1
with  
two  
important  >ARGM-ADJ
deliveries*  >ARG1
for  
the  
next  
shuttle  >ARG0
to  
carry*  
.  

One  >ARG1
is*  
a  
special  
tool  >ARG0
to  
detect*  
damage*  
to  
the  
thermal  
-  
protective  
tile  <ARG1
while  
in  
orbit  <<ARGM-TMP
-  
something  >>ARG1
the  
Columbia  
crew  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
welcomed*  
.  

The  
other  >ARG1
is*  
a  
new  
fuel  
tank  >ARG1
"  
guaranteed*  
"  
by  
NASA  <ARG0
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
shed*  
potentially  
fatal  
hunks  <ARG1
of  
insulation*  
.  

NASA  >>ARG0
has*  
some  
PR  
hurdles  >ARG1
to  
overcome*  
in  
the  
future  <ARGM-TMP
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
let*  
s  >ARG0
hope*  
for  
their  
sake  <ARGM-PRP
(  
and  
the  
sake  
of  
all  
space  
lovers  
out  
there  
)  
that  
they  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
redefine*  
their  
image  <ARG1
and  
rekindle*  
the  
hope*  
of  
space  >ARG1
colonization*  
again  <<ARGM-TMP

Healing*  
the  
Collective  
Body  <ARG1

In  
George  
Orwell  
's  
influential  
novel  >ARGM-LOC
"  
1984  
"  
doublethink  >>ARG0
is*  
a  
device  >ARG1
promoted*  
by  
the  
totalitarian  
state  
government  <ARG0
to  
make*  
people  >ARG0
accept*  
two  
irreconcilable  
ideas  <ARG1
at  
the  
same  
time  <ARGM-TMP
such  
as  
"  
war*  >ARG1
is*  
peace*  
"  
.  

I  >ARG0
see*  
the  
merit  <ARG1
in  
flowing*  
with  
duality  <ARGM-MNR
.  

One  >>ARG1
of  
my  
most  >ARGM-ADV
cherished*  
dualities  <ARG1
is*  
the  
understanding*  
that  
we  >ARG1
are*  
both  <ARGM-ADV
autonomous  
individuals  <ARG2
with  
the  
power  >ARGM-MNR
to  
shape*  
our  
personal  
destinies  <ARG1
and  
at  
the  
same  
time  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG1
are*  
all  <ARGM-ADV
one  <ARG2
,  
that  
there  
is*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
separation*  
between  
you  <ARG1
and  
I  
,  
we  >ARG1
are*  
all  <ARGM-ADV
together  <ARG2
in  
this  
thing  >ARG1
called*  
life  <ARG2
,  
we  >ARGM-ADJ
human  >ARG1
beings*  
,  
the  
birds  
and  
the  
tress  
,  
the  
rocks  
and  
the  
sky  
,  
all  
of  
it  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
written*  
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT
recently  <ARGM-TMP
about  
healing*  
the  
self  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-ADV
today  >ARGM-TMP
here  >ARG2
are*  
a  
few  
words  <ARG1
on  
healing*  
our  
collective  
body  <ARG1
,  
mind  
and  
soul  
.  

Think*  
of  
all  
life  <ARG1
,  
if  
you  
will  <ARGM-ADV
,  
as  
one  
great  
choir  <ARG2
or  
one  
grand  >ARGM-ADJ
congregation*  
.  

Our  
strength  >ARG1
is*  
in  
our  
unity  <ARG2
and  
harmony  
.  

Any  
major  
dischord  
and  
we  >ARG0
all  
suffer*  
.  

Any  
insult*  >ARG0
to  
the  
collective  
good  <ARG1
brings*  
us  <ARG1
all  
down  <ARG3
.  

Living*  >ARG1
out  
of  
synch  <ARGM-MNR
with  
nature  
is*  
the  
great  
disease  <ARG2
,  
from  
that  >ARGM-DIR
flows*  
all  
the  
tributaries  >>ARG1
we  >>ARG0
have*  
come*  
to  
think*  
of  <C-ARG1
as  
sickness  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG1
are*  
only  >ARGM-ADV
as  >ARGM-CXN
strong*  
as  
our  
weakest  <C-ARGM-CXN
,  
we  >>ARG2
are*  
only  >ARGM-ADV
as  >ARGM-CXN
healthy*  
as  
the  
sickest  <C-ARGM-CXN
amongst  
us  
-  
playing*  >>ARG0
sports  <ARG1
and  
being*  
in  
the  
army  <ARG2
taught*  
me  <ARG2
that  
lesson*  
before  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
finished*  
being*  
a  
teenager  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
the  
healthy  >ARG0
treat*  >ARGM-TMP
the  
sick  <ARG1
with  
scorn  <ARG2
and  
intolerance  
it  >ARG0
brings*  
us  <ARG1
all  
down  <ARG3
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
those  >>ARG0
lucky  
enough  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
have*  
Herpes  <ARG1
create*  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
climate  <ARG1
of  
shame*  
and  
indignity  
for  
those  <<ARG3
of  
us  
who  
do*  
,  
not  
only  
are*  
they  >ARG0
hurting*  
us  <ARG1
,  
but  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
hurting*  
themselves  <ARG1
.  

There  
is*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
escape*  
from  
the  
collective  
ocean  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
all  
swim*  
in  <C-ARG1
.  

What  >>ARG0
you  >ARG0
project*  
will  >ARGM-MOD
always  >ARGM-TMP
come*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
to  
either  
reward*  
or  
haunt*  
you  <ARG1
.  

We  >>ARG0
are*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
suffering*  
from  
the  
consequences  <ARG1
of  
our  
rape  
of  
the  
environment  
,  
our  
rejection  
of  
the  
natural  
for  
the  
industrial  
,  
and  
our  >ARG0
embrace*  
of  
violence  <ARG1
over  
peace*  
.  

Jesus  >ARG0
said*  
that  
what  >>ARG1
you  >ARG0
do*  
the  
least  <ARG2
of  
the  
people  
you  >ARG0
do*  
to  
him  <ARG2
.  

What  >>ARG1
are*  
you  >ARG0
doing*  
to  
the  
least  <ARG2
of  
the  
people  
?  

If  
we  >ARG1
are*  
all  <ARGM-ADV
in  
this  
thing  >ARGM-ADV
together  <ARGM-MNR
,  
let*  
's  >ARG0
play*  
nice  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Remember*  
that  
what  >>ARG0
you  >ARG0
do*  
to  
yourself  <ARG2
affects*  
me  <ARG1
and  
everybody  
else  
,  
remember*  
that  
what  >>ARG0
you  >ARG0
do*  
to  
me  <ARG2
and  
anyone  
else  
shapes*  
your  
destiny  <ARG1
.  

No  
matter  >>ARGM-ADV
what  
progress*  >ARG1
we  >>ARG2
make*  
as  
individuals  <ARGM-ADV
in  
becoming*  
healthier*  
,  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
achieve*  
real  
health  <ARG1
until  
we  >>ARG0
collectively  >ARGM-MNR
decide*  
to  
create*  
a  
healthier  
reality  <ARG1
.  

Fortunately  >ARGM-DIS
circumstances  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
force*  
our  
hand  <ARG1
soon  <ARGM-TMP
since  
our  
collective  
bad  
behaviour  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
continue*  
indefinitely  <ARGM-TMP
.  

In  
the  
near  
future  >>ARGM-TMP
collective  >ARGM-ADJ
choices*  >>ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
to  
be*  
made*  
.  

Will  >ARGM-MOD
we  >>ARG1
choose*  
to  
live*  
in  
harmony  <ARG1
with  
this  
planet  <ARGM-COM
or  
crash*  
and  
burn*  
in  
a  
conflagration*  
of  
arrogance  <ARG2
and  
disregard  
?  

Will  >ARGM-MOD
we  >>ARG0
choose*  
to  
rise*  
about  
prejudice  <ARGM-CAU
and  
intolerance  
or  
go*  
down  <ARGM-DIR
kicking*  
and  
screaming*  
with  
holding*  
on  
to  
fear*  
and  
anger  
?  

There  
is*  
no  
health  <ARG1
without  
peace*  
and  
no  >ARGM-NEG
peace*  
without  
health  <ARGM-ADJ

the  
kaoshikii  >ARG1
dance*  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is*

tremendous  >ARGM-ADJ
positive  >ARGM-ADJ
effects*  
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
a  
dance*  
for  
both  
males  <ARG0
and  
females  
.  

Dharma  

--  

Kaoshikii  >ARG1
is*  
a  
dance*  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
was*  
invented*  
in  
1978  <ARGM-TMP
by  
Shrii  <ARG0
Shrii  
A'nandamu'rti  
.  

It  >>ARG0
is*  
a  
psycho-spiritual  >ARG1
exercise*  
and  
benefiting*  
the  
mind  <ARG1
by  
developing*  
stamina  <ARG1
and  
strength  
.  

Kaoshikii  >>ARG1
is*  
especially  >ARGM-EXT
good*  
for  
women  <ARG2
.  

It  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
ward*  
off  
and  
cure*  
a  
number  <ARG2
of  
diseases  
,  
keeps*  
the  
body  <ARG1
youthful  <ARG2
and  
enables*  
an  
easy  >ARGM-ADJ
delivery*  
in  
childbirth  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Kaoshikii  >ARG1
comes*  
from  
the  
Sanskrit  
word  >ARG1
'  
kosa  
'  
meaning*  
shell  <ARG2
or  
layer  
of  
mind  
.  

The  
self  >>ARG1
of  
the  
individual  
lies*  
hidden*  
in  
the  
innermost  
layers  <ARGM-LOC
of  
existence  
(  
kosas  
)  
.  

Thus  >ARGM-DIS
kaoshikii  >ARG1
is*  
a  
blossoming*  
of  
the  
microcosm  >>ARG0
(  
unit  >ARG1
being*  
)  
in  
its  >ARG0
attempt*  
to  
attain*  
a  
link  <ARG1
with  
the  
Macrocosm  
(  
Cosmic  
Consciousness  
)  
.  

This  
attempt*  >>ARG1
is*  
normally  >ARGM-TMP
referred*  
to  <C-ARG1
as  
mysticism  <ARG2
.

Hi  
all  
,  

There  
are*  
already  <ARGM-TMP
several  
forums  >ARG1
around  
the  
net  
focused*  
on  
discussing*  
Guild  
Wars  <ARG1
,  
so  
why  >ARGM-CAU
create*  
a  
new  
one  <ARG1
?  

I  >ARG0
say*  
why  
not  <ARG1
?  

The  
main  
reason  >ARG1
is*  
Google  >>ARG1
is*  
more  >ARGM-EXT
accessible*  
to  
the  
global  
community  <ARG0
and  
you  >>ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
rest*  
assured*  
that  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
not  
going*  
to  
go*  
away  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
seen*  
great  
fan  
sites  >ARG1
suddenly  >ARGM-TMP
disappear*  
without  
notice*  
and  
for  
no  
reason  
.  

Usually  >ARGM-ADV
this  >ARG1
happens*  
because  
the  
developer  >ARG0
of  
the  
site  
can  >ARGM-MOD
no  
longer  >ARGM-NEG
afford*  
the  
cost  <ARG1
of  
bandwidth  >>ARG1
being*  
used*  
.  

That  >ARG1
said*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
maintenance*  >>ARG1
of  
this  
forum  <ARG1
is*  
handled*  
by  
Google  <ARG0
and  
thus  >>ARGM-ADV
will  >>ARGM-MOD
remain*  
reliable*  
and  
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
ultimately  >ARGM-ADV
give*  
us  >ARG0
more  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
play*  
:)  
.  

I  >ARG1
'm*  
nothing  <ARG2
more  
than  
a  
devoted  
fan  
of  
the  
game  
myself  <ARGM-REC
and  
I  >ARG0
hope*  
that  
this  
area  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
become*  
a  
haven  <ARG2
for  
deep  >ARGM-ADJ
fan  >ARG0
discussions*

although  
Guild  
Wars  >>ARG1
is*  
made*  
by  
ex-members  <ARG0
of  
Blizzard  
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
Feb  >ARG1
2005  
could  >ARGM-MOD
mean*  
August  <ARG2
2006  
...  

Anyway  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
tried*  
to  
get*  
a  
preorder  <ARG1
but  
no  
places  >>ARG0
were*  
selling*  
it  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
missed*  
out  
on  
2/3  
weekend  
events  <ARG1
.  

Oh  >ARGM-DIS
well  
,  
I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
it  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
comes*  
out  
in  
Febuary  <ARGM-TMP
.  

rumor*  >ARG0
has*  
feb  <ARG1
05  
on  
the  
calender  <ARGM-LOC
.  

BUT  
they  >>ARG0
stated*  
that  
they  >ARG2
will  
take*  
as  
long  <ARG1
as  
it  >ARG1
takes*  
to  
work*  
out  
all  
the  
bugs  <ARG1
so  
who  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
know*  
how  
long  <ARG1
.  

as  
far  >>ARGM-ADV
as  
pre  
order*  
go*  
to  <ARG4
and  
they  >ARG0
have*  
a  
list  <ARG1
of  
major  
retailers  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
carry*  
it  <ARG1
there  
are*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
a  
few  
websites  <ARG1
that  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
order*  
it  <ARG1
off  
of  <ARG3
.  

and  
a  
good  
reason  
for  
starting*  
this  
group  <ARG1
....  
company  
firewalls  
lol  
;)  

I  >>ARG1
was*  
kind  >ARGM-EXT
of  
curious*  
,  
what  >ARG2
exactly  
is*  
Guild  
Wars  <ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG0
hav*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
heard*  
of  
it  <ARG1
.  

Check*  
out  
the  
Guild  
Wars  
Web  
site  <ARG1
at  
for  
more  
info  <ARG2
about  
the  
game  
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
a  
massive  
multiplayer  
role  >ARG1
playing*  
game  <<ARG2
.  

The  
graphics  >ARG1
are*  
without  
a  
doubt*  
the  
amoung  
the  
best  
graphics  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
seen*  
for  
any  
game  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
gaming*  
since  
the  
MUD  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
worth*  
a  
look*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
a  
preorder  <ARG1
and  
am*  
even  >ARGM-ADV
considering*  
getting*  
a  
second  
preorder  <ARG1
to  
have*  
multiple  
accounts  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
participated*  
in  
all  
the  
weekend  
beta  
events  <ARG1
and  
the  
world  
preview  
.  

The  
game  >>ARG0
is*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
100  
%  >ARGM-EXT
functional*  
.  

I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
imagine*  
them  >>ARG0
not  >>ARGM-NEG
being*  
able*  
to  
meet*  
the  
Feb

deadline  <ARG1
.  

Warm  >ARGM-ADJ
greetings*  
to  
all  <ARG1
in  
this  
GW  
community  
.  

I  >ARG1
am*  
Lady  <ARG2
Kingel  
and  
I  >ARG0
hail*  
from  
the  
United  
Legit  
Gaming  
Guilds  <ARG1
of  
Guild  
Wars  
.  

We  >ARG1
are*  
a  
consortium  >>ARG1
of  
legit  
honorable  
guilds  
that  >>R-ARG1
was*  
established*  
in  
1997  <ARGM-TMP
for  
DI  <ARG3
and  
we  >>ARG0
are*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
adding*  
GW  <ARG1
to  
the  
list  <ARG2
of  
games  >ARG1
played*  
.  

The  
alliance  >ARG1
is*  
a  
pretty  
straightforward  
one  <ARG2
.  

It  >>ARG0
was*  
formed*  
to  
allow*  
many  
different  
guilds  >>ARG0
who  >R-ARG1
were*  
all  <ARGM-ADV
strictly  
honorable  <ARG2
to  
come*  
together  <ARGM-ADV
as  
a  
family  <ARG2
and  
allow*  
them  <ARG1
many  
people  >ARGM-COM
to  
game*  
with  <C-ARGM-COM
.  

There  
are*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
other  >ARGM-EXT
requirements*  
other  <ARGM-ADJ
than  
we  >ARG0
ask*  
that  
members  >>ARG0
greet*  
each  
new  
member  <ARG1
and  
each  
new  
alliance  
and  
also  
feel*  
free*  
to  
post*  
in  
any  <ARG2

the

.  

We  >ARG1
are*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
a  
group  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
is*  
looking*  
for  
members  <ARG1
for  
our  
own  
select  
guild  >>ARG1
called*  
ULGG  <ARG2
of  
GW  
...  
which  >R-ARG1
is*  
a  
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
alliance  
with  
the  
same  
name  
.  

We  >ARG0
play*  
in  
all  
aspects  <ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
game  
and  
we  >ARG0
hand  >ARGM-MNR
pick*  
our  
members  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD

to  
personally  >ARGM-MNR
invite*  
each  >ARG0
of  
you  
to

You  >ARG1

in  
our  
alliance  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
seek*  
quality  <ARG1
of

over  
quantity  
of  
member

You  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
asked*  
to  
register*  
,  
and  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0

the  
Announce*  
Your  >ARG1

many

this  
wonderful

I  >>ARG0
do*  
hope*  
to  
see*  
you  >ARG0
visiting*  
us  <ARG1
at  
the  
fire  <ARGM-LOC
and  
we  >ARG0
shall  >ARGM-MOD

a

Policemen

we  >ARG1

Who  >ARG2
are*  
we  <ARG1
?  

We  >ARG1
are*  
the  
downtrodden  <ARG2
and  
dispossesed  
,  
the  
self  
-  
torturing  
,  
the  
disenfranchised*  
convicts  <ARG1
,  
drug  
and  
alcohol  
addicts  
,  
the  
unemployed  
and  
unemployable  
.  

We  >ARG1
are*  
the  
children  <ARG2
of  
poverty  
,  
financial  
and  
spiritual  
.  

We  >>ARG0
have*  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
children  <ARG1
of  
our

We  >>ARG0
are*  
ex-cons  <ARG2

uninsured  
,  
homeless  
,  
of  
many  
colors  
and  
speaking*  
many

We  >ARG1
are*  
the  
enemy  <ARG2
in  
what  >>ARG1
has*  
become*  
a  
domestic  >ARGM-ADJ
war*  
against  
ourselves  <ARG1
.  

And  
who  >ARG2
are*  
you  <ARG1
?  

You  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
like*  
the  
tough  >ARGM-MNR
talk*  
of  
Tough  <ARG0
on  
Crime  
?  

You  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
watch*  
as  
budgets  >>ARG1
are*  
cut*  
in  
education*  
and  
health  >ARGM-ADJ
care*  
while  
you  >ARG0
militarize*  
a  
police  
force  <ARG2
?  

Bullet  
-  
proof  
vests  
,  
automatic  
weapons  
,  
helicopters

,  
robots

,

And  
what  >ARG1
is*  
there  
to  
show*  
for  
it  <ARGM-PRP
?  

Unemployent  >>ARG1
stays*  
low*  
because  
half  
the

those  <ARG1
"  
out

"  
,  
the  
dregs  
,  
the  
rabble  
,  
the  
enemy  
?  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
tell*  
me  <ARG2
there  
is*  
a  
deeper  
reason  <ARG1
.  

Do*  
you  >>ARG1
feel*  
safer*  
?  

More  
humane  
?  

More  
like  
a  
cohesive  
society  >>ARG0
with  
a  
shared  >ARGM-PRD
sense*  
of  
purpose  <ARG1
,  
who  >R-ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
identify*  
Us  <ARG1
and  
Them  
?  

Do*  
you  >ARG0
live*  
in  
a  
gated  
community  <ARGM-LOC
or  
gentrified  
neighborhood  
?  

By  
the  
way  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
have*  
you  >ARG0
read*  
the  
Declaration  <ARG1
of  
Independence  
and  
US  
Constitution  
-  
or  
do*  
you  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
know*  
the  
first  
phrases  <ARG1
?  

It  >ARG1
's*  
about  
time  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
got*  
together  
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
know*  
that  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
yet  <ARG1
to  
meet*  
a  
convict  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
wants*  
their  
child  >ARG1
to  
be*  
a  
thief  <ARG2
,  
an  
addict  
,  
a  
dealer  
,  
a  
prostitute  
,  
or  
a  
violent  
individual  
.  

Most  >ARG0
of  
us  
still  >ARGM-TMP
have*  
hope*  
for  
ourselves  <ARG1
even  
when  >ARGM-TMP
stuck*  
in  
the  
darkest  
dilemmas  <ARG2
,  
ruts  
and  
catch  
-  
22s  
.  

Most  >ARG0
of  
us  
believe*  
in  
crafting*  
laws  <ARG1
and  
instilling*  
order*  
.  

Many  >>ARG0
of  
us  
have*  
burrowed*  
beneath  
the  
surface  <ARG1
to  
find*  
a  
spiritual  >ARGM-ADJ
sense*  
of  
being*  
,  
an  
understanding  
force  
at  
least  
as  
powerful  
as  
those  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
succumbed*  
to  <C-ARG1
,  
and  
many  >ARG0
of  
use  
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
escape*  
if  
you  >ARG0
opened*  
the  
front  
door  <ARG1
.  

Did*  
you  >ARG0
know*  
that  
approximately  
10  
million  
Americans  >>ARG1
are*  
either  
incarcerated*  
,  
on  
probation*  
,  
on  
parole*  
or  
once  >ARGM-TMP
were*  
in  
those  
categories  <ARG2
?  

Each  >ARG0
of  
those  
10  
million  
have*  
families  <ARG1
,  
friends  
,  
neighbors  
...  
and  
so  
closer  
and  
closer  
does*  
the  
We  
interface  
with  
the  
You  
.  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
you  >ARG0

it  >ARG1

time  >ARGM-TMP

?  

Are*  
you  >ARG1

that  
the

Do*  
you  >ARG0

the  
heart  >ARGM-ADV
to  
face*  
monumental  
failures  <ARG1
while  
bravely  >ARGM-MNR
struggling*  
beyond  
where  >ARG2
we  >ARG1
are*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
?  

I  >ARG0
know*  
that  
some  
of  
you  
are*  
,  
and  
that  
some  
of  
us  
are*  
,  
and  
this  >ARG1
is*  
what  >ARG0
gives*  
me  <ARG2
hope*  
.  

You  >ARG0
need*  
our  
insights  <ARG1
just  
as  
we  >ARG0
need*  
your  
structure  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1

never  <ARGM-NEG
over  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
especially  
when  >>R-ARGM-TMP
a

a

This

might  >ARGM-MOD
surprise*  
you  <ARG1
because  
we  >>ARG0

not  >ARGM-NEG

I  >>ARG0

of  
money  
to  
an

requiring*  
maximum

I  >>ARG0

you  <ARG2
in  
absolute  
confidence  <ARGM-MNR
primarily  >ARGM-ADV

that  >>R-ARG1

presently  >ARGM-TMP

in  
the

.  

My

and  
I  
solicit*  
your  >ARG0
assistance*  
in  
completing*  
a  
transaction*  >ARG1
begun*  
by  
my  
father  >>ARG0
,  
who  >>R-ARG0
has*  
long  >>ARGM-TMP
been*  
actively  >ARGM-MNR
engaged*  
in  
the  
extraction*  
of  
petroleum  <ARG1
in  
the  
United  
States  <ARG2
of  
America  
,  
and  
bravely  >ARGM-MNR
served*  
his  
country  <ARG2
as  
director  <ARG1
of  
the  
United  
States  
Central  
Intelligence  
Agency  
.  

In  
the  
decade  >ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
nineteen  
-  
eighties  
,  
my  
father  >>ARG0
,  
then  
vice  
-  
president  
of  
the  
United  
States  
of  
America  
,  
sought*  
to  
work*  
with  
the  
good  
offices  <ARG3
of  
the  
President  
of  
the  
Republic  
of  
Iraq  
to  
regain*  
lost  
oil  
revenue  
sources  <ARG1
in  
the  
neighboring*  
Islamic  
republic  <ARG1
of  
Iran  
.  

This  
unsuccessful  
venture  >>ARG2
was*  
soon  >ARGM-TMP
followed*  
by  
a  
falling*  
-  
out  <C-V
with  
his  
Iraqi  
partner  >>ARG0
,  
who  >>R-ARG0
sought*  
to  
acquire*  
additional  
oil  
revenue  
sources  <ARG1
in  
the  
neighboring*  
emirate  <ARG1
of  
Kuwait  
,  
a  
wholly  
-  
owned  
U.S.  
-  
British  
subsidiary  
.  

My  
father  >ARG0
re-secured*  
the  
petroleum  
assets  <ARG1
of  
Kuwait  
in  
1991  <ARGM-TMP
at  
a  
cost  <ARGM-ADV
of  
sixty  
-  
one  
billion  
U.S.  
dollars  
(  
$  
61,000,000,000  
)  
.  

Out  
of  
that  
cost  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
thirty  
-  
six  
billion  
dollars  >>ARG1
(  
$  
36,000,000,000  
)  
were*  
supplied*  
by  
King  
Hussein  <ARG0
,  
Kingdom  
of  
Saudi  
Arabia  
and  
other  
Persian  
Gulf  
monarchies  
,  
and  
sixteen  
billion  
dollars  
(  
$  
16,000,000,000  
)  
by  
German  
and  
Japanese  
partners  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
my  
father  
's  
former  
Iraqi  
business  
partner  >ARG1
remained*  
in  
control*  
of  
the  
republic  <ARG1
of  
Iraq  
and  
its  
petroleum  
reserves  
.  

My  
family  >>ARG0
is*  
calling*  
for  
your  >ARG0
urgent  >ARGM-ADJ
assistance*  
in  
funding*  
the  
removal*  
of  
the  
President  <ARG1
of  
the  
Republic  
of  
Iraq  
and  
acquiring*  
the  
petroleum  
assets  <ARG1
of  
his  
country  
,  
as  
compensation*  
for  
the  
costs  <ARG1
of  
removing*  
him  <ARG1
from  
power  <ARG2
.  

Unfortunately  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
our  
partners  >>ARG1
from  
1991  
are*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
willing*  
to  
shoulder*  
the  
burden*  
of  
this  
new  
venture  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
in  
its  
upcoming  
phase  >ARGM-TMP
may  >ARGM-MOD
cost*  
the  
sum  <ARG2
of  
100  
billion  
to  
200  
billion  
dollars  
(  
$  
100,000,000,000  
-  
$  
200,000,000,000  
)  
,  
both  
in  
the  
initial  >ARGM-TMP
acquisition*  
and  
in  
long  
-  
term  >ARGM-TMP
management*  
.  

Without  
the  
funds  >>ARGM-ADV
from  
our  
1991  
partners  
,  
we  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
able*  
to  
acquire*  
the  
oil  
revenue  >ARG1
trapped*  
within  
Iraq  <ARG2
.  

That  >ARG1
is*  
why  >>ARGM-CAU
my  
family  >>ARG0
and  
our  
colleagues  
are*  
urgently  >ARGM-MNR
seeking*  
your  >ARG0
gracious  >ARGM-ADJ
assistance*  
.  

Our  
distinguished  
colleagues  >>ARG2
in  
this  
business  >ARG1
transaction*  
include*  
the  
sitting  
vice-president  >ARG1

the  
United

of  
America  
,  
Richard  
Cheney  
,  
who  >R-ARG1
is*  
an  
original  
partner  <ARG2
in  
the  
Iraq  
venture  
and  
former  
head  
of  
the  
Halliburton  
oil  
company  
,  
and  
Condoleeza  >>ARG1

,  
whose  >C-ARG0
professional  >ARGM-ADJ
dedication*  >>R-ARG1
to  
the  
venture  <ARG2
was*  
demonstrated*  
in  
the  
naming*  
of  
a  
Chevron  
oil  
tanker  <ARG1
after  
her  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
beseech*  
you  >ARG0
to  
transfer*  
a  
sum  >ARG1
equaling*  
ten  
to  
twenty  
-  
five  
percent  <ARG2
(  
10  
-  
25  
%  
)  
of  
your  
yearly  
income  
to  
our  
account  <<ARG2
to  
aid*  
in  
this  
important  
venture  <ARG1
.  

The  
Internal  
Revenue  
Service  >ARG0

will  >ARGM-MOD
function*  
as  
our  
trusted*  
intermediary  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
propose*  
that  
you  >>ARG0
make*  >ARGM-LVB
this  
transfer*  
before  
the  
fifteenth  <ARGM-TMP
(  
15th  
)  
of  
the  
month  
of  
April  
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
that  
a  
transaction*  >ARG0
of  
this  
magnitude  <ARGM-ADJ
would  >ARGM-MOD
make*  
anyone  >ARG1
apprehensive  <ARG1
and  
worried*  
.  

But  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
assuring*  
you  <ARG1
that  
all  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
well*  
at  
the  
end*  
of  
the  
day  <ARG1
.  

A  
bold  >ARGM-ADJ
step*  >>ARG1
taken*  
shall  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
regretted*  >ARG2
,  
I  >ARG0
assure*  
you  <ARG1
.  

Please  >>ARGM-DIS
do*  
be*  
informed*  
that  
this  
business  >ARG1
transaction*  >>ARG1
is*  
100  
%  >ARGM-EXT
legal*  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
wish*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
co-operate*  
in  
this  
transaction*  
,  
please  >ARGM-DIS
contact*  
our  
intermediary  
representatives  <ARG1
to  
further  >ARGM-EXT
discuss*  
the  
matter  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
pray*  
that  
you  >ARG0
understand*  
our  
plight  <ARG1
.  

My  
family  >>ARG0
and  
our  
colleagues  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
forever  >ARGM-TMP
grateful*  
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ

Let*  
me  >ARG0
add*  
some  
additional  
info  <ARG1

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
details  <ARG1

here  <<ARGM-LOC

from

in

if

Let*  
me  >ARG0
put*  
it  <ARG1
this  
way  <ARGM-MNR

If  
you  >>ARG0

you  >>ARG0

the  
rewards  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1

Also  >ARGM-DIS

a

China  >ARG0
's  
insatiable  >ARGM-ADJ
demand*  >>ARG0
for  
energy  <ARG1
is*  
prompting*  
fears*  
of  
financial  >ARG0
and  
diplomatic  
collisions*  
around  
the  
globe  <<ARGM-LOC
as  
it  >ARG0
seeks*  
reliable  >ARGM-ADJ
supplies*  
of  
oil  <ARG1
from  
as  
far  
away  <ARGM-DIR
as  
Brazil  
and  
Sudan  
.  

An  
intrusion*  >>ARG1
into  
Japanese  
territorial  
waters  <ARG2
by  
a  
Chinese  
nuclear  
submarine  <ARG0
last  
week  <ARGM-TMP
and  
a  
trade  >ARG2
deal*  
with  
Brazil  <ARG1
are*  
the  
latest  
apparently  
unconnected  
consequences  <ARG2
of  
China  
's  
soaring*  
economic  
growth  <ARG1
.  

Increased  
car  
usage  >>ARG0
in  
China  
is*  
creating*  
a  
high  >ARGM-EXT
demand*  
for  
petrol  <ARG1

The  
connection*  >ARG1
,  
however  >ARGM-ADV
,  
lies*  
in  
an  
order*  >ARG1
issued*  
last  
year  <ARGM-TMP
by  
President  <ARG0
Hu  
Jintao  
to  
seek*  
secure  >ARGM-ADJ
oil  >ARG1
supplies*  
abroad  <<ARGM-LOC
-  
preferably  
ones  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
stopped*  
by  
America  <ARG0
in  
case*  
of  <ARG1
conflict*  
over  
Taiwan  <ARG2
.  

The  
submarine  
incident  >>ARG1
was*  
put*  
down  <ARGM-DIR
to  
a  
"  
technical  >ARGM-ADJ
error*  
"  
by  
the  
Chinese  
government  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
apologised*  
to  
Japan  <ARG2
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
even  
before  
the  
incident  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
People  
's  
Daily  >>ARG0
,  
the  
government  
mouthpiece  
,  
had*  
commented*  
that  
competition*  >ARG1
over  
the  
East  
China  
Sea  <ARG2
between  
the  
two  
countries  <ARG0
was*  
"  
only  <ARGM-ADV
a  
prelude  <ARG2
of  
the  
game  
between  
China  
and  
Japan  
in  
the  
arena  
of  
international  
energy  
"  
.  

The  
Brazil  >ARG0
trade  >ARG2
deal*  >ARG2
included*  
funding*  
for  
a  
joint  
oil  >ARG3
-  
drilling*  
and  
pipeline  
programme  <<ARG1
at  
a  
cost  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
experts  >ARG0
said*  
would  >ARGM-MOD
add*  
up  
to  
three  
times  
the  
cost  <ARG2
of  
simply  >ARGM-ADV
buying*  
oil  <ARG1
on  
the  
market  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
West  >>ARG0
,  
however  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
has*  
paid*  >ARGM-LVB
little  >ARGM-ADJ
attention*  
to  
these  
developments*  
.  

For  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
United  
States  >>ARG1
and  
Europe  
are*  
far  
more  >ARGM-EXT
concerned*  
with  
the  
even  
more  
sensitive  >ARGM-ADJ
issues*  
of  
China  >ARG0
's  
relations*  
with  
"  
pariah  
states  <ARG2
"  
.  

In  
September  >ARGM-TMP
,  
China  >>ARG0
threatened*  
to  
veto*  
any  
move*  
to  
impose*  
sanctions  <ARG1
on  
Sudan  <ARG2
over  
the  
atrocities  <ARGM-CAU
in  
Darfur  
.  

It  >>ARG0
has*  
invested*  
$  <ARG1
3  
billion  
in  
the  
African  
country  
's  
oil  
industry  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
supplies*  
it  <ARG2
with  
seven  
per  
cent  <ARG1
of  
its  >ARG0
needs*  
.  

Then  >ARGM-ADV
,  
this  
month  >ARGM-TMP
,  
it  >ARG0
said*  
that  
it  >ARG0
opposed*  
moves*  
to  
refer*  
Iran  >ARG0
's  
nuclear  >ARG1
stand*  
-  
off  <C-V
with  
the  
International  
Atomic  
Energy  
Agency  <ARG2
to  
the  
United  
Nations  
Security  
Council  <<ARG2
.  

A  
week  
before  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
China  
's  
second  
biggest  
state  
oil  
firm  >>ARG0
had*  
signed*  
a  
$  >ARG3
70  
billion  
deal*  
for  
oilfield  >ARG1
and  
natural  
gas  
development*  
with  
Iran  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
already  >ARGM-TMP
supplies*  
13  
per  
cent  <ARG1
of  
China  >ARG0
's  
needs*  
.  

China  >>ARG1
has*  
its  
own  
reserves  <ARG1
of  
oil  
and  
natural  
gas  
and  
once  >ARGM-TMP
was*  
a  
net  
oil  
exporter  <ARG2
.  

But  
as  
its  
economy  >>ARG1
has*  
expanded*  
by  
an  
average  <ARG2
of  
nine  
per  
cent  
per  
year  
for  
the  
last  
two  
decades  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  
has*  
its  >ARG0
demand*  
for  
energy  <ARG1
.  

This  
year  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG0
overtook*  
Japan  <ARG1
as  
the  
world  
's  
second  
largest  
consumer  <ARGM-PRD
of  
energy  
,  
behind  
the  
US  
.  

Its  >ARG0
projected  >ARGM-PRD
demand*  >>ARG0
,  
boosted*  
by  
a  
huge  >ARG2
rise*  
in  
car  >ARG1
ownership*  
as  
well  
as  
the  
need*  
to  
find*  
alternatives  <ARG1
to  
polluting  
coal  
for  
electricity  >ARG1
generation*  
,  
has*  
contributed*  
to  
the  
surge*  
in  
the  
price*  
of  
oil  <ARG1
this  
year  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Shortages  >>ARG0
are*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
leading*  
to  
power  >ARG1
cuts*  
in  
the  
big  
cities  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

Since  
President  >ARG0
Hu  
ordered*  >>ARGM-TMP
state  
-  
owned  
oil  
firms  >>ARG0
to  
"  
go*  
abroad  <ARG4
"  
to  
ensure*  
supply*  
,  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
begun*  
drilling*  
for  
gas  <ARG3
in  
the  
East  
China  
Sea  <ARGM-LOC
,  
just  <ARGM-LOC
west  
of  
the  
line  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
Japan  >ARG0
regards*  
as  
its  
border  <ARG2
.  

Japan  >ARG0
protested*  
,  
to  
no  
avail  <ARGM-ADV
,  
that  
the  
project  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
joint  
one  <ARG2
.  

The  
two  >>ARG0
are*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
set*  
to  
clash*  
over  
Russia  
's  
oil  
wealth  <ARG2
.  

China  >ARG1
is*  
furious  <ARG2
that  
Japan  >>ARG0
has*  
outbid*  
it  <ARG1
in  
their  >ARG0
battle*  >ARGM-ADV
to  
determine*  
the  
route  <ARG1
of  
the  
pipeline  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
Russia  >>ARG0
intends*  
to  
build*  
to  
the  
Far  
East  
.  

Japan  
favoured  
a  
route  
to  
the  
sea  
,  
enabling*  
oil  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
shipped*  
to  
both  
Japan  <ARG2
and  
China  
.  

China  >ARG0
wanted*  
an  
overland  
route  >ARG0
through  
its  
own  
territory  
,  
which  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
give*  
it  <ARG2
ultimate  >ARGM-ADJ
control*  
if  
hostilities  >ARG1
broke*  
out  
.  

Increasingly  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
analysts  >>ARG0
are*  
saying*  
that  
China  >ARG0
's  
efforts*  >>ARG1
have*  
gone*  
beyond  
what  >ARG1

safe  <ARG2
or

Visualizations*  
as  
a  
helpful  
beginning  
technique  <ARGM-ADJ

-----------------------------------------------  

If  
you  >ARG0
consider*  >>ARGM-ADV
that  
you  >>ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
need*  
the  
assistance*  
of  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
visualizations*  
to  
help*  
the  
mind  >ARG0
feel*  
the  
spirit  <ARG1
of  
transcendence  
,  
try*  
the  
following  <ARG1
before  
moving*  
onto  
the  
more  
formal  
method  <ARG2
below  
.  

Visualisations  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
as  
useful  
tools  <ARG2
,  
but  
meditation*  >ARG1
is*  
more  <ARG2
than  
that  
.  

Meditation*  >>ARG0
has*  
to  
do*  
with  
what  >>ARG1
is*  
called*  
ideation*  
.  

It  
is*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
good*  
to  
stick*  
to  
a  
formal  
intense  >ARGM-ADJ
meditation*  
practice  <<ARG2
like  
the  
one  >ARG1
for  
beginners  
described*  
in  
the  
MP3  
file  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
follows*  
after  
the  
visualisations  <ARG2
.  

Find*  
a  
comfortable  
place  <ARG1
on  
the  
floor  
and  
sit*  
with  
your  
legs  >ARG1
crossed*  
.  

Place*  
your  
hands  <ARG1
one  <ARG2
on  
top  
of  
the  
other  
in  
your  
lap  <ARGM-LOC
,  
keep*  
your  
back  >ARG1
straight*  
,  
eyes  >ARG1
closed*  
and  
tongue  
on  
the  
roof  
of  
your  
mouth  
.  

Your  >ARG0
breathing*  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
calm  <ARG2
and  
relaxed  
,  
through  
the  
nose  
.  

Spend*  
a  
minute  <ARG1
or  
so  
concentrating*  
on  
your  >ARG0
breath*  
,  
feeling*  
the  
air  >ARG1
flowing*  
through  
your  
nostrils  <ARGM-DIR
.  

1  
.  
Warm  
Sun  >ARG1
Visualization*  

Continue*  
to  
breathe*  
slowly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
deeply  
.  

With  
each  
breath*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
feel*  
the  
muscles  >>ARG1
in  
your  
body  
becoming*  
lighter*  
and  
lighter*  
,  
and  
also  >>ARGM-ADV
your  
external  
motor  
and  
sensory  
organs  >>ARG0
are*  
feeling*  
like  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
withdrawing*  
from  
the  
world  <ARG2
into  
a  
special  
inner  
quietness  <ARGM-DIR
.  

Imagine*  
the  
tension*  >ARG1
melting*  
away  <ARGM-PRD
as  
you  >>ARG0
continue*  
breathing*  
rhythmically  <ARGM-MNR
and  
naturally  
.  

Picture*  
yourself  >>ARG0
sitting*  
on  
a  
warm  
,  
tropical  
beach  <ARG2
basking*  
in  
the  
glow  <ARG1
of  
the  
sun  
...  
.  

Visualize*  
the  
vivid  
,  
beautiful  
colours  <ARG1
of  
the  
earth  
(  
its  
flowers  
and  
plants  
)  
,  
the  
sea  
next  
to  
you  
,  
and  
the  
sky  
above  
you  
.  

Feel*  
yourself  <ARG1
floating*  
above  
the  
earth  <ARGM-LOC
and  
sea  
.  

As  
you  >ARG1
sit*  >>ARGM-ADV
above  
the  
world  <ARG2
,  
the  
warmth  >>ARG0
of  
the  
golden  
sun  
penetrates*  
your  
body  <ARG1
and  
makes*  
you  >>ARG1
feel*  
warmer*  
and  
warmer*  
.  

It  >ARG1
surrounds*  
you  <ARG2
.  

The  
golden  
rays  >>ARG1
feel*  
soft*  
and  
soothing  
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
are*  
far  
above  
the  
earth  <ARG2
-  
into  
space  
.  

Everything  >ARG1
around  
you  
is*  
so  
vast  <ARG2
.  

Yet  
,  
there  
is*  
warmth  <ARG1
and  
a  
familiarity  
with  
the  
vastness  
.  

You  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
merge*  
your  
mind  <ARG1
with  
the  
greater  
universal  
Mind  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
surrounds*  
you  <ARG2
.  

Continue*  
to  
ideate  <ARG1
on  
this  
intense  
desire  
for  
your  
mind  >ARG1
to  
merge*  
with  
the  
that  
universal  
Consciousness  <ARG2
.  

And  
while  
doing*  >ARGM-TMP
so  <ARG1
continue*  
using*  
the  
Baba  
Nam  
Kevalam  
mantra  <ARG1
(  
breathe*  
in  <ARG2
with  
Baba  <ARGM-MNR
Nam  
,  
breathe*  
out  <ARG2
with  
Kevalam  <ARGM-MNR
)  
.  

Try*  
this  <ARG1
for  
5  
to  
10  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
come*  
back  <ARG4
to  
earth  
again  <ARGM-ADV
-  
slowly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Imagine*  
yourself  <ARG1
sitting*  
on  
the  
beach  <ARG2
serenely  <ARGM-MNR
and  
restfully  
.  

Your  
muscles  >>ARG1
are*  
loose*  
and  
limp  
.  

Feel*  
your  
body  >>ARG0
sinking*  
slightly  <ARG2
into  
the  
sand  <ARGM-DIR
making*  >ARGM-LVB
that  
earthly  >ARG2
connection*  
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
sun  
's  
rays  >>ARG1
and  
warmth  
are*  
still  <ARGM-TMP
with  
you  <ARG2
,  
surrounding*  
you  <ARG2
.  

You  >ARG1
are*  
in  
a  
state  <ARG2
of  
peace*  
and  
relaxation*  
.  

With  
each  
breath*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
watch*  
your  
body  <ARG1
and  
ensure*  
that  
it  >ARG1
remains*  
relaxed  <ARG3
-  
at  
peace*  
.  

Continue*  
to  
feel*  
the  
warmth  >ARG0
of  
the  
sunlight  
all  
over  
your  
body  <ARGM-LOC
,  
warming*  
you  <ARG1
deeply  <ARGM-MNR
and  
gently  
.  

You  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
bring*  
something  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
with  
you  <ARGM-COM
from  
your  >ARG0
deep  
space  >ARG1
experience*  >ARGM-LOC
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
you  >ARG0
sensed*  
your  
mind  >ARG1
merging*  
with  
the  
universal  
Mind  <ARG2
.  

This  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
warmth  <ARG2
of  
the  
sun  
-  
a  
close  
reminder  
and  
link  
between  
earth  
and  
the  
infinite  
space  
.  

Visualize*  
the  
inside  <ARG1
of  
your  
body  
bathed*  
in  
the  
golden  
light  <ARG2
,  
absorbing*  
every  
ray  <ARG1
and  
glowing*  
as  
radiantly  <ARGM-MNR
as  
the  
sun  
.  

A  
warm  
,  
gentle  
breeze  >>ARG0
swirls*  
around  
your  
body  <ARGM-LOC
and  
relaxes*  
you  <ARG1
even  
more  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Let*  
your  
mind  >ARG1
and  
body  
be*  
totally  
at  
peace*  
.  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
feel*  
yourself  >ARG1
returning*  
to  
where  >ARG2
you  >ARG1
sit*  
...  
move*  
your  
hands  <ARG1
and  
feet  
a  
little  <ARGM-EXT
,  
stretch*  
them  <ARG1
.  

Open*  
your  
eyes  <ARG1
.  

2  
.  
Mountain  >ARG1
Visualization*  

Another  
thing  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
try*  
.  

Imagine*  
you  >>ARG1
're*  
sitting*  
on  
top  <ARG2
of  
a  
mountain  
,  
and  
that  
it  >ARG1
's*  
the  
most  
peaceful  
place  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
think*  
of  <C-ARG1
.  

Feel*  
that  
you  >>ARG1
're*  
sitting*  
there  <ARG2
in  
complete  >ARGM-EXT
peace*  
,  
right  
on  
top  <<ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
world  
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
imagine*  
that  
infinite  
happiness  >>ARG1
is*  
surrounding*  
you  <ARG2
in  
every  
direction  <ARGM-DIR
.  

Feel*  
you  >>ARG2
're*  
completely  >ARGM-EXT
surrounded*  
by  
that  
infinite  >ARGM-EXT
peace*  
and  
happiness  
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
start*  
to  
repeat*  
within  
your  
mind  <ARGM-MNR
the  
mantra  <ARG1
:  
BABA  
NAM  
KEVALAM  
.  

Its  >ARG1
meaning*  >ARG1
is*  
"  
Infinite  
happiness  >ARG1
is*  
everywhere  <ARG2
"  
.  

Feel*  
the  
meaning*  
,  
do*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
just  >>ARGM-ADV
think*  
of  
its  >ARG1
wordy  >ARGM-ADJ
meaning*  
or  
try*  
to  
translate*  
from  
Sanskrit  <ARG3
(  
BABA  
NAM  
KEVALAM  
)  
to  
an  
English  >ARGM-ADJ
meaning*  
(  
Infinite  >ARGM-EXT
peace*  
and  
happiness  
)  
.  

Think*  
internally  <ARGM-MNR
,  
intuitively  <ARGM-MNR
,  
not  
by  
words  <ARGM-MNR
,  
of  
the  
meaning*  
,  
as  
you  >>ARG0
're*  
repeating*  
it  <ARG1
.  

This  >>ARG1
is*  
called*  
ideation*  
.  

It  
is*  
important*  
to  
take*  
the  
idea  <ARG1
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADJ
the  
intellectual  >ARGM-MNR
analysis*  
.  

Touching*  >ARG1
deep  
into  
the  
idea  <ARG1
is*  
what  >ARG0
builds*  
intuition*  
-  
it  >ARG1
is*  
a  
synthetic  >ARGM-ADJ
process*  
.  

Whereas  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
trying*  >>ARG1
to  
translate*  
and  
grapple*  
with  <ARG1
wordy  >ARGM-ADJ
meanings*  
is*  
an  
intellectual  
mechanism  <ARG2
-  
an  
analytical  >ARGM-ADJ
process*  
.  

Feel*  
you  >>ARG2
're*  
surrounded*  
by  
infinite  >ARGM-EXT
peace*  
and  
happiness  
,  
and  
feel*  
that  
your  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-ADJ
sense*  >ARG1
of  
existence  <ARG1
is*  
in  
direct  >ARGM-MNR
contact*  
with  
that  
endless  >ARGM-EXT
peace*  
and  
happiness  
all  
around  
you  <ARGM-LOC
.  

You  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
go*  
further  <ARGM-PRD
and  
feel*  
that  
your  
unit  
consciousness  >>ARG1
,  
a  
dot  
in  
the  
Infinite  
Consciousness  
,  
is*  
merging*  
with  
Infinity  <ARG2
.  

Continue*  
for  
as  
long  <ARGM-TMP
as  
you  >ARG0
like*  
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
open*  
your  
eyes  <ARG1
.  

OK  >ARGM-DIS
that  >ARG1
is*  
fairly  
basic  <ARG2
:)  
.  

The  
important  
point  >ARG1
is*  
to  
develop*  
some  
psycho-spiritual  >ARG3
connection*  
between  
your  
mind  <ARG1
and  
the  
universal  
Consciousness  
or  
Supreme  
Consciousness  
.  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
worry*  
if  
you  >>ARG0
have*  
trouble  <ARG1
concentrating*  
on  
the  
mantra  <ARG1
and  
ideation*  
-  
that  >>ARG1
's*  
normal*  
.  

It  
takes*  
some  
time  <ARG1
and  
practice  
to  
be*  
able*  
to  
focus*  
on  
the  
one  
thought*  
.  

The  
main  
thing  >ARG1
is*  
to  
keep*  
practicing*  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
practice*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
nothing  >ARG1
happens*  
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
a  
miracle  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
happen*  
,  
but  
let*  
s  >ARG0
face*  
it  <ARG1
we  >>ARG0
're*  
ordinary  
people  <ARG2
and  
so  >ARGM-ADV
require*  
practical  
day  
to  
day  
techniques  <ARG1

From  
what  >>ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0

the  
news

one  >ARG0

But  
that  >ARG1

some

reintroduced*  
in  
the

Marriage  
Equality  
Declaration*  
of  
Religious  
Leaders  <C-ARG0
April  <ARGM-TMP
19  
,  
2004  

The  
most  
fundamental  >ARGM-ADJ
human  >ARG1
right*  >ARG1
,  
after  
the  
necessities  <ARGM-ADJ
of  
food  
,  
clothing  
and  
shelter  
,  
is*  
the  
right*  
to  
affection*  
and  
the  
supportive  >ARGM-ADJ
love*  
of  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
human  >ARG1
beings*  
.  

We  >>ARG1
become*  
most  
fully  >ARGM-ADV
human*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
love*  
another  
person  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
grow*  
in  
our  
capacity  <ARG2
to  
be*  
human*  
-  
to  
be*  
loving  <ARG2
-  
in  
a  
family  
unit  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

This  
right*  >>ARG1
to  
love*  
and  
form*  
a  
family  <ARG1
is*  
so  >ARGM-CXN
fundamental*  
that  
our  
United  
States  
Constitution  >ARG0
takes*  
it  >ARG1
for  
granted*  
in  
its  >ARG0
dedication*  
to  
"  
secure*  
the  
blessings*  
of  
liberty  <ARG2
to  
ourselves  <ARG1
and  
our  
posterity  
.  
”  

The  
North  
Carolina  
Constitution  >ARG0
likewise  >ARGM-ADV
affirms*  
the  
“  
inalienable  >ARGM-ADJ
rights*  
”  
of  
human  >ARG1
beings*  
to  
"  
life  <<ARG2
,  
liberty  
,  
the  
enjoyment  
of  
the  
fruits  
of  
their  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-ADJ
labor*  
,  
and  
the  
pursuit*  
of  
happiness  <ARG1
.  
"  

Throughout  
history  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
tyrants  >>ARG0
have*  
known*  
that  
by  
denying*  >>ARG2
the  
right*  
of  
oppressed  
peoples  <ARG1
to  
form*  
and  
nurture*  
families  <ARG1
,  
they  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
kill*  
the  
spirit  <ARG1
of  
those  
peoples  
.  

>  
From  
the  
shameful  
history  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
slavery  
in  
America  
,  
the  
injustice  >>ARG1
of  
forbidding*  
people  >ARG1
to  
marry*  
is*  
evident*  
as  
a  
denial  <ARGM-MNR
of  
a  
basic  >ARGM-ADJ
human  >ARG1
right*  
.  

The  
American  
laws  >>ARG0
forbidding*  
interracial  >ARGM-ADJ
marriage*  
,  
now  >ARGM-TMP
struck*  
down  
,  
were*  
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
discriminatory*  
.  

Denial  >>ARG0
of  
the  
status  
of  
marriage*  
to  
those  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
freely  >ARGM-MNR
accept*  
its  
responsibilities  <ARG1
creates*  
legal  
and  
economic  
inequities  <ARG1
and  
social  
injustice  
.  

We  >>ARG0
feel*  
called*  
to  
protest*  
and  
oppose*  
this  
injustice  <ARG1
.  

As  
religious  
people  >>ARGM-MNR
,  
clergy  
and  
lay  
leaders  
,  
we  >>ARG0
are*  
mandated*  
by  
faith  <ARG0
to  
stand*  
for  
justice  <ARG1
in  
our  
common  
civic  
life  <ARG2
.  

We  >ARG0
oppose*  
the  
use*  >ARG0
of  
sacred  
texts  <ARG1
and  
religious  
traditions  
to  
deny*  
legal  
equity  <ARG1
to  
same  
-  
gender  
couples  <ARG2
.  

As  
concerned  
citizens  >ARGM-PRD
we  >ARG0
affirm*  
the  
liberty  <ARG1
of  
adults  
of  
the  
same  
gender  
to  
love*  
and  
marry*  
.  

We  >ARG0
insist*  
that  
no  
one  >>ARG0
,  
especially  
the  
state  
,  
is*  
allowed*  
to  
coerce*  
people  <ARG1
into  
marriage*  
or  
bar*  
two  
consenting  
adults  <ARG1
,  
whether  
of  
the  
same  <ARGM-ADV
or  
differing  
genders  
,  
from  
forming*  
the  
family  
unit  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
lets*  
them  >>ARG1
be*  
more  
fully  
loving  <ARG2
,  
thus  >ARGM-ADV
more  
fully  >ARGM-ADV
human*  
.  

We  >ARG0
respect*  
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
debate*  >>ARG1
and  
discussion*  
continue*  
in  
many  <ARGM-LOC
of  
our  
religious  
communities  
as  
to  
the  
scriptural  >ARGM-ADJ
,  
theological  
and  
liturgical  
issues*  >ARG1
involved*  
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
we  >>ARG1
draw*  
on  
our  
many  
faith  
traditions  <ARG2
to  
arrive*  
at  
a  
common  >ARGM-ADJ
conviction*  
.  

We  >>ARG0
are*  
resolved*  
that  
the  
State  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
interfere*  
with  
same  
-  
gender  
couples  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
choose*  
to  
marry*  
and  
share*  
fully  <ARGM-MNR
and  
equally  
in  
the  
rights*  
,  
responsibilities  
,  
and  
commitments*  
of  
civil  >ARGM-ADJ
marriage*  
.  

We  >ARG0
affirm*  
freedom  <ARG1
of  
conscience  
in  
this  
matter  <ARGM-ADV
.  

We  >ARG0
recognize*  
that  
the  
state  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
require*  
religious  
groups  >>ARG0
to  
officiate*  
at  <ARG1
,  
or  
bless*  
,  
same  
-  
gender  >ARGM-ADJ
marriages*  
.  

Likewise  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
a  
denial  >>ARG0
of  
state  >ARGM-LOC
civil  >ARGM-MNR
recognition*  
dishonors*  
the  
religious  >ARG2
convictions*  
of  
those  
communities  >>ARG0
and  
clergy  
who  >>R-ARG0
officiate*  
at  <ARG1
,  
and  
bless*  
,  
same  
-  
gender  >ARGM-ADJ
marriages*  
.  

The  
state  
may  
not  
favor  
the  
convictions*  
of  
one  
religious  
group  <ARG0
over  
another  
by  
denying*  
individuals  <ARG2
their  >ARG1
fundamental  >ARGM-ADJ
right*  
to  
marry*  
and  
to  
have*  
those  
marriages*  >ARG1
recognized*  
by  
civil  
law  <ARG0
.  

As  
faith  
leaders  >ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >ARG0
commit*  
ourselves  <ARG1
to  
public  >ARG0
action*  
,  
visibility  
,  
education*  
,  
and  
mutual  >ARGM-MNR
support*  
in  
the  
service*  
of  
the  
right*  
and  
freedom  
to  
marry*

The  
One  
Reason  >ARGM-CAU
Why  >R-ARGM-CAU
All  
Americans  >ARG0
Should  >ARGM-MOD
Oppose*  
The  
Nomination*  
Of  
Samuel  <ARG1
Alito  

He  >>ARG0
Would  >ARGM-MOD
Tear*  
Down  
Our  
System  <ARG1
Of  
Checks*  
And  
Balances  
,  
Giving*  
Far  
Too  
Much  
Power  <ARG1
To  
The  
President  <ARG2

My  
Fellow  
Americans  
:  

As  
many  >>ARG0
of  
you  
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
heard*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
President  >>ARG0
Bush  
has*  
nominated*  
a  
long  
-  
time  
Federal  
Judge  >>ARG2
named*  
Samuel  <ARG2
Alito  
to  
become*  
the  
next  
member  <ARG2
of  
the  
United  
States  
Supreme  
Court  
,  
to  
fill*  
a  
vacancy  >ARG1
created*  
by  
the  
retirement*  
of  
another  
member  <ARG0
of  
the  
Court  
.  

Under  
our  
Constitution  >>ARGM-CAU
,  
this  
nomination*  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
take*  >ARGM-LVB
effect*  
unless  
and  
until  
the  
United  
States  
Senate  >ARG0
gives*  
its  
Consent  <ARG1
,  
as  
described*  
in  
our  
Constitution  <ARGM-LOC
,  
Article  
II  
,  
Section  
2  
.

the  
Constitution  <ARG1

Judge  
Samuel  >ARG1
Alito  
is*  
very  
highly  
qualified  <ARG2
by  
all  <ARGM-PRD
of  
the  
normal  
standards  >ARG1
used*  
to  
evaluate*  
candidates  <ARG1
for  
this  
position  
:  

He  >ARG0
has*  
a  
very  
high  
intellect  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG1
graduated*  
very  
high  <ARGM-ADV
in  
his  
class  <ARGM-LOC
,  
from  
Princeton  
undergraduate  <ARG0
and  
from  
Law  
School  
at  
Yale  
.  

He  >ARG0
has*  
a  
long  
and  
distinguished  
record  <ARG1
,  
including  
many  
years  
as  
a  
Federal  
Appeals  
Judge  
,  
the  
next  
level  
below  
Supreme  
Court  
.  

He  >ARG0
has*  
encyclopedic  
knowledge  <ARG1
of  
hundreds  
of  
different  >ARGM-ADJ
Supreme  
Court  >ARGM-LOC
cases*  
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
recite*  
details  <ARG1
from  
memory  <ARGM-MNR
.  

He  >>ARG0
demonstrates*  
an  
excellent  
"  
Judicial  
Temperament  <ARG1
,  
"  
being*  
courteous  <ARG2
,  
mild  
-  
mannered  
,  
respectful  
of  
all  
people  
;  
careful*  
in  
his  >ARG0
work*  
,  
meticulous  
in  
detail  
.  

His  
co-workers  >ARG0
love*  
him  <ARG1
.  

His  
fellow  
judges  >ARG0
love*  
him  <ARG1
.  

His  
family  >ARG0
loves*  
him  <ARG1
.  

President  >ARG0
Bush  
loves*  
him  <ARG1
.  

Yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
it  
is*  
true*  
that  
some  
people  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like*  
the  
way  >>ARGM-MNR
they  >ARG0
think*  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
vote*  
on  
the  
Supreme  
Court  <ARG1
.  

But  
other  
people  >>ARG0
do*  
like*  
the  
way  >>ARGM-MNR
they  >ARG0
think*  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
vote*  
,  
and  
the  
ones  >>ARG1
who  >R-ARG0
favor*  
him  <ARG1
seem*  
to  
outnumber*  
the  
ones  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
oppose*  
him  <ARG1
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
now  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
Senate  >>ARG0
is*  
getting*  
ready*  
to  
vote*  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
,  
on  
whether  
to  
approve*  
him  <ARG1
or  
not  
;  
and  
at  
this  
moment  >ARGM-TMP
(  
evening  
of  
Jan.  
27  
,  
2006  
)  
it  >ARG0
looks*  
like  
he  >ARG0
has*  
more  <ARG1
than  
the  
fifty  
-  
one  >ARG2
votes*  >ARG1
needed*  
for  
approval*  
.  

The  
President  >>ARG0
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
eager*  
to  
go*  
ahead  <ARG2
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
get*  
this  
vote*  
,  
because  
he  >>ARG0
very  
much  >ARGM-EXT
wants*  
to  
have*  
Samuel  >>ARG0
Alito  
on  
the  
Supreme  
Court  <ARG1
,  
to  
be*  
judging*  
the  
cases*  >>ARG2
Bush  >>ARG1
is*  
interested*  
in  <C-ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
there  
is*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
hurry*  
-  
up  <ARGM-PRD
pressure  
on  
the  
Senate  
to  
give*  
its  >ARG0
prompt  >ARGM-ADJ
vote*  
of  
approval*  
.  

There  
is*  
an  
old  
saying  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
applies*  
in  
this  
situation  <ARG2
:  
"  
Act*  
in  
haste  <ARGM-MNR
,  
repent*  
at  
leisure  <ARGM-TMP
.  
"  

Sometimes  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
make*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
decision*  
very  
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
regret*  
it  <ARG1
for  
many  
years  >ARG1
to  
come*  
.  

That  >ARG1
is*  
what  >>ARG1
is*  
about  <ARG2
to  
happen*  
with  
Judge  
Samuel  <<ARGM-ADV
Alito  
,  
in  
my  
opinion  <<ARGM-ADV
,  
because  
he  >ARG0
has*  
one  
tragic  >ARGM-ADJ
flaw*  >>ARG0
-  
a  
very  
serious  
blind  
spot  
in  
his  >ARG0
thinking*  
-  
which  >R-ARG0
makes*  
him  >ARG1
completely  >ARGM-EXT
unacceptable*  
for  
the  
position  <ARG3
of  
Supreme  
Court  
Justice  
:  
He  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-ADV
agree*

,  
Giving*  
Far  
Too  
Much

"  

In  
our  
Constitutional  
system  >ARGM-LOC
,  
we  >ARG0
have*  
three  
branches  <ARG1
of  
the  
Federal  
Government  
:  
the  
Legislative  
,  
Executive

the  
basic  
idea  >>ARG1
behind  
the

we  >ARG0

is*  
that  
if  
one

,  
the

But  >ARGM-DIS
Samuel  >ARG0

believes*  
in  
a  
little  
-  
known  
Constitutional  
theory  >>ARG0
-  
called*  
the  
"  
Unitary  
Executive  
Theory  <ARG2

-  
which  >R-ARG0
says*  
that  
the  
President  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  >ARGM-LVB
complete  >ARGM-EXT
control*  
over  
the  
Executive  
Branch  <ARG1
,  
and  
that  
the  
Executive  
Branch  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
in  
charge*  
of  
almost  
everything  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
the  
Government  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
does*  
,  
including  
the  
functions*  
of  
the  
Independent  
Agencies  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
were*  
designed*  
to  
be*  
free*  
of  
Presidential  >ARG0
control*  
,  
and  
the  
Military  >>ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
exists*  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
regulated*  
,  
and  
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
funded*  
by  
specific  
authority  >ARG1
given*  
by  
the  
Constitution  <ARG0
to  
Congress  <ARG2
,  
not  
to  
the  
President  
.  

The  
Military  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
Executive  
Branch  
:  
it  >ARG1
is*  
a  
separate  
entity  <ARG2
.  

"  
Commander  >>ARG1
In  
Chief  
"  
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
mean*  
that  
he  >ARG1

the  
boss  <ARG2
of  
the  
Military  
,  
merely  
that  
he  >ARG1

the

just

he  >>ARG1
is*  
the

charged*  
with  
"

faithfully  <ARGM-MNR
"  
all  
the  
laws  >ARG1
passed*  
by  
Congress  <ARG0
and  
all  
the  
Decisions*  >ARG1
rendered*  
by  
the  
Supreme

Under  
the  
Unitary  
Executive  
Theory  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
Laws  >>ARG0
of  
Congress  
and  
Decisions*  
of  
the  
Supreme  
Court  <ARG0
have*  
no  
actual  
authority  <ARG1
unless  
the  
President  >ARG0
agrees*  
with  
them  <ARG2
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
so  >ARGM-DIS
Congress  >ARG1
and  
the  
Supreme  
Court  
become*  
mere  
advisors  <ARG2
to  
the  
President  
,  
with  
no  
real  
authority  
over  
him  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
the

a  
Dictator  >ARG1

unrestrained  
by  
anything

,  
backed*  
up  
by

entirely  
under  
his  >ARG0

And  >ARGM-DIS
thus  >ARGM-DIS

The

I  >>ARG1

If

why  >>ARGM-CAU

I  >>ARG0

Hi  
there  
,  

I  >ARG0
read*  
the  
Civet

story  <ARG1
from  
a  
little  
while  
ago  
,  
and  
tonight  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
my  
Mom  >ARG0
emailed*  >>ARGM-TMP
me  <ARG2
about  
it  <ARG1
,  
I  >>ARG0
re-read*  
it  <ARG1

went*  
to

with  
the  
song  >>ARG1
the  
author  >>ARG0
of  
the  
email*

.  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
sure  >>ARGM-ADV
enough  
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
heard*  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
cats  >ARG0
"  
Meowing*  
,  
"  
I  >>ARG0
imagined*  
the  
hellish  
moments  >>ARG1
these  
poor  
beautiful  
creatures  >>ARG0
of  
God  
were*  
living*  
,  
what  >ARG1
went*  
on  
in  
their  
tiny  
,  
sweet  
little  
minds  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
decided*  
that  
I  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
do*  
something  <ARG1
about  
this  
torture*  
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
anyone  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
give*  >ARGM-ADV
me  <ARG2
some  
advice  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
sure  >ARGM-ADV
appreciate*  
it  <ARG1
!  

I  >ARG0
think*  
for  
starters  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
myself  >>ARG0
and  
those  >ARG0
of  
you  
who  >R-ARG0
believe*  
in  
God  <ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
a  
special  
prayer  <ARG1
for  
them  
.  

I  
will  
.  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
pasted*  
the  
email*  
for  
those  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
have*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seen*  
or  
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
re-read*  
it  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG0
's*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
got*  
the  
website  >>ARG2
where  >>R-ARG2
the  
song  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
uploaded*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
thinking*  
,  
that  
while  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
sitting*  >>ARGM-ADV
here  <ARG2
,  
relaxing*  
and  
enjoying*  
myself  <ARG1
,  
those  
poor  
innocent  
animals  >>ARG1
are*  
being*  
cooked*  
to  
death*  
with  
heat  <<ARGM-MNR
in  
those  
Holocaust-esque  
death  
chambers  <<ARGM-LOC

And  
what  >>ARG1
am*  
I  >ARG0
DOING*  
about  
it  <ARG2

"  
As  
an  
example  >ARGM-ADV

consider*  
the  
treatment*  
of  
the  
civet  
cat  <ARG1
,  
a  
highly  
intelligent  
and  
sociable  
animal  
.  

Civet  
cats  >>ARG1
are*  
trapped*  
and  
placed*  
in  
small  
cages  <ARG2
inside  
darkened*  
sheds  >>ARGM-LOC

where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
the  
temperature  >>ARG1
is*  
kept*  
up  
to  
110

fires*

They  >>ARG1
are*  
confined*  
in  
this  
way  <ARGM-MNR
until  
they  >ARG1
finally  >ARGM-TMP
die*  
.  

What  >ARG0
justifies*  
this  
extraordinary  
mistreatment  <ARG1
?  

These  
animals  >ARG0
have*  
the  
misfortune  <ARG1
to  
produce*  
a  
substance  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is*  
useful*  
in  
the  
manufacture  <ARG2
of  
perfume  
.  

Musk  >>ARG0
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
scraped*  
from  
their

as

the

a

THIS  >ARG1
IS*  
NOT  <ARGM-NEG
A  
SCAM*  
!!!  

I  >>ARG0
found*  
this  <ARG1
on  
a  
bulletin  
board  <ARGM-LOC
and  
decided*  
to  
try*  
it  <ARG1
:  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
care*  
about  
the  
useless  
pre-fabricated  
crap  >ARG1
this

All  >>ARG1

,  
it  >ARG1

.  

Continue*

.  

WELL  >ARGM-DIS
GUESS*  
WHAT  <ARG1
!!!  

Within  
seven  
days  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
started*  
getting*  
money  <ARG1
in  
the  
mail  <ARGM-MNR
!!  

I  >>ARG1
was*  
shocked*  
!!  

I  >ARG0
figured*  
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
end*  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
the  
money  >>ARG1
just  >ARGM-ADV
kept*  
coming*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
.  

In  
my  
first  
week  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
made*  
about  
$  <ARG1
25.00  
.  

By  
the  
end*  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
second

I  >>ARG0
had*  
made*  
a

more  
than  
$  
1000.00  
!!  

In  
the  
third  
week  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
had*  
more  
than  
$  <ARG1
10,000.00  
and  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
still  >ARGM-TMP

now  <ARGM-TMP
my

I  >>ARG0
have*

it  >>ARG1
's*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
coming*  
rapidly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
certainly  <ARGM-ADV
worth  
$  <ARG2
6.00  
and  
six

,  
and  
I  >>ARG0

20  
to  
60  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

This  
program  >>ARG0
remains*  
successful*  
because  
of  
the  
honesty  <ARGM-CAU
and  
integrity  
of  
the  
participants  
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
continue*  
its  >ARG1
success*  
by  
carefully  >ARGM-MNR
adhering*  
to  
the  
instructions*  
.  

You  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
now  >ARGM-TMP
become*  
a  
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
Mail  >ARGM-MNR
Order*  
business  
.  

You  >ARG1
are*  
in  
the  
business  <ARG2
of  
developing*  
Mailing  
Lists  <ARG1
.  

Many  
large  
corporations  >>ARG0
are*  
happy*  
to  
pay*  
big  
bucks  <ARG1
for  
quality  
lists  <ARG3
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
money  >>ARG1
made*  
from  
the  
mailing  
lists  <ARG2
is*  
secondary*  
to  
income  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
made*  
from  
people  >>ARG1
like  
you  
and  
me  
asking*  
to  
be*  
included*  
in  
that  
list  <ARG2
.  

Here  >ARG2
are*  
the  
four  
easy  >ARGM-ADJ
steps*  
to  
success*  
.  

STEP  
ONE  
:  

Get*  
six  
separate  
pieces  <ARG1
of  
paper  
and  
write*  
the  
following  <ARG1
on  
each  
piece  <ARGM-LOC
of  
paper  
"  
PLEASE  >ARGM-DIS
PUT*  
ME  <ARG1
ON  
YOUR  
MAILING  
LIST  <ARG2
.  
"  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
get*  
6  
U.S.  
$  
1.00  
bills  <ARG1
and  
place*  
ONE  <ARG1
inside  
of  
EACH  <ARG2
of  
the  
six  
pieces  
of  
paper  
so  
the  
bill  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
seen*  
through  
the  
envelope  <ARGM-DIR
(  
to  
prevent*  
thievery  <ARG1
)  
.  

Next  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
place*  
one  
paper  <ARG1
in  
each  <ARG2
of  
the  
six  
envelopes  
and  
seal*  
them  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
should  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
six  
sealed*  
envelopes  <ARG1
,  
each  <<ARGM-PRD
with  
a  
piece  >ARG0
of  
paper  
stating*  
the  
above  
phrase  <ARG1
,  
your  
name  
and  
address  
,  
and  
a  
$  
1.00  
bill  
.  

What  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
are*  
doing*  >ARG1
is*  
creating*  
a  
service*  
.  

THIS  >>ARG1
IS*  
ABSOLUTELY  >ARGM-ADV
LEGAL*  
!!!!  
!  

You  >>ARG0
are*  
requesting*  
a  
legitimate  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
and  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
paying*  
for  
it  <ARG3
!!  

Like  
most  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
us  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
skeptical*  
and  
little  >ARGM-EXT
worried*  
about  
the  
legal  
aspects  <ARG0
of  
it  
all  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
checked*  
it  <ARG1
out  <C-V
with  
the  
U.S.  
Post  
Office  <ARGM-MNR
(  
1-800-238-5355  
)  
and  
they  >ARG0
confirmed*  
that  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
indeed  >ARGM-ADV
legal*  
!!  

Mail*  
the

STEP  
TWO  
:  
Now  >>ARGM-TMP
take*  
the  
#  
1  
name  <ARG1
off  <C-V
the  
list  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
you  >ARG0
see*  
above  <ARGM-LOC
,  
move*  
the  
other  
names  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-DIR
(  
six  >ARG1
becomes*  
5  <ARG2
,  
5  >ARG1
becomes*  
4  <ARG2
,  
and  
etc.  
)  
and  
add*  
YOUR  
NAME  <ARG1
as  
number  <ARGM-PRD
6  
on  
the  
list  
.  

STEP  
THREE  
:  

Change*  
anything  <ARG1
you  >ARG0
need*  
to  <ARG1
but  
try*  
to  
keep*  
this  
article  >ARG1
as  >ARGM-CXN
close*  
to  
original  <ARG2
as  
possible  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
post*  
your  
amended  
article  <ARG1
to  
at  
least  
200  
news  
groups  <ARG2
.  
:  

(  
I  >ARG0
think*  
there  
are*  
close  
to  
24,000  
groups  <ARG1
)  

All  >>ARG1
you  >ARG0
need*  
is*  
200  <ARG2
,  
but  
remember*  
,  
the  
more  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
post*  
,  
the  
more  
money  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
make*  
!!  

This  >>ARG1
is*  
perfectly  >ARGM-ADV
legal*  
!!  

If  
you  >>ARG0
have*  >>ARGM-ADV
any  
doubts*  
,  
refer*  
to  
Title  <ARG1
18  
Sec.  
1302  
&  
1341  
of  
the  
Postal  
Lottery  
laws  
.  

Keep*  
a  
copy*  
of  
these  
steps*  
for  
yourself  <<ARGM-GOL
and  
whenever  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
need*  >ARGM-TMP
money  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
use*  
it  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
again  
.  

PLEASE  >ARGM-DIS
REMEMBER*  
that  
this  
program  >>ARG0
remains*  
successful*  
because  
of  
the  
honesty  <ARGM-CAU
and  
integrity  
of  
the  
participants  
and  
by  
their  >ARG0
carefully  >ARGM-MNR
adhering*  
to  
directions*  
.  

Look*  
at  
it  <ARG1
this  
way  <ARGM-MNR
.  

If  
you  >ARG1
were*  
of  
integrity  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
program  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
continue*  
and  
the  
money  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG1
so  
many  
others  >>ARG0
have*  
received*  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
come*  >ARGM-LVB
your  >ARG1
way*  
.  

NOTE  
:  
You  >>ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
want*  
to  
retain*  
every  
name  >ARG1
and  
address  
sent*  
to  
you  <ARG2
,  
either  
on  
a  
computer  <<ARGM-LOC
or  
hard  >ARGM-MNR
copy*  
and  
keep*  
the  
notes  >ARG1
people  >ARG0
send*  
you  <ARG2
.  

This  >ARG0
VERIFIES*  
that  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
truly  >ARGM-ADV
providing*  
a  
service*  
.  

(  
Also  >ARGM-DIS
,  
it  
might  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
good  
idea  <ARG2
to  
wrap*  
the  
$  
1  
bill  <ARG1
in  
dark  
paper  <ARG2
to  
reduce*  
the  
risk*  
of  
mail  
theft  <ARG1
)  
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
as  
each  
post*  >>ARG1
is*  
downloaded*  >>ARGM-ADV
and  
the  
directions*  >ARG1
carefully  >ARGM-MNR
followed*  
,  
all  
members  >>ARG2
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
reimbursed*  
for  
their  >ARG0
participation*  
as  
a  
List  
Developer  <ARGM-PRD
with  
one  
dollar  <<ARG1
each  
.  

Your  
name  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
move*  
up  
the  
list  <ARG2
geometrically  <ARGM-MNR
so  
that  
when  >ARGM-TMP
your  
name  >ARG0
reaches*  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
#  
1  
position  <ARG1
you  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
receiving*  
thousands  <ARG1
of  
dollars  
in  
CASH  
!!!  

What  
an  
opportunity  
for  
only  
$  
6.00  
(  
$  
1.00  
for  
each  
of  
the  
first  
six  
people  >ARG1
listed*  
above  <ARGM-LOC
)  

Send*  
it  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
add*  
your  
own  
name  <ARG1
to  
the  
list  <ARG2
and  
you  >ARG1
're*  
in  
business  <ARG2

*****  
DIRECTIONS*  
FOR  
HOW  >ARGM-MNR
TO

*****  

STEP  
ONE  
:  
You  >>ARG0

this

your  >ARG0

Simply  >>ARGM-ADV

and  
drag*

and  
select*

STEP  
TWO

that

STEP

Save*

Ever  
since  
he  >>ARG0
ate*  >>ARGM-TMP
up  
Red  
Riding  
Hood  
's  
grandma  <ARG1
and  
blew*  
down  <ARGM-DIR
the  
houses  <ARG1
of  
two  
-  
thirds  
of  
the  
Three  
Little  
Pigs  
,  
the  
Big  
Bad  
Wolf  >>ARG0
has*  
held*  
a  
persistently  
bad  
reputation  <ARG1
.  

In  
part  
because  
of  
that  
reputation  >>ARGM-CAU
,  
the  
gray  
wolf  >>ARG1
was*  
nearly  >ARGM-ADV
exterminated*  
from  
the  
lower  
48  
states  <ARGM-LOC
by  
the  
1920s  <ARGM-TMP
,  
except  
for  
a  
small  >ARGM-ADJ
remnant  >ARGM-ADJ
population*  
on  
Isle  
Royale  
National  
Park  <ARG1
in  
Michigan  
's  
Lake  
Superior  
.  

The  
last  
wolf  >>ARG1
was*  
killed*  
in  
Yellowstone  
National  
Park  <ARGM-LOC
in  
1943  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Western  
sheep  
and  
cattle  
ranchers  >>ARG0
,  
on  
whose  
behalf  >>R-ARGM-GOL
this  
extermination  >ARG1
campaign*  >>ARG1
was*  
conducted*  
,  
gratefully  >>ARGM-ADV
dusted*  
their  
hands  <ARG1
of  
the  
wolf  <ARGM-PRD
and  
wrote*  
him  <ARG1
off  <C-V
as  
a  
job  >ARG1
well  >ARGM-MNR
done*  
.  

Their  
sheep  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
graze*  
,  
their  
cows  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
ruminate*  
and  
never  >>ARGM-NEG
a  
discouraging  
word  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
heard*  
.  

After  
the  
major  >ARGM-ADJ
kill*  
-  
offs  >ARGM-TMP
,  
wolves  >ARG1
outside  
of  
Alaska  
and  
Canada  
existed*  
mostly  
as  
legend  <ARG2
.  

Like  
UFOs  >ARGM-ADV
or  
Sasquatch  
,  
several  
people  >>ARG0
claimed*  
to  
see*  
fleeting  
lone  
wolves  <ARG1
,  
usually  
in  
Yellowstone  <ARGM-LOC
.  

In  
the  
1960s  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
a  
group  >>ARG0
shooting*  
a  
movie  <ARG2
in  
the  
Wyoming  
park  <ARGM-LOC
reportedly  >>ARGM-ADV
imported*  
some  
captive  
wolves  <ARG1
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
released*  
them  <ARG1
when  >>ARGM-TMP
their  >ARG0
shooting*  >>ARG1
was*  
done*  
.  

If  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
this  
happy  
band  >>ARG2
has*  
not  >>ARGM-NEG
been*  
heard*  
from  <C-ARG2
since  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Rumor*  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
had*  
it  <ARG1
some  
renegade  
biologist  >>ARG0
brought*  
a  
caged*  
pair  <ARG1
to  
Yellowstone  <<ARG2
and  
released*  
them  <ARG1
into  
the  
wild  <ARGM-DIR
sometime  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
1970s  
,  
hoping*  
to  
reestablish*  
a  
breeding  >ARGM-PRD
population*  
.  

If  
true  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
caper  >ARG2
failed*  
.  

Over  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
wolf  >ARG1
's  
absence*  >>ARG0
seemed*  
to  
rehabilitate*  
its  
image  <ARG1
.  

Eventually  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
a  
trickle  >>ARG1
of  
support*  
appeared*  
for  
bringing*  
the  
predator  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
to  
its  
former  
home  
range  
in  
the  
northern  
Rocky  
Mountains  
.  

This  
trickle  >ARG1
grew*  
into  
a  
flood*  
,  
resulting*  
in  
14  
wolves  >>ARG1
being*  
reintroduced*  
in  
Yellowstone  <ARG2
in  
1995  <ARGM-TMP
by  
the  
U.S.  
Fish  
and  
Wildlife  
Service  <ARG0
--  
albeit  
over  
the  
strong  >ARGM-ADJ
and  
still  
-  
continuing  
objections*  
of  
ranchers  <ARG0
.  

These  
wolf  
packs  >>ARG1
have*  
flourished*  
,  
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
there  
are*  
an  
estimated  
850  
wolves  >ARG0
roaming*  
the  
northern  
Rockies  >ARGM-LOC
,  
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
merely  
10  
years  
ago  >ARGM-TMP
there  
were*  
none  <ARG1
.  

One  
compelling  >ARGM-ADJ
argument*  >>ARG1
for  
reintroduction*  
was*  
the  
wolf  >ARG0
acts*  
as  
a  
keystone  
predator  <ARG1
,  
an  
animal  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
affects*  
the  
populations*  
,  
behavior  
and  
ecology  
of  
a  
wide  
variety  <ARG2
of  
species  
within  
its  
range  
.  

Some  
recent  >ARGM-TMP
research*  >>ARG0
conducted*  
by  
Oregon  
State  
University  <ARG0
has*  
given*  
considerable  
credence  <ARG1
to  
this  
idea  <ARG2
.  

OSU  
forestry  
professors  
William  >>ARG0
Ripple  
and  
Robert  
Beschta  
have*  
found*  
that  
wolves  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
promote*  
stream  
-  
bank  >ARG1
stabilization*  
,  
although  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
given*  
the  
phenomenon  <ARG2
the  
unfortunate  
name  <ARG1
of  
"  
the  
ecology  
of  
fear*  
"  
--  
something  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
smacks*  
of  
the  
horrible  
PR  >ARG2
resulting*  
from  
the  
wolf  >ARG0
's  
relationships*  
with  
Riding  
Hood  <ARG2
and  
the  
Three  
Pigs  
.  

They  >ARG0
explained*  
that  
elk  >>ARG0
in  
Yellowstone  
used*  
to  
browse*  
unmolested  <ARGM-PRD
on  
young  
aspen  >ARG1
and  
willow  
growing*  
near  
the  
banks  <ARGM-LOC
of  
streams*  
,  
a  
behavior  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
prevented*  
the  
saplings  >ARG0
from  
reaching*  
mature  
stages  <ARG1
and  
increased*  
the  
possibility  <ARG1
of  
soil  >ARG1
erosion*  
.  

Since  
reintroduction*  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
however  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
Ripple  >>ARG0
and  
Beschta  
have*  
found*  
,  
fear*  >>ARG0
of  
the  
wolves  <ARG1
apparently  >>ARGM-ADV
has*  
discouraged*  
the  
elk  >>ARG0
from  
spending*  
too  
much  
time  <ARG1
at  
stream  
banks  >ARGM-LOC
--  
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
they  >ARG1
are*  
out  <ARG2
in  
the  
open  
--  
and  
munching*  
on  
the  
saplings  <ARG1
.  

"  
All  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
do*  
is*  >>ARG1
look*  
at  
the  
photographs  <ARG1
,

Ed  >>ARG0
Bangs  
,  
wolf  >ARG1
recovery*  
coordinator  
for  
the  
U.S.  
Fish  
and  
Wildlife  
Service  
,  
told*  
UPI

Blue

"  
You  >ARG0
say*  
,  
'  
wow  <ARG1
!  
'  

An  
area  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
used*  
to  
be*  
bald  <ARG2
as  
a  
billiard  
ball  
is*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
a  
sea  <ARG2
of  
willow  
.  
"  

This  
simple  >ARGM-ADJ
change*  >>ARG0
has*  
triggered*  
a  
veritable  
ecological  
cascade  <ARG1
in  
Yellowstone  <ARGM-LOC
.  

More  
streamside  
willow  >>ARG1
and  
aspen  
have*  
meant*  
better  
habitat  <ARG2
for  
beaver  
,  
for  
instance  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Where  >>ARGM-LOC
there  
had*  
been*  >>ARGM-LOC
only  
one  
beaver  
colony  <ARG1
in  
the  
park  
's  
northern  
range  <ARGM-LOC
before  
the  
wolves  >ARG1
returned*  
,  
now  >ARGM-TMP
there  
are*  
nine  <ARG1
.  

"  
It  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
uninteresting  >ARG1
to  
a  
lot  
of  
people  
,  
"  
Beschta  >ARG0
told*  
Blue

"  
There  
's*  
a

But  
we  >>ARG0

Since

The

provide*  
shade  <ARG1
and  
root

for  
bank  
stability  <ARGM-PRP
.  

Plants  >ARG1
are*  
critical  <ARG2
to  
wildland

"  

Yellowstone  >ARG0
has*  
a  
vast  
elk  
herd  <ARG1
,  
one  
of  
the  
largest  
in  
the  
world  
.  

Bangs  >ARG0
said*  
although  
the  
number  >>ARG1

has*  
not  >ARGM-NEG

very  
much  <ARG2

markedly  >ARGM-EXT

"

however  <<ARGM-ADV

Wolf  >ARG1
reintroduction*  >>ARG0
in  
the  
northern  
Rockies  <ARG2
has*  
been*  
so  >ARGM-CXN
successful*  
the  
Fish  
and  
Wildlife  
Service  >>ARG0

moved*  
to  
reduce*  
the  
animal

threatened  <ARG4

,  
eventually  >ARGM-TMP

to  
remove*  
it  <ARG1

the

list  <ARG2
altogether  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Bangs  >ARG0
said*  
the

established*  
viable  
wolf  
packs  <ARG1
in  
the  
northern  
Rockies  <ARGM-LOC
,  
as  
required*  
by  
federal  >ARG0
regulations*  
.  

Some  
conservationists  >ARG0
want*  
the  
protection*  >ARG1
extended*  
so  
wolves  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
move*  
into  
other  
states  <ARG2
,  
including  
Colorado  
,  
Utah  
and  
Oregon  
,  
among  
others  
.  

On  
Jan.  >ARGM-TMP
31  
,  
Oregon  
Federal  
District  
Court  
Judge  >>ARG0
Robert  
E.  
Jones  
appeared*  
to  
agree*  
with  
them  <ARG2

He  >ARG0
vacated*  
the  
FWS  >ARG0
decision*  
to  
downgrade*  
the  
wolf  
's  
status  <ARG1
.  

Bangs  >ARG0
said*  
his  
agency  >>ARG0
is*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
reviewing*  
the  
decision*  
.  

Regardless  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
wolf  
's  
legal  
status  
,  
its  >ARG1
future  >ARGM-TMP
expansion*  >>ARG1
into  
new  
areas  <ARG4
now  >ARGM-TMP
seems*  
likely*  
.  

Wolves  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
migrate*  
considerable  
distances  <ARGM-EXT
.  

A  
Yellowstone  
wolf  >>ARG1
was*  
found*  
dead  <ARG1
,  
hit*  
by  
a  
car  <ARG2
,  
on  
a  
Colorado  
highway  <<ARGM-LOC
last  
year  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
several  
hundred  
miles  
from  
home  <<ARGM-LOC

Meanwhile  >ARGM-TMP
,  
his  
reputation  >>ARG1
seems*  
to  
be*  
improving*  
,  
although  
Bangs  >ARG0
noted*  
a  
"  
pretty  
interesting  
social  
dynamic  <ARG1
.  
"  

There  
are*  
only  
about  
850  
wolves  <ARG1
in  
the  
West  <ARGM-LOC
,  
but  
there  
are*  
an  
estimated  
31,000  
mountain  
lions  <ARG1
.  

Pound  >ARGM-ADV
for  
pound  
,  
mountain  
lions  >ARG0
eat*  
more  
game  <ARG1
and  
more  
livestock  
than  
wolves  
.  

They  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
occasionally  >ARGM-TMP
attack*  
people  <ARG1
,  
which  
wolves  
do*  
not  
--  
despite  
the  
propaganda  <<ARGM-ADV
from  
the  
Brothers  
Grimm  
.  

Yet  >ARGM-DIS
people  >>ARG0
seem*  
willing*  
--  
even  >ARGM-ADV
eager*  
--  
to  
accommodate*  
mountain  
lions  <ARG1
,  
despite  
the  
risks*  
.  

It  >>ARG1
remains*  
to  
be*  
seen*  
whether  
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
extend*  
the  
same  
courtesy  <ARG1
to  
the  
arriving  
gray  
wolf  <ARG2
.  

Regarding  
those  
rumors*  
about  
wolves  >ARG0
living*  
in  
Yellowstone  <ARGM-LOC
prior  
to  
the  
official  >ARGM-ADJ
reintroduction*  
?  

They  >>ARG1
seem*  
to  
be*  
just  
that  <ARG2
:  
rumors*  
.  

True  
,  
there  
are*  
about  
300,000  
wolves  >ARG1

wolf  
hybrids  
kept*  
as  
pets  <ARGM-PRD
in  
the  
United

It  
also  >>ARGM-DIS

caught*  
someone  <ARG1

one  
extinction  
event  >>ARG1

As  
the

"

When

lived*

is*

lot  <ARG1

The

,  
when  >>ARGM-TMP

began*  >>ARGM-TMP
traveling*  
for  
business  <ARGM-PRP

New

I  >>ARG1

I  >>ARG0

when  >>ARGM-TMP

that  
many  >ARG1
of  
the  
displaced

(  
those  
affluent

those  
not  
)  
will  >ARGM-MOD

1.25

been*  
housed*

Sure  >ARGM-DIS

some  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
return*  
,  
but  
I  >>ARG0
have*  >ARGM-LVB

that  
once  
many  >>ARG0
begin*  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
get*  
jobs  <ARG1

temporary  >ARGM-ADJ

,  
they  >>ARG0

shy*  
about

Okay  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
new*  
to  
this  
forum  <ARG2
and  
really  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like*  
Bush  <ARG1
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
my  
view  
point  >ARG1
is*  
slanted  <ARG2
and  
I  >ARG0
admit*  
that  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
rarely  >ARGM-ADV
listen*  
to  
the  
news  <ARG1
or  
to  
what  >ARG1
politicians  >ARG0
or  
lawyers  
say*  
because  
so  
many  >ARG0
tell*  
lies*  
that  
none  >ARG0
have*  
credibility  <ARG1
so  
what  >ARG2
's*  
the  
point  <ARG1
?  

What  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
know*  
is*  
that  
I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
close  
friend  <ARG1
who's  
aunt  >ARG1
disappeared*  
in  
New  
Orleans  <ARGM-LOC
.  

My  
friend  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
computer  
capability  <ARG1
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
spent*  
the  
day  <ARG1
searching*  
and  
posting*  
online  <ARG2
.  

The  
family  >>ARG0
here  
(  
California  
)  
wanted*  
to  
fly*  
any  
family  
members  <ARG1
from  
there  
to  
CA  <ARGM-DIR
,  
so  
they  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
remain*  
here  <ARG3
until  
things  >>ARG1
got*  
straightened*  
out  
down  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
cousins  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
found*  
because  
no  
one  >>ARG0
was*  
sure*  
of  
their  
married  
names  <ARG1
.  

The  
hope*  >ARG1
was*  
that  
anyone  >>ARG0
looking*  
for  
the  
Aunt  <ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
see*  
the  
family  >ARG0
post*  
and  
know*  
that  
help*  >>ARG2
was*  
available*  
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
Oct.  <ARG2
6  
,  
and  
not  
one  
family  
member  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
located*  
.  

What  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
saw*  
was*  
dozens  <ARG2
of  
school  
buses  >>ARG1
submerged*  
that  >>R-ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
used*  
to  
evacuate*  
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
had*  >ARGM-LVB
no  >ARGM-NEG
transportation*  
.  

What  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
heard*  
was*  
the  
Mayor  >ARG0
of  
New  
Orleans  
,  
saying*  
that  
he  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
order*  
the  
buses  >>ARG1
or  
anything  
else  
to  
be*  
used*  
because  
he  >>ARG1
was*  
waiting*  
on  
someone  <ARG2
else  
to  
tell*  
him  <ARG2
what  >ARG1
to  
do*  
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
common  >ARGM-ADJ
sense*  >ARG0
takes*  
a  
back  
seat  <ARG1
to  
politics  
and  
legal  
mumbo  
jumbo  
what  >>ARG2
have*  
we  >ARG1
become*  
?  

Recently  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Bush  >ARG0
addressed*  
the  
nation  <ARG2
.  

About  
30  
seconds  >>ARGM-TMP
into  
his  >ARG0
address*  
,  
he  >>ARG0
started*  
flogging*  
the  
terrorist  >ARG0
issue*  
just  
one  
more  
time  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

Ironically  >ARGM-ADV
he  >>ARG0
almost  >ARGM-ADV
burst*  
out  
laughing*  
and  
it  
was*  
all  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
to  
keep*  
his  
mirth  <ARG1
down  <ARG2
to  
a  
barely  
controlled  
smirk  
.  

Even  
he  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
believe*  
that  
he  >>ARG0
is*  
trotting*  
out  
this  
old  
saw  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
guess*  
if  
you  >ARG0
have*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
schtick  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
is*  
a  
resounding  >ARGM-EXT
success*  
once  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
you  >>ARG0
ca  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
help*  
but  
trot*  
it  <ARG1
out  <C-V
every  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
your  
act  >>ARG1
is*  
going*  
sour  <ARG2
.  

Meanwhile  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
every  
pocket  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
lined*  
is*  
golden  <ARG2
and  
the  
poor  >>ARG1
are*  
shunted*  
off  
radar  <ARG2
yet  
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
gall  >ARG1
of  
it  
all  
is*  
that  
Bush  >>ARG0
is*  
stumping*  
for  
more  
money  <ARG1
to  
build*  
more  
refineries  <ARG1
,  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
what  >>ARG1
he  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
is*  
pour*  
money  <ARG1
into  
making*  
the  
US  >ARG0
independent*  
of  
OPEC  <ARG1
or  
crude  
oil  
all  
together  <ARGM-EXT
.  

We  >ARG0
have*  
the  
technology  <ARG1
;  
if  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
going*  
to  
spend*  
billions  <ARG3
of  
dollars  
touting*  
"  
FREEDOM  <ARG1
"  
why  >ARGM-CAU
not  >ARGM-NEG
spend*  
those  
billions  <ARG3
making*  
all  >ARG1
of  
us  
free*  
?  

Free  
of  
polution*  
,  
free  
of  
oil  
dependency  
,  
and  
free  
of  
big  
business  >>ARG0

bleeding*  
us  <ARG1
dry  <ARGM-PRD
for  
the  
short  
term

I  >>ARG1
'm*  
sorry*  
he  >ARG0

me  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
puke*  
so  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
shut*  
him  <ARG1
off  <C-V

In  
the  
meanwhile  >ARGM-TMP
there  
are*

broken

He  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
little  <ARG1
during  
the  
day  <ARGM-TMP
,  
for  >>ARGM-DIS
Murillo  >>ARG0
took*  
every  >ARGM-EXT
precaution*  
and  
never  >ARGM-TMP
went*  
out  
save  
with

Lucas  
,  
or  
Lopez  
as  
he  >>ARG1
was*  
known*  
in  
the  
days  <ARGM-TMP
of  
his  
greatness  
.  

At  
night  >ARGM-TMP
,  
however  >ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >ARG0
slept*  
alone  <ARGM-PRD
,  
and  
the  
avenger  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
find*  
him  <ARG1
.  

On  
a  
certain  
evening  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
had*  
been*  
prearranged*  
,  
I  >ARG0
sent*  
my  
friend  <ARG2
final  >ARGM-ADJ
instructions*  
,  
for  
the  
man  >>ARG0
was*  
forever  <ARGM-TMP
on  
the  
alert*  
and  
continually  >ARGM-TMP
changed*  
his  
room  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
to  
see*  
that  
the  
doors  >>ARG1
were*  
open*  
and  
the  
signal*  >>ARG0
of  
a  
green  
or  
white  
light  <ARG0
in  
a  
window  >ARG0
which  >R-ARG0
faced*  
the  
drive  <ARG1
was*  
to  
give*  >ARGM-LVB
notice*  
if  
all  >>ARG0
was*  
safe*  
or  
if  
the  
attempt*  >>ARG1
had*  
better  
be*  
postponed*  
.  

"  
But  >>ARGM-DIS
everything  >>ARG2
went*  
wrong*  
with  
us  <ARGM-GOL
.  

In  
some  
way*  >>ARGM-MNR
I  >>ARG0
had*  
excited*  
the  
suspicion*  
of  
Lopez  <ARG0
,  
the  
secretary  
.  

He  >>ARG1
crept*  
up  
behind  
me  <ARGM-DIR
and  
sprang*  
upon  
me  <ARG3
just  
as  
I  >>ARG0
had*  
finished*  
the  
note  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
and  
his  
master  
dragged*  
me  <ARG1
to  
my  
room  <ARG2
and  
held*  
judgment*  
upon  
me  <ARG1
as  
a  
convicted  
traitress  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

Then  >>ARGM-ADV
and  
there  
they  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
plunged*  
their  
knives  <ARG1
into  
me  <ARG2
could  >>ARGM-MOD
they  >>ARG0
have*  
seen*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
escape*  
the  
consequences  <ARG1
of  
the  
deed  
.  

Finally  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
after  
much  >ARGM-EXT
debate*  >ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >ARG0
concluded*  
that  
my  >ARG1
murder*  >>ARG0
was*  
too  >ARGM-EXT
dangerous*  
.  

But  
they  >>ARG0
determined*  
to  
get*  >ARGM-LVB
rid*  
forever  <ARGM-TMP
of  
Garcia  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
had*  
gagged*  
me  <ARG1
,  
and  
Murillo  >ARG0
twisted*  
my  
arm  <ARG1
round  <ARGM-DIR
until  
I  >ARG0
gave*  
him  <ARG2
the  
address  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
swear*  
that  
he  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
twisted*  
it  <ARG1
off  <ARGM-DIR
had  
I  >ARG0
understood*  
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
mean*  
to  
Garcia  <ARG3
.  

Lopez  >>ARG0
addressed*  
the  
note  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
had*  
written*  
,  
sealed*  
it  <ARG1
with  
his  
sleeve  
-  
link  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
sent*  
it  <ARG1
by  
the  
hand  <ARGM-MNR
of  
the  
servant  
,  
Jose  
.  

How  >ARGM-MNR
they  >ARG0
murdered*  >>ARG1
him  <ARG1
I  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
,  
save  
that  
it  
was*  
Murillo  
's  
hand  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
struck*  
him  <ARG1
down  <C-V
,  
for  
Lopez  >>ARG0
had*  
remained*  
to  
guard*  
me  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
believe*  
he  >>ARG0
must  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
waited*  
among  
the  
gorse  
bushes  >ARG2
through  
which  >R-ARG2
the  
path  >ARG1
winds*  
and  
struck*  
him  <ARG1
down  <C-V
as  
he  >ARG1
passed*  
.  

At  
first  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG1
were*  
of  
a  
mind  <ARG2
to  
let*  
him  >ARG0
enter*  
the  
house  <ARG1
and  
to  
kill*  
him  <ARG1
as  
a  
detected  
burglar  <ARGM-PRD
;  
but  
they  >ARG0
argued*  
that  
if  
they  >>ARG1
were*  
mixed*  >>ARGM-ADV
up  
in  
an  
inquiry*  
their  
own  
identity  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
at  
once  >>ARGM-TMP
be*  
publicly  >ARGM-MNR
disclosed*  
and  
they  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
open*  
to  
further  >ARGM-ADJ
attacks*  
.  

With  
the  
death*  >>ARG2
of  
Garcia  <ARG1
,  
the  
pursuit*  >ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
cease*  
,  
since  
such  
a  
death*  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
frighten*  
others  <ARG1
from  
the  
task*  
.

The

Came*  
the

seven  
times  <ARGM-ADV

well  
as

the  
holy

Holy  
Cabalah  
tradition

After  
George  >ARG0
Harrison  
,  
said*  >>ARGM-TMP
arrogantly  <ARGM-MNR
in  
a  
video  >ARG1
filmed*  
in  
his  
studio  <ARGM-LOC
at  
Henley  
on  
Thames  
:  
"  
I  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
talk*  
about  
the  
divinity  <ARG1
of

"  
,  
he  >>ARG2
was*  
given*  
throat  
cancer  >>ARG0
by  
GOD  <ARG0
because  
of  
those  
words  <ARGM-CAU

which  >>R-ARG0
made*  
metastasis  <ARG1
and  
carried*  
on  
to  
final  >ARGM-ADJ
death*  
..  

To  
Paul  >>ARGM-ADV
McCartney  
whose  
company  
's  
logo  >R-ARG1
was*  
a  
person  >ARG0
toying*  
with  
the  
planets  <ARG1
as  
if  
he  >ARG1
was*  
a  
god  <ARG2
,  
and  
who  >>R-ARG1
was*  
being*  
very  
much  >ARGM-EXT
deluded*  
in  
his  >ARG0
ego  >ARG0
trip*  
by  
the  
fact  <<ARG0
that  
he  >>ARG1
was*  
made*  
"  
Sir  <C-ARG1
"  
(  
when  
in  
England  >>ARGM-LOC
even  
the  
road  
sweeper  >>ARG1

made*  
Sir  <C-ARG1
,  
as  
long  <ARGM-ADV
as  
he  >ARG0

money  <ARG1
for  
the  
nation  <ARG3
)  
,  
GOD  >ARG0
provided*  
cancer  <ARG1
to  
the  
wife  <ARG2
.  

The  
advertising  
farce  >>ARG1
of  
how  
much  >ARGM-EXT
he  >ARG0
loved*  
Linda  <ARG1
(  
woman  >>ARG1
whose  
quality  >>R-ARG1
he  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
deserve*  
)  
,  
was*  
exposed*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
it  
was*  
known*  
that  
Paul  >>ARG0
had*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
affair*  
with  
Heather  >>ARG4
Mills  
,  
Linda  
's  
intimate  
friend  
,  
with  
whom  >R-ARGM-COM
McCartney  >ARG0
went*  
on  
a  
trip*  
to  
New  
York  <ARG1
and  
to  
whom  >R-ARG4
he  >ARG0
bought*  
things  <ARG1
and  
presents  
,  
while  
he  >>ARG0
was*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
mourning*  
for  
his  
"  
dear  
Linda  <ARG1
"  
.  

At  
the  
same  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
McCartney  >>ARG0
was*  
going*  
out  
with  
Heather  <ARG1
Mills  
,  
he  >ARG0
used*  
Linda  >ARG1
's  
death*  
for  
promotional  
ends  <<ARG2
,  
due  
to  
his  
waning*  
popularity  <ARG1
.  

Paul  >>ARG0
was*  
going*  
out  
with  
Heather  <ARG1
,  
but  
in  
front  >ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
audience  
he  >>ARG0
played*  
the  
faithful  
husband  
's  
masquerade  <ARG1
pretending*  
to  
suffer*  
for  
Linda  <ARG1
,  
for  
the  
afore  
mentioned  
promotional  
ends  <<ARGM-PRP
.  

Paul  >ARG0
admitted*  
that  
he  >ARG0
made*  
Linda  >ARG0
suffer*  
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT
,  
but  
he  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
say*  
that  
it  >ARG1
was*  
because  
he  >>ARG1
felt*  
insecure*  
as  
a  
man  <ARG2
due  
to  
his  
womanish  
face  <ARGM-CAU
and  
effeminate  
manners  
and  
also  
because  
with  
his  
age  >>ARGM-ADV
his  
sexual  
power  >>ARG1
was*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
the  
same*  
,  
even  
though  
it  >>ARG1
has*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
been*  
much  <ARG2
.  

The  
early  
days  >ARG1
were*  
the  
days  <ARG2
of  
competition*  
between  
Paul  <ARG0
and  
his  
wife  
and  
John  
and  
his  
wife  
and  
he  >ARG0
knew*  
he  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
compete*  
with  
ugly  
John  <ARG1
for  
the  
leadership*  
of  
the  
band  <ARG1
in  
front  <<ARGM-LOC
of  
their  
wives  
and  
having*  >ARG0
Yoko  <ARG1
Ono  
made*  
him  >ARG0
aware*  
of  
his  
lack*  
of  
virility  <ARG1
and  
repressed  
homosexuality  
,  
he  >>ARG0
grew*  
the  
beard  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
we  >ARG0
see*  
in  
the  
"  
Let*  
it  >ARG1
Be*  
"  
film  <<ARGM-LOC
and  
started*  
to  
show*  
pictures  <ARG1
of  
naked  
women  
in  
the  
same  
film  <ARGM-LOC
,  
doing*  >ARGM-LVB
every  
effort*  
he  
could  <ARG0
to  
be*  
seen*  
as  
a  
man  <ARG2
....  

It  
is*  
easy*  
to  
note*  
the  
uneasiness  >ARGM-TMP
of  
McCartney  
when  >R-ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
sings*  
:  
"  
I  >>ARG0
've*  
got*  >>ARGM-LVB
a  
feeling*  
,  
a  
feeling*  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hide*  
...  
"  
in  
front  <<ARGM-LOC
of  
Yoko  
in  
the  
film  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

(  
He  >>ARG1
already  >>ARGM-TMP
had*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
traumas*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
his  
previous  
girlfriend  >>ARG0
Jane  
Asher  
had*  
caused*  
him  <ARGM-GOL
when  >ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG0
made*  
him  >ARG0
aware*  
of  
his  
little  
manliness  <ARG1
and  
effeminate  
manners  
)  
.  

Paul  >ARG0
has*  
such  
a  
big  
inferiority  
complex  <ARG1
as  
a  
man  
,  
due  
to  
his  
effeminate  
face  
,  
body  
and  
personality  
and  
due  
to  
his  
repressed  
homosexuality  
,  
that  
he  >>ARG0
found*  
himself  <ARG2
a  
handicapped  
woman  <ARG1
with  
only  
one  
leg  
,  
so  
that  
he  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
stand*  
out  
,  
being*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
conscious*  
that  
a  
full  
woman  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
make*  
him  >ARG0
feel*  
the  
superiority  <ARG1
of  
virile  
men  
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
as  
Jane  
and  
Linda  
did*  
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
something  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
his  >ARG0
ego  >ARG0
trip*  >ARG0
of  
lucky  
bad  
musician  <ARGM-ADJ
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
face*  
anymore  <ARGM-TMP
....  

He  >>ARG0
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
conscious*  
that  
money  >ARGM-MNR
and  
fame  
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
buy*  
virility  <ARG1
and  
manliness  
.  

Besides  
being*  
a  
murderer  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
John  >>ARG0
Lennon  
had*  >ARGM-LVB
sexual  >ARGM-MNR
intercourse*  
with  
homosexual  
Brian  <ARG1
Epstein  
to  
get*  
him  >ARG1
interested*  
in  
going*  
to  
see*  
the  
band  <ARG1
at  
the  
Cavern  <ARGM-LOC
,  
trauma  >ARG2
from  
which  >R-ARG2
he  >ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
recovered*  
.  

Because  
of  
the  
trauma  >>ARGM-CAU
that  >>R-ARG1
his  >ARG0
homosexual  >ARG1
relation*  >>ARG0
with  
Brian  <ARG2
Epstein  
had*  
left*  
him  <ARG2
,  
he  >>ARG0
made*  
lyrics  <ARG1
such  
as  
:  
"  
You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
wear*  
a  
collar  <ARG1
and  
a  
tie  
,  
one  
thing  >>ARG1
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hide*  
is*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
're*  
crippled  <ARG2
inside  <ARGM-LOC
"  
and  
gave*  >ARGM-LVB
declarations*  
to  
the  
"  
Rolling  
Stone  
"  
magazine  <ARG2
saying*  
that  
"  
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
wore*  
Texan  
boots  <ARG1
to  
feel*  
more  
secure  <ARG1
as  
a  
man  
"  
.  

The  
Beatles  >>ARG1
are*  
very  
well  >ARGM-EXT
known*  
by  
people  <ARG0
close  
to  
them  
for  
their  
arrogance  <ARGM-PRP
and  
racism  
.  

One  >>ARG1
of  
the  
manifestations*  
of  
their  
racism  <ARG1
is*  
the  
rejection  <ARG2
towards  
Japanese  
Yoko  
Ono  
.  

That  
rejection  >ARG1
got*  
to  
the  
point  >ARGM-ADV
that  >R-ARGM-ADV
George  >ARG0
Harrison  
kicked*  
Yoko  <ARG1
Ono  
in  
the  
Apple  
studios  <ARGM-LOC
during  
the  
filming*  
of  
Let*  
it  >ARG1
Be*  
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
John  >ARG0
asked*  >>ARGM-TMP
George  <ARG2
while  
they  >>ARG0
were*  
having*  >ARGM-LVB
lunch*  
about  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
things  >>ARG1
were*  
going*  
for  
Paul  <ARGM-GOL
after  
his  >ARG1
separation*  
from  
the  
Beatles  <ARG2
and  
George  >ARG0
replied*  
that  
he  >ARG1
was*  
number  <ARG2
one  
in  
the  
Swedish  >ARGM-LOC
hit  >ARG0
parade*  
,  
John  >ARG0
said*  
in  
a  
despective  
manner  <ARGM-MNR
:  
"  
ah  <ARG1
!!  
..  
in  
Sweden  
..  
"  
,  
as  
if  
Sweden  >ARG1
was*  
an  
inferior  
place  <ARG2
or  
something  
alike  
.  

In  
the  
Beatles  
'  
song  >>ARGM-LOC
"  
Get*  
Back  <ARG2
"  
they  >ARG0
advise*  
black  
Joe  >ARG1
to  
"  
get*  
back  <ARG2
to  
where  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
once  >ARGM-TMP
belonged*  
"  
,  
as  
if  
England  >ARG1
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
place  <ARG2
for  
black  
people  
.  

Sometimes  
back  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Paul  >ARG0
told*  
George  <ARG2
in  
the  
Apple  
offices  <ARGM-LOC
that  
the  
new  
generations  >ARG1
are*  
a  
bundle  <ARG2
of  
idiots  
and  
useless  
people  
,  
but  
in  
any  
way  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
been*  
slaves  <ARG2
of  
the  
Beatles  
.  

The  
Jewish  >ARGM-ADJ
marriage*  >>ARG0
living*  
to  
the  
right  <ARGM-LOC
of  
George  
's  
house  
said*  
that  
he  >ARG1
is*  
an  
arrogant  
person  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
does*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
return*  
a  
greeting*  
.  

The  
newly  
married  
couple  >>ARG0
living*  
on  
the  
corner  <ARGM-LOC
in  
front  
of  
the  
entrance  
of  
George  
's  
house  
(  
Friar  
Park  
)  
refers*  
to  
him  <ARG1
as  
an  
overbearing  
person  <ARG2
to  
stay*  
away  <ARG3
from  
.  

The  
receptionist  >>ARG0
of  
"  
Hand  
made  
"  
,  
the  
former  
film  >ARG1
making*  
company  
of  
George  
Harrison  
said*  
:  
"  
we  
do*  
n't  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
any  
relation*  
with  
that  
man  <ARG2
anymore  
and  
we  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
know*  
anything  <ARG1
about  
him  
"  
.  

It  
is*  
interesting*  
to  
note*  
that  
this  
company  >>ARG1
was*  
made*  
bankrupt  <C-ARG1
by  
the  
British  
cinema  
industry  <ARG0
due  
to  
the  
despotism  <ARGM-CAU
and  
pedantry  
of  
George  >ARG0
Harrison  
,  
who  >R-ARG0
believed*  
that  
the  
cinema  
industry  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
worshiped*  
him  <ARG1
.  

Their  
chauvinisms  >ARG1
got*  
to  
the  
point  >ARGM-ADV
that  >R-ARGM-ADV
even  
they  >ARG0
themselves  
hated*  
each  
other  <ARG1
.  

Paul  >ARG0
McCartney  
said*  
that  
George  >ARG1
Harrison  
is*  
a  
nothing  <ARG2
.  

George  >ARG0
Harrison  
said*  
that  
he  >>ARG0
is*  
tired*  
of  
listening*  
to  
people  >ARG0
talk*  
about  
John  <ARG1
Lennon  
....  

George  >ARG0
Harrison  
said*  
in  
a  
video  <ARGM-LOC
that  
"  
Oasis  >ARG1
is*  
a  
very  
untalented  
band  <ARG2
and  
they  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
playing*  
at  
all  <ARGM-ADV
"  
,  
all  >ARG1
of  
it  
being*  
the  
truth  <ARG2
,  
but  
the  
Beatles  >ARG1
is*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
a  
band  <ARG2
of  
very  
poor  
musicians  >>ARG1
,  
if  
musicians  
at  
all  
,  
who  >R-ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
play*  
a  
couple  <ARG1
of  
elementary  
guitar  
chords  
and  
who  >R-ARG1
are*  
as  
untalented  <ARG2
as  
Oasis  
.  

The  
Beatles  >ARG1
of  
the  
times  
of  
the  
"  
Cavern  
"  
sounded*  
exactly  
as  
poorly  <ARG2
as  
Oasis  
and  
the  
little  
musical  
quality  >ARG1
in  
the  
songs  
of  
the  
Beatles  
is*  
due  
to  
George  <ARG2
Martin  
.  

Without  
George  >>ARGM-ADV
Martin  
the  
Beatles  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
just  
another  
untalented  
band  <ARG2
as  
Oasis  <ARGM-MNR
....  

Paul  >ARG0
McCartney  
said*  
recently  <ARGM-TMP
that  
he  >ARG0
believes*  
in  
using*  
magic  <ARG1
,  
and  
he  >>ARG0
does*  
lots  <ARG1
of  
charity  
,  
thinking*  
that  
in  
this  
way  >ARGM-MNR
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
compensate*  
for  
the  
CURSE*  >>ARG0
OF  
GOD  <ARG0
that  >R-ARG1
is*  
upon  
him  <ARG2
and  
that  >R-ARG0
took*  
his  
wife  
's  
life  <ARG1
because  
of  
his  
Satanism  <ARGM-CAU
and  
involvement*  
in  
black  
magic  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
thinks*  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
deceive*  
people  <ARG1
in  
this  
way  <ARGM-MNR
,  
so  
that  
the  
real  
McCartney  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
perceived*  
.  

Is*  
the  
old  
Devil  >>ARG0
attempting*  
to  
disguise*  
as  
good  <ARG2
in  
front  <ARGM-LOC
of  
people

Satan  >ARG0
deceiving*  
mankind  <ARG1
once  
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
as  
so  
many  
other  
thousands  <ARGM-ADV
of  
times  
through  
the  
centuries  
....  

After  
the  
Devil  >ARG0
began*  >ARGM-TMP
his  
devastating  
job  <ARG1
from  
the  
ghostly  
"  
Devil

through  
his  
nine  
main  
puppets  <ARG2
(

Rolling

,  
he  >ARG0
possessed*  
an  
endless  
amount  <ARG1
of  
other  
schizophrenic  
bad

in  
the  
afore  
mentioned

and  
weakening*  >ARGM-ADV
their  
conscience  <ARG1
with  
drugs  <ARGM-MNR
,  
he  >ARG0
made*  
them  <ARG1
proclaimers  <ARG1
of

An  
examination*  >>ARG1
of  
the  
ramifications*  
of  
such  
an  
attack*  
is*  
desperately  <ARGM-MNR
in  
order*  
.  

1  
.  
Blowback  
in  
Iraq  

The  
recent  >ARGM-TMP
elections*  >>ARG1
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
were*  
dominated*  
by  
an  
amalgam  <ARG0
of  
religiously  
fundamentalist  
Shi'ite  
organizations  
,  
principally  
the  
Dawa  
Party  
and  
the  
Supreme  
Council  
for  
Islamic  
Revolution  
in  
Iraq  
(  
SCIRI  
)  
.  

Both  
Dawa  >ARG0
and  
SCIRI  
have*  
umbilical  >ARG3
connections*  >>ARG1
to  
the  
fundamentalist  
Shi'ite  >ARGM-ADJ
leadership*  
in  
Iran  <ARGM-LOC
that  >R-ARG1
go*  
back  <ARGM-PRD
decades  <ARG4
.  

In  
essence  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Iran  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
owns*  
a  
significant  
portion  <ARG1
of  
the  
Iraqi  
government  
.  

Should  >ARGM-MOD
the  
United  
States  >ARG0
undertake*  >>ARGM-ADV
military  >ARG0
action*  
against  
Iran  <ARGM-GOL
,  
the  
ramifications*  >>ARG1
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
immediate  <ARG2
and  
extreme*  
.  

In  
the  
first  
eight  
days  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
January  
,  
eighteen  
US  
troops  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
killed*  
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
,  
compounded*  
by  
another  
twelve  
deaths*  
from  
a  
Black  
Hawk  
helicopter  >ARG1
crash*  
on  
Saturday  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Much  >>ARG1
of  
the  
violence  >ARG1
aimed*  
at  
American  
forces  <ARG2
is*  
coming*  
from  
disgruntled  
Sunni  
factions  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
have*  
their  
own  
militias  <ARG1
,  
believe*  
the  
last  >ARGM-TMP
elections*  >ARG1
were*  
a  
sham  <ARG2
,  
and  
hold*  
little  
political  
power  <ARG1
in  
the  
government  <ARGM-ADV
.  

If  
the  
US  >ARG0
attacks*  >ARGM-ADV
Iran  <ARG1
,  
it  
is*  
probable  <ARG2
that  
American  
forces  >>ARG0
-  
already  >ARGM-TMP
taxed*  
by  
attacks*  
from  
Sunni  
factions  <ARG0
-  
will  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-ADV
face*  
reprisal  >ARGM-CAU
attacks*  
in  
Iraq  <<ARGM-LOC
from  
Shi'ite  
factions  <ARG0
loyal  
to  
Iran  
.  

The  
result  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
dramatic  >ARGM-EXT
escalation*  
in  
US  
and  
civilian  
casualties  <ARG1
,  
US  
forces  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
required*  
to  
bunker*  
themselves  <ARG1
further  
into  
their  
bases  <ARG2
,  
and  
US  
forces  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
find*  
themselves  >>ARG0
required*  
to  
fight*  
the  
very  
government  >>ARG2
they  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
finished*  
helping*  
into  
power  <ARG1
.  

Iraq  >>ARG1
,  
already  
a  
seething*  
cauldron  <ARG1
,  
will  >ARGM-MOD
sink*  
further  <ARG2
into  
chaos  <ARG4
.

Iran

Armaments  

Unlike  
Iraq  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
Iran  >>ARG0
has*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
spent*  
the  
last  
fifteen  
years  <ARG1
having*  
its  
conventional  
forces  >ARG1
worn*  
down  
by  
grueling  
sanctions  <ARG0
,  
repeated  >ARGM-PRD

their  
armaments  >>ARG1

deteriorated*  
and  
the  
veterans  >>ARG0
of  
that  
last  >ARGM-TMP

have*  
retired*  
-  
the  
nation  >ARG0
enjoys*  
substantial  
military  
strength  <ARG1
nonetheless  <ARGM-ADV

According  
to  
a

A  
MILNET  
brief  >>ARG0
issued*  
in  
February  <ARGM-TMP

reports*  
,  
"  
Due  
to  
its  
position  >>ARGM-CAU
astride  
the  
Persian

,  
Iran  >>ARG1

constantly  >ARGM-TMP
been*  
a  
threat  <ARG2
to  
the

The

called  >ARGM-ADJ

Tanker

the  
late

all

to

The

cites*  
numerous  
areas  >>ARGM-LOC
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC

has*

the

aspect  
,  
anti-shipping  
cruise  
missiles

'  
"  

It  
is*  
Iran

missile

that  >R-ARG0
pose*  
the  
greatest  >ARGM-ADJ
concern*  
for  
American  
forces  <ARG1
in  
the  
Gulf  
,  
especially  
for  
the  
US  
Navy  
.  

Iran  
's  
coast  >>ARG1
facing*  
the  
Persian  
Gulf  <ARG1
is*  
a  
looming*  
wall  <ARG1
of  
mountains  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
look*  
down  
upon  
any  
naval  
forces  >ARG1
arrayed*  
in  
those  
waters  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
Gulf  >ARG0
itself  
only  >ARGM-ADV
has*  
one  
exit  <ARG1
,  
the  
Strait  >>ARG1
of  
Hormuz  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
dominated*  
by  
the  
mountainous  
Iranian  
coastline  <ARG0

In  
essence  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Iran  >ARG0
holds*  
the  
high  
ground  <ARG1
in  
the  
Gulf  <ARGM-LOC

Missile  
batteries  >>ARG0
arrayed*  
in

bloody  
havoc  <ARG1

Of  
all  
the  
missiles  
in  
Iran

armament  
,  
the  
most  
dangerous  >ARG1

the  
Russian  
-  
made  
SS  
-  
N  
-  
22  
Sunburn  <ARG2
.  

These  
missiles  >ARG1
are*  
,  
simply  <ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
fastest  
anti-ship  
weapons  <ARG2
on  
the  
planet

The  
Sunburn  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD

Mach  <ARG1
3  
at  
high  
altitude  <ARGM-LOC

Its  
maximum  
low  
-  
altitude  
speed  >ARG1
is*  
Mach  <ARG2
2.2  
,  
some  
three  
times  
faster  
than  
the  
American  
-  
made  
Harpoon  
.  

The  
Sunburn  >>ARG0
takes*  
two  
short  
minutes  <ARG1
to  
cover*  
its  
full  
range  <ARG1

The  
missile  
's  
manufacturers  >ARG0

that  
one

two  
missiles  >ARG0

five

The  
Sunburn  >>ARG1

superior*  
to

Recall*  
that  
it

.  

The  
USS

likewise  >ARGM-DIS
deployed*  
in  
the  
Gulf  <ARG2

The  
Sunburn  
missile  >>ARG0

with  
its  
incredible  
speed  >>ARGM-ADV
and  
ability  
to  
avoid*  
radar  >ARG0
detection*  
,  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
do*  >ARGM-LVB
terrible  >ARGM-ADJ
damage*  
these  
ships  <ARG1
if  
Iran  >>ARG0
chooses*  
to  
retaliate*  
in  
the  
Gulf  <ARGM-LOC
after  
an  
American  >ARG0
attack*  
within  
its  
borders  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Beyond  
the  
naval  
threat  >ARG2
is*  
the  
possibility  <ARG1
of  
Iran  >ARG0
throwing*  
its  
military  
muscle  <ARG1
into  
the  
ongoing  >ARGM-TMP
struggle*  
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Currently  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
US  >>ARG0
is*  
facing*  
an  
asymmetrical  >ARGM-ADJ
attack*  
from  
groups  >ARG0
wielding*  
small  
arms  <ARG1
,  
shoulder  
-  
fired  
grenades  
and  
roadside  
bombs  
.  

The  
vaunted  
American  
military  >>ARG0
has*  
suffered*  
2,210  
deaths*  
and  
tens  
of  
thousands  
of  
wounded  
from  
this  
form  <<ARGM-CAU
of  
warfare  
.  

The  
occupation*  >>ARG1
of  
Iraq  <ARG1
has*  
become*  
a  
guerrilla  >ARGM-MNR
war*  
,  
a  
siege  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
has*  
lasted*  
more  
than  
a  
thousand  
days  <ARG2
.  

If  
Iran  >>ARG0
decides*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
throw*  
any  <ARG1

all  
of  
its  
23,000  
armored

,  
along  
with  
any  
or  
all

its  
nearly  
million

,  
into  
the  
Iraq  
fray  <ARG2
,  
the  
situation  >ARG1

could  >ARGM-MOD

unspeakably  <ARG2
dire  <ARG2

.  
The  
Syrian  >ARG2
Connection*  

In  
February  >ARGM-TMP
of  
2005  
,  
Iran  >ARG0
and  
Syria  
agreed*  
upon  
a  
mutual  >ARGM-ADJ
protection*  
pact  >ARGM-ADV
to  
combat*  
"  
challenges*  
and  
threats  
"  
in  
the  
region  <ARGM-LOC
.  

This  >ARG1
was*  
a  
specific  >ARGM-ADJ
reaction*  
to  
the  
American  >ARG0
invasion*  
of  
Iraq  <ARG1
,  
and  
a  
reaction*  
to  
America  >ARG0
's  
condemnation*  
of  
Syria  <ARG1
after  
the  
death*  >>ARG1
of  
Lebanese  
Prime  
Minister  <ARG1
Rafik  
Hariri  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
was*  
widely  >ARGM-ADV
seen*  
as  
an  
assassination*  >ARG1
ordered*  
from  
Damascus  <ARG0
.  

An  
attack*  >>ARG0
on  
Iran  <ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
trigger*  
this  
mutual  >ARGM-ADJ
defense*  
pact  <<ARG1
,  
and  
could  >ARGM-MOD
conceivably  >ARGM-ADV
bring*  
Syria  <ARG1
into  
direct  >ARGM-ADJ
conflict*  
with  
American  
forces  <ARG1
.  

Like  
Iran  >ARGM-PRD
,  
Syria  
's  
military  >>ARG0
is*  
nothing  >ARG1
to  
scoff*  
at  <C-ARG1
.  

Virtually  >ARGM-ADJ
every  
credible  >ARGM-ADJ
analysis*  >ARG0
has*  
Syria  >ARG1
standing*  
as  
the  
strongest  
military  
force  <ARG2
in  
the  
Middle  
East  
after  
Israel  
.  

Damascus  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
intent  <ARG2
for  
years  <ARGM-TMP
upon  
establishing*  
significant  
military  
strength  >ARGM-ADV
to  
serve*  
as  
a  
counterweight  <ARG1
to  
Israel  
's  
overwhelming  
capabilities  
.  

As  
of  
2002  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Syria  >ARG0
had*  
some  
215,000  
soldiers  <ARG1
under  
arms  
,  
4,700  
tanks  
,  
and  
a  
massive  
artillery  
capability  
.  

The  
Syrian  
Air  
Force  >>ARG1
is*  
comprised*  
of  
ten  
to  
eleven  
fighter  
/  
attack*  
squadrons  >ARG1
and  
sixteen  
fighter  
squadrons  
,  
totaling*  
somewhere  
near  
650  
aircraft  <ARG2
.  

Syria  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
possesses*  
one  >ARG1
of  
the  
largest  
arsenals  
of  
ballistic  
missiles  
in  
the  
region  
,  
comprised*  
primarily  <ARGM-ADV
of  
SCUD  >ARG2
-  
derived*  
systems  <ARG1
.  

Iran  >>ARG1
,  
North  
Korea  
and  
China  
have*  
been*  
willing  
providers  <ARG2
of  
state  
-  
of  
-  
the  
-  
art  
technologies  
.  

Compounding*  
this  <ARG1
is*  
the  
well  >ARGM-ADJ
-  
based*  >ARGM-ADJ
suspicion*  
that  
Syria  >ARG0
has*  
perhaps  
the  
most  
advanced  
chemical  
weapons  
capability  <ARG1
in  
the  
Persian  
Gulf  
.

US

While  
the

if  
the  
US  >ARG0

,  
all  >ARG1
pale*  
in  
comparison*  
to  
the  
involvement*  
of  
China  <ARG1
in  
any  
US  
/  
Iran  >ARG0
engagement*  
.  

China  
's

their  
great  
thirst  <ARG0

petroleum  >ARG2

natural

their  
industry  <ARG1
.  

In  
the  
last  
several  
months  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
China  >>ARG0
has*  
inked*  
deals*  
with  
Iran  <ARG1
for  
$  
70  
billion  
dollars  
worth  <ARG3
of  
Iranian  
oil  
and  
natural  
gas  
.  

China  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
purchase*  
250  
million  
tons  <ARG1
of  
liquefied*  
natural  
gas  <ARG1
from  
Iran  <<ARG2
over  
the  
next  
30  
years  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
will  >ARGM-MOD
develop*  
the  
massive  
Yadavaran  
oil  
field  <ARG1
in  
Iran  
,  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
receive*  
150,000  
barrels  <ARG1
of  
oil  
per  
day  <ARGM-TMP
from  
that  
field  <ARG2
.  

China  >>ARG0
is*  
seeking*  
the  
construction*  
of  
a  
pipeline  <ARG1
from  
Iran  
to  
the  
Caspian  
Sea  >ARGM-LOC

where  >R-ARGM-LOC
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
link*  
with  
another  
planned  
pipeline  >ARG1
running*  
from  
Kazakhstan  <ARG3
to  
China  <ARG4
.  

Any  
US  >ARG0
attack*  >>ARG1
on  
Iran  <ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
perceived*  
by  
China  <ARG0
as  
a  
direct  
threat  <ARG2
to  
its  
economic  
health  
.  

Further  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
any  
fighting*  >ARG0
in  
the  
Persian  
Gulf  <ARGM-LOC
would  >ARGM-MOD
imperil*  
the

's  
liquefied*  
natural  
gas  <ARG1
through  
the  
Strait  <<ARGM-DIR

Should  >ARGM-MOD
China  >>ARG0
decide*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
retaliate*  
against  
the  
US  <ARG1
to  
defend*

oil  >ARG2
and  
natural  
gas  
deal*  
with  
Iran  <ARG1
,  
the  
US  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
faced*  
with  
a  
significant  
threat  <ARG1
.  

This  
threat  >ARG1
exists*  
not  
merely  
on  
a  
military  
level  <ARGM-LOC

the  
worst  
-  
case  
scenario  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
newly  >ARGM-TMP
-  
minted*  >ARGM-ADJ
American  >ARGM-ADJ
order*  >>ARG0
of  
battle*  
requiring*  
the  
use*  
of  
nuclear  
weapons  <ARG1
to  
rescue*  
a  
surrounded  
and  
imperiled*  
force  <ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
come*  
into  
play*  
,  
hurling*  
the  
entire  
planet  <ARG1
into  
military  
and  
diplomatic  
bedlam  <ARG2
.  

Conclusion*  
:  
Is*  
Any  >ARG1
of  
This  
Possible*  
?  

The  
question*  >>ARG1
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
put*  
as  
directly  <ARGM-MNR
as  
possible  
:  
what  
manner  >ARG0
of  
maniac  
would  >ARGM-MOD
undertake*  
a  
path  <ARG1
so  
fraught  
with  
peril  
and  
potential  
economic  
catastrophe  
?  

It  
is*  
difficult*  
to  
imagine*  
a  
justification*  
for  
any  
action*  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
envelop*  
the  
United  
States  <ARG1
in  
a  
military  >ARG2
and  
economic  
conflict*  
with  
Iraq  <ARG1
,  
Iran  
,  
Syria  
and  
China  
simultaneously  
.  

Iran  >>ARG2
is*  
suspected*  
by  
many  
nations  <ARG0
of  
working*  
towards  
the  
development*  
of  
nuclear  
weapons  <ARG1
,  
but  
even  
this  
justification*  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
tossed*  
into  
a  
cocked  
hat  <ARGM-DIR
.  

Recently  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
Russian  
president  
Vladimir  >>ARG0
Putin  
bluntly  >>ARGM-MNR
stated*  
that  
Iran  >>ARG0
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
developing*  
its  
nuclear  
capability  <ARG1
for  
any  
reasons  <ARGM-PRP
beyond  
peaceful  >ARGM-ADJ
energy  >ARG1
creation*  
,  
and  
pledged*  
to  
continue*  
assisting*  
Iran  <ARG1
in  
this  
endeavor*  
.  

Therefore  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
any  
attack*  >ARG0
upon  
Iran  
's  
nuclear  
facilities  <ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
bring*  
Russia  <ARG1
into  
the  
mess  <ARG2
.  

Iran  >>ARG1
also  >ARGM-DIS
stands*  
accused*  
of  
aiding*  
terrorism  <ARG1
across  
the  
globe  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
dangers  >>ARG0
implicit  
in  
any  
attack*  
upon  
that  
nation  <ARG1
,  
however  >ARGM-DIS
,  
seem*  
to  
significantly  >ARGM-EXT
offset*  
whatever  
gains*  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
made*  
in  
the  
so  
-  
called  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
War*  
on  
Terror  <ARG2
.  
"  

Unfortunately  >ARGM-DIS
,  
all  
the  
dangers  >ARG1
in  
the  
world  
are*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
match*  
for  
the  
self  >ARG0
-  
assurance*  
of  
a  
bubble  >ARG2
-  
encased*  
zealot  <ARG1
.  

What  
manner  >ARG0
of  
maniac  
would  >ARGM-MOD
undertake*  
such  
a  
dangerous  
course  <ARG1
?  

Look*  
no  
further  <ARG1
than  
1600  
Pennsylvania  
Avenue  
.  

George  >>ARG0
W.  
Bush  
and  
his  >ARG0
administration*  
have*  
consistently  >>ARGM-ADV
undertaken*  
incredibly  
dangerous  >ARGM-ADV
courses  <ARG1
of  
action*  
in  
order  
to  
garner*  
political  
power  <ARG1
on  
the  
home  
front  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Recall*  
the  
multiple  
terror  
threats  >ARG1
lobbed*  
out  <ARGM-PRD
by  
the  
administration*  
whenever  >ARGM-TMP
damaging  
political  
news  >ARG1
appeared*  
in  
the  
media  <ARGM-LOC
.  

More

recall*

Karl  >ARG0
Rove  
,  
Bush  
's  
most  
senior  
advisor  
,  
notoriously  >ARGM-ADV
told*  
Republicans  >ARG0
on  
the  
ballot  
during  
the  
2002  
midterms  
to  
"  
run*  
on  
the  
war*  
.  
"  

The  
invasion*  >ARG0
of  
Iraq  <ARG1
provided*  
marvelous  
political  
cover  <ARG1
for  
the  
GOP  
not  
only  
during  
those  
midterms  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
during  
the  
2004  >ARGM-TMP
Presidential  >ARG2
election*  
.  

What  
kind  >>ARG1
of  
political  
cover  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
gained*  
from  
an  
attack*  
on  
Iran  <ARG1
,  
and  
from  
the  
diversion*  
of  
attention*  
to  
that  
attack*  
?  

The  
answer*  >ARG1
lies*  
in  
one  
now  
-  
familiar  
name  <ARG2
:  
Jack  
Abramoff  
.  

The  
Abramoff  >>ARG2
scandal*  
threatens*  
to  
subsume*  
all  
the  
hard  
-  
fought  >ARGM-ADJ
GOP  >ARG0
gains*  
in  
Congress  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
the  
2006  
midterms  >ARG1
are*  
less  
than  
a  
year  
away  <ARG2
.  

Is*  
any  <ARG1
of  
this  
a  
probability  <ARG2
?  

Logic  >ARG0
says*  
no  <ARG1
,  
but  
logic  >ARG0
seldom  >ARGM-TMP
plays*  
any  
part  <ARG1
in

American  
politics  
.  

All  
arguments*  >>ARG0
that  
the  
Bush  >>ARG0
administration*  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
insane*  
to  
attack*

not

helping  
the  
Philippines  >ARG1
to  
plunge*  
in  
the  
pit  <ARG2
as  
they  >ARG1
are*  
the  
rot  <ARG2
of  
the  
country  
.  

They  >>ARG1
need*  
to  
be*  
expulse*  
from  
the  
country  <ARG2
and  
if  
they  >ARG1

not  <ARGM-NEG
there  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG2
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
banned*  
entering*  
the  
country  <ARG1
to  
plant*  
their  
eggs  <ARG1
,  
as  
they  >>ARG1

considered*  
as  
the  
rotten  
left  
overs  <ARGM-PRD
of  
dinasaurs  

Being*  
the  
texting  
capital  <ARG2

Would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
recommend*  
living*  
in  
Limerick  <ARGM-LOC
as  
a  
student  <ARGM-PRD
?  

I  >>ARG2
've*  
been*  
given*  
the  
opportunity  <ARG1
to  
live*  
in  
Limerick  <ARGM-LOC
,  
Ireland  
,  
next  
year  <ARGM-TMP
as  
part  <ARGM-ADV
of  
my  
course  
..  
if  
you  >ARG0
know*  >ARGM-ADV
about  
Limerick  <ARG1
,  
what  >ARG2
are*  
the  
pros  <ARG1
and  
cons  
?  

and  >ARGM-DIS
would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
recommend*  
it  <ARG1
as  
a  
student  <ARG3
?  

The  
L.I.T  >>ARG1
is*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
close*  
to  
Moyross  <ARG2
,  
yet  
again  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
ppl  >>ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
talk*  
sh*t  <ARG1
about  
Moyross  <ARGM-PRD
still  >ARGM-TMP
go*  
there  <ARG4
.  

Limerick  >ARG1
's*  
a  
great  
student  
city  <ARG2
,  
there  
's*  
loads  <ARG1
on  
,  
you  >>ARG1
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
spoilt*  
for  
choice*  
.  

In  
fact  >ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >>ARG0
probably  >ARGM-ADV
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
ever  >ARGM-TMP
want*  
to  
leave*  
.  

Orla  >ARG0
got*  
it  <ARG1

one  <ARGM-MNR

Although  
there  
is*  
'  
bad  
press  >ARG1

at  
AREA'S  <ARG2
of  
limerick  
,  
but  
nowhere  
near  
the  
university  
.  

Limerick  >ARG1
is*  
such  
a  
full  
city  <ARG2
,  
shopping*  
,  
night  
life  
,  
career  >ARG1
choices*  
,  
social  >ARGM-ADJ
choices*  
,  
I  >ARG1
came*  
here  <ARG4
about  
12  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
for  
college  <ARGM-PRP
.....  
and  
Orla  >ARG0
got*  
it  <ARG1
spot  
on  <ARG1
,  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
left*  
,  
nor  
would  
I  
.  

It  >ARG1
s*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
my  
home  <ARG2
.  

My  
myTouch  
4G  >ARG1
crashes*  
with  
most  
custom  
ROMs  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
install*  
.  

Can  >>ARGM-MOD
that  >>ARG1
be*  
fixed*  
?  

I  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-EXT
like*  
the  
MIUI  <ARG1
,  
but  
a  
process*  >ARG1
crashes*  
repeatedly  <ARGM-MNR
about  
every  
3  
seconds  <ARGM-TMP
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
load*  
the  
newest  
version  <ARG2
of  
Cyanogen  
Mod  
.  

not  
by  
the  
company  
...  
as  
you  >ARG0
voided*  
your  
warrenty  <ARG1
by  
installing*  
custom  
roms  <ARG1

you  >>ARG0
are*  
best*  
to  
either  
recover*  
to  
the  
standard  
ROM  <ARG1
,  
or  
find*  
one  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
crash*  
.  

cynangon  
mod  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
work*  
.  

Have*  
you  >>ARG0
tried*  
using*  
clockwork  >ARGM-MNR
recovery*  
?  

Get*  
the  
older  
version  <ARG1
of  
Cynagon  
mod  
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
use*  
a  
stable  
rom  <ARG1
like  
bugless  
beast  
and  
baked  
snake  
.  

Those  
roms  >ARG0
focus*  
on  
speed  <ARG2
and  
stability  
.  

Or  >ARGM-DIS
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
use*  
a  
home  
screen  >ARG1
launcher  >ARG1
replacement*  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
go  
launcher  <ARG1
or  
adw  
launcher  
.  

They  >>ARG0
are*  
both  >ARGM-ADV
excellent*  
and  
speed*  
up  
the  
phone  <ARG1
quite  
a  
bit  <ARGM-EXT
.  

As  
a  
mytouch  
4g  
owner  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
know*  
the  
phone  >>ARG1

pretty  >ARGM-EXT
fast*  
and  
their  
is*  
no  
point  <ARG1

Hope*  
you  >ARG0
read*  
through  
this  <ARG1

are*  
the  
moors  <ARG1

penines  
in  
Yorkshire  
a  
lonely

i  >ARG1

i  >>ARG1

penines  
at  
all  <ARGM-ADV

i  >ARG0

the  
penines  <ARG1
in  
the  
far  
distance  <ARGM-LOC
from  
my

window  <ARGM-DIR

when  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
watched*  >ARGM-TMP
werewolf  <ARG1
in  
london  
(  
great  
film  
)  
that  >ARG1
was*  
the  
only  
time  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
saw*  
the  
yorkshire  
moors  <ARG1
.  

can  >ARGM-MOD
anyone  >ARG0
give*  
me  <ARG2
information  <ARG1
about  
them  
?  

They  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
bleak*  
and  
eerie  
,  
often  
very  
exposed  
,  
often  
covered  
with  
antiquities  
like  
bronze  
age  
burial  
mounds  
,  
stone  
circles  
and  
settlements  
--  
until  
late  >ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
bronze  
age  
they  >ARG1
were*  
rich  
farmlands  <ARG2
,  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
change*  >ARG0
in  
the  
climate  <ARG1
caused*  
the  
skies  >ARG1
to  
cloud*  
over  <ARGM-PRD
and  
rain  >ARG2
to  
wash*  
the  
goodness  <ARG1
from  
the  
soil  <ARG3
.  

The  
people  >ARG0
abandoned*  
their  
farms  <ARG1
and  
religious  
sites  
and  
the  
ground  >>ARG1
they  >ARG1
stood*  
on  <C-ARG2
became*  
moorland  <ARG2
.  

They  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
also  >>ARGM-DIS
be*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
beautiful*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
purple  
heather  >ARG1
is*  
out  <ARG2
,  
and  
they  >ARG1
are*  
habitat  <ARG2
to  
much  
wildlife  
and  
many  
species  
of  
wildflowers  
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
western  
pleasure  
appy  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
s*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
heavy*  
on  
her  
left  
lead  <ARGM-LOC

the  
lope  <ARGM-LOC

My  
appy  >>ARG1
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
heavy*  
on  
her  
left  
lead  <ARGM-LOC
at  
the  
lope  <ARGM-LOC
.  

She  >>ARG0
seems*  
to  
lope*  
one  
stride*  
and  
trot*  
the  
next  <ARGM-TMP
and  
repeat*  
...  

How  >ARGM-MNR
could  >ARGM-MOD
I  >>ARG1
work*  
with  
her  <ARG3
to  
get*  
off  
her  
four  
hand  <ARG2
,  
get*  
balance  <ARG1
,  
and  
lope*  
smoothly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
slowly  
??  

Put*  
on  
a  
pair  <ARG1
of  
spurs  
and  
before  
she  >>ARG0
makes*  >>ARGM-TMP
that  
trot  >ARGM-MNR
step*  
,  
it  >ARG1
's*  
in  
the  
feeling*  >ARGM-TMP
when  >R-ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
feel*  
her  <ARG1
think*  
trot  <ARG1
,  
tick*  
her  <ARG1
with  
the  
spur  <ARGM-MNR
and  
lift*  
with  
your  
body  >ARG0
to  
keep*  
her  >ARG1
moving*  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
concentrate*  >ARGM-ADV
on  
that  
feel  <ARG1
just  
before  
the  
trot  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
figure*  
it  <ARG1
out  <C-V
and  
the  
timing*  >>ARG1
is*  
essential*  
to  
push*  
her  <ARG1
at  
that  
instant  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Lope*  
her  <ARG1
to  
the  
left  <ARGM-DIR
in  
circles  <ARG2
,  
keep*  
her  
head  <ARG1
to  
the  
inside  <ARG2
of  
the  
circle  
and  
push*  
her  <ARG1

out  <ARG2
,  
keep*  
doing*  
this  <ARG1
if  
she  >ARG0

to  
a

go*  
a  
little  
bit  
bigger  
circle  <ARG1

till  
she  >ARG0

enough

If

s  
visa  <ARG1
and  
it  >>ARG1

do*  
you  >>ARG0

to  
find*  
work*  
in  
the  
same  
sector  <<ARGM-LOC
as  
your  
skills  
on  
your  >ARG0

can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0

up  
other  >ARGM-ADJ

if  
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG

something  <ARG1
in  
your

I  >>ARG0

this

Watch*  
out  
the  
poles  >>ARG1
are*  
coming*  
.....  
my  
little

That  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
preferable  <ARG2
but  
it  >>ARG1
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
matter*  
,  
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
something  <ARG2
similar  

It  >ARG0
depends*  
on  
the  
conditions  <ARG1
of  
your  
skilled

.  

Your  
visa  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD

not  
you  >>ARG0

If  
your

not  >ARGM-NEG

you  <ARG1
from  
taking*  >ARGM-LVB
any  >ARGM-EXT
work*  
in  
New

then  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
work*  
in  
any  
sector  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
only  >ARGM-ADV
matters*  
if  
you  >ARG0
received*  
an  
offer*  
of  
employment*  
or  
if  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
currently  >ARGM-TMP
working*  
in  
New  
Zealand  <ARGM-LOC
and  
used*  
that  
job  <ARG1
in  
your  >ARG0

to  
get*  
your  
skilled

In  
Chicago  >ARGM-LOC
,  
what  >ARG2
is*  
the  
best  
restaurant  >ARGM-LOC
to  
dine*  
at  <C-ARGM-LOC
on  
a  
budget  <ARGM-MNR
?  

Downtown  
Chicago  
,  
Loop  
,  
North  

Take*  
the  
red  
line  <ARG1
to  
Clark  <ARG3
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
turn*  
right  <ARGM-DIR
.  

Walk*  
2  
blocks  <ARG2
then  >ARGM-TMP
turn*  
right  <ARGM-DIR
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Walk*  
2  
more  
blocks  <ARG2
then  >ARGM-TMP
cross*  
the  
street  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
to  
a  
place  >ARG1
called*  
"  
BIG  
BOWL  <ARG2
"  
.  

THAI  
FOOD  
AND  
ASIAN  
.  

BEST  
PLACE  
EVER  
!!!!!!!!!!!!  

McDonald  
s  

Not  
necessarily  
the  
restaurant  
but  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
order*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
get*  
there  <ARG2
and  
what  
time  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
go*  
.  

A  
lunch  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
less  >ARGM-CXN
expensive*  
than  
a  
dinner  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

You  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
order*  
appetizers  <ARG1
rather  
than  
a  
full  
meal  
and  
have*  
just  
as  
good  
a  
dinner  <ARG1
.  

But  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  >ARG1
is*  
to  
use*  
coupons  <ARG1
.  

Check*  
out  
http://www.restaurant.com  <ARG1
lots  
of  
restaurants  
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
look*  
at  
the  
menu  <ARG1
and  
check*  
out  
prices*  
.  

Yo  >>ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
may  >ARGM-MOD
want*  
to  
try*  
"  
small  
neighborhood  <ARG1
"  
restaurants  <C-ARG1
and  
support*  
family  
run  
places  <ARG1
rather  
than  
the  
large  
corporate  
chains  
.  

Not  
that  
there  
is*  
anything  <ARG1
wrong  
with  
that  
because  
they  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
employ*  
local  
people  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
live*  
and  
shop*  
in  
the  
area  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Is*  
there  
any  
cure*  
for  
mouse  
poison  <ARG2
?  

I  >ARG0
found*  
a  
poor  
little  
mouse  >ARG0
walking*  
around  <ARGM-DIR
in  
my  
friend  
s  
house  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
since  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
able*  >>ARGM-CAU
to  
catch*  
it  <ARG1
very  
easily  <ARGM-MNR
(  
normally  >ARGM-ADV
mice  >ARG0
move*  
at  
the  
speed  <ARGM-MNR
of  
light  
)  
,  
and  
since  
it  >>ARG0
was*  
acting*  
unresponsive*  
,  
I  >ARG0
thought*  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
infected*  
with  
mouse  
poison  <ARG2
,  
since  
my  
friend  >ARG0
uses*  
it  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
that  
the  
mouse  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
die*  
,  
but  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
wondering*  
if  
there  
is*  
any  
cure*  
for  
mouse  
poison  <ARG2
?  

I  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
hate*  
to  
see*  
the  
poor  
dears  >ARG0
experience*  
a  
slow  >ARGM-MNR
painful  >ARGM-MNR
death*  
that  
way*  
:(  
.  

Without  
knowing*  
the  
exact  
poison  <ARG1
,  
no  
.  

A  
common  
one  >ARG1
is*  
arsenic  <ARG2
and  
there  
really  >ARGM-ADV
is*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
a  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
to  
cure*  
that  <ARG2
.  

Take*  
the  
mouse  <ARG1
to  
an  
emergency  
vet  <ARG3
and  
have*  
them  >>ARG0
use*  
CO2  <ARG1
to  
put*  
the  
mouse  <ARG1
to  
sleep  <ARG2
.  

Or  >ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
put*  
the  
animal  <ARG1
in  
a  
snap  
trap  >ARG1
designed*  
for  
rats  <ARG2
or  
mice  
since  
that  >ARG1
is*  
the  
only  
really  
humane  
kill  
method  <ARG2
for  
invasive  
animals  
.  

A  
quick  >ARGM-ADJ
cure*  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
Arm  <ARG2
&  
Hammer  
to  
it's  
head  
.  

Crayola  
Air  
-  
Dry  
Clay  
?  

Ok  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
VERY  
long  
list  <ARG1
of  
people  >>ARG3
I  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
make*  
Xmas  
gifts  <ARG1
for  <C-ARG3
and  
one  >ARG1
of  
them  
is*  
my  
best  
friend  <ARG2
.  

She  >ARG0
loves*  
giraffes  <ARG1
and  
homemade  
things  
!  

I  >ARG1
am*  
very  
artistic  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
decided*  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
going*  
to  
make*  
her  <ARG3
a  
giraffe  
sculpture  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
much  
money  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
bought*  
Crayola  
Air  
-  
Dry  
Clay  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
sculpted*  
the  
giraffe  >ARG1
laying*  
down  <ARGM-DIR
.  

The  
key  >ARG1
is*  
...  
I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
few  
problems  <ARG1
:  

1  
.  
I  >>ARG0
tested*  
it  <ARG1
out  <ARGM-PRD
by  
making*  
a  
figure  
boat  <ARG1

And  >>ARGM-DIS
after  
4  
days  >>ARGM-TMP
when  
it  
dried  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
fragile*  
!  

(  
like  
VERY  
not  
in  
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  
)  

Is*  
there  
any  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
to  
strengthen*  
it  <ARG1
?  

2  
.  
What  
kind  >>ARG1
of  
paint  
do*  
I  >>ARG0
use*  
to  
paint*  
the  
giraffe  <ARG1
?  

3  
.  
Is*  
there  
any  
cheap  >ARGM-MNR
way*  >ARGM-MNR
to  
give*  
it  <ARG2
a  
shine  <ARG1
like  
I  >ARG0
made*  
it  <ARG1
in  
a  
kiln  <ARGM-LOC
?  

air  
dry  
clay  >ARG0
works*  
on  
armatures  <ARG1
,  
the  
clay  >ARG0
has*  
a  
minor  
shrink  
percent  <ARG1
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
leave*  
the  
wire  
armature  <ARG1
inside  <ARG1
,  
paint*  
with  
acrylic  
paint  <ARG2

taking*  
young  
cat  <ARG1
with  
me  <ARGM-COM
for  
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
out  
of  
state  <ARG3
?  

good  
idea  
?  

i  >ARG0
have*  
a  
3  
-  
4  
month  
old  
kitten  <ARG1
and  
i  >ARG0
live*  
in  
forida  <ARGM-LOC
.  

i  >>ARG0
am*  
going*  
to  
my  
grandma  <ARG4
s  
in  
north  
carolina  
and  
we  >>ARG0
are*  
going*  
camping*  
in  
a  
cabin  <ARG1
in  
west  
virginia  
.  

My  
cat  >ARG1
is*  
a  
outside  
cat  <ARG2
but  
she  >ARG0
loves*  
it  <ARG1
inside  <ARGM-LOC
.  

she  >>ARG1
is*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
good*  
in  
a  
carrier  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Should  >ARGM-MOD
i  >ARG0
bring*  
her  <ARG1
?  

if  
so  
how  
quick  >ARGM-MNR
will  >ARGM-MOD
she  >ARG0
adapt*  
to  
a  
litter  
box  <ARG2
inside  
?  

thanks*  

We  >ARG0
took*  
our  
cat  <ARG1
Mitten  
camping*  
.  

He  >ARG0
loved*  
it  <ARG1
.  

But  
he  >ARG1
was*  
an  
inside  
/  
outside  
cat  <ARG2
(  
only  
one  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
owned*  
-  
rest  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
100  
0nside  
cats  <ARG2
)  
.  

He  >>ARG2
was*  
trained*  
to  
a  
harness  <ARG1
/  
leash  
for  
outside  
time  <ARGM-TMP
but  
he  >>ARG0
knew*  
to  
use*  
the  
litter  
pan  <ARG1
inside  <ARGM-LOC
.  

If  
your  
cat  >>ARG0
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
trained*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
use*  
the  
litter  
pan  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
a  
problem  <ARG1
taking*  
her  <ARG1
.  

NO  
!  

changing*  >ARG0
its  
surroundings  <ARG1
too  
often  <ARGM-TMP
will  >ARGM-MOD
stress*  
it  <ARG1
out  <C-V
and  
it  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
get*  
depressed*  
,  
mean*  
,  
sick*  
,  
or  
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
be*  
around  
you  <ARG2
.  

What  
cleaners  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
use*  
for  
dusting*  
around  
my  
parakeet  <ARGM-LOC
?  

What  
cleaners  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
use*  
to  
dust*  
around  
my  
budgie  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
pledge  >ARG1
be*  
ok  <ARG2
?  

If  
not  
,  
what  >ARG1
is*  
?  

Your  >ARG0
best  >ARGM-ADJ
bet*  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
a  
swiffer  
duster  <ARG2
--  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
require*  
cleaner  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
use*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
cleaner  <ARG1
,  
pledge  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
fine*  
if  
the  
area  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARGM-LOC
you  >ARG0
keep*  
your  
parakeet  <ARG1
in  <C-ARGM-LOC
is*  
well  
ventilated  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
had*  
parakeets  <ARG1
for  
a  
VERY  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
use*  
pledge  <ARG1
.  

Just  >ARGM-DIS
keep*  
a  
window  >ARG1
open*  
for  
a  
while  <<ARGM-TMP
for  
fresh  
air  >ARG1
to  
circulate*  
.  

I  >ARG0
agree*  
w  
the  
answer*  
from  
Nothing  <ARG0
.  

Even  
a  
cotton  
cloth  >>ARG1
(  
I  >ARG0
like*  
diapers  <ARG1
)  
that  >>R-ARG1
is*  
barely  >ARGM-EXT
damp*  
w  
water  <ARG2
will  >ARGM-MOD
work*  
fine  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Swiffer  >>ARG0
or  
any  
type  
of  
micro-fiber  
cloth  
is*  
excellent*  
.  

I  >ARG0
use*  
Miracle  
Cloth  <ARG1
,  
they  >>ARG1
're*  
fantastic*  
,  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
use*  
fabric  
softener  <ARG1
or  
dryer  
sheets  
when  >ARGM-TMP
cleaning*  
them  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG0
ruins*  
their  
"  
grabbing  
"  
ability  <ARG1

want*  
to

a

Yes  >>ARGM-DIS
obviously  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
USB  >>ARG1
is*  
region  >ARG2
free*  
which  >ARG1
means*  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
use*  
it  <ARG1
anywhere  <ARGM-LOC
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
every  
computer  >>ARG1
manufactured*  
in  
both  
Ireland  <ARGM-LOC
&  
the  
UK  
are*  
Region  <ARG2
2  
aka  
PAL  
.  

There  
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
a  
difference*  
since  
mobile  
broadband  >>ARG1
is*  
supposed*  
to  
be*  
digital  <ARG2
.  

But  
word  
of  
advice  
if  
you  >>ARG0
're*

yes  
of  
course  
you  
can  
....  

I  >ARG0
have*  
many  
friends  >>ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
have*  
laptops  >ARG1
bought*  
in  
the  
UK  <ARGM-LOC
that  >R-ARG0
use*  
them  <ARG1
here  <ARGM-LOC

If  
in

then  >ARGM-ADV
yes  >ARGM-DIS
USB  
sticks  >ARG1
are*  
the  
same  <ARG2
any  
were  >ARG4
you  >ARG0
go*  
:)  
hope*  
that  >ARG0
answered*  
your  
question  <ARG1
.  

How  >>ARGM-MNR
do*  
I  >>ARG0
take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
my  
newborn  
baby  
fish  <ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG1
am*  
nervous*  
that  
my  
other  
fish  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
eat*  
them  <ARG1
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
what  >ARG1
to  
feed*  
them  <ARG2
!  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
counted*  
around  
25  <ARG2
of  
them  
and  
they  >ARG0
currently  >ARGM-TMP
reside*  
in  
a  
20  
gallon  
tank  <ARG1
.  

You  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
move*  
all  
the  
babies  <ARG1
into  
a  
fry  
net  
breeder  <ARG2
or  
move*  
all  <ARG1
of  
the  
bigger  
fish  
(  
also  
the  
parents  
)  
to  
a  
different  
tank  <ARG2
to  
avoid*  
the  
babies  >>ARG1
getting*  
eaten*  
.  

Feed*  
the  
babies  <ARG2
3  
-  
4  
times  <ARGM-TMP
a  
day  
with  
flakes  <ARG1
.  

Provide*  
plenty  <ARG1
of  
hiding  
places  
like  
rocks  
,  
plants  
,  
etc  
in  
the  
tank  <ARGM-LOC
.  

It  
s*  
natural*  
for  
some  
babies  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
eaten*  
by  
adults  <ARG0
and  
if  
all  >ARG0
of  
them  
survived*  >>ARGM-ADV
your  
tank  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
overcrowded*  
.  

Look*  
in  
the  
pet  
stores  <ARGM-LOC
for  
"  
fry  
food  <ARG1
"  
or  
"

foods  
"  
.  

what  
kind  >ARG1
of  
newborn  
fish  
you  >ARG0
have*  
?  

some  
parents  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
eat*  
there  
fish  <ARG1
till  
a  
certain  
age  <ARGM-TMP
jack  
dempsey  >ARG0
for  
example  >ARGM-ADV
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
eat*  
there  
offspring  <ARG1
till  
they  >ARG1
mature*  
but  
i  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
move*  
the  
baby  
fish  <ARG1
into  
a  
smaller  
tank  <ARG2
and  
feed*  
them  <ARG2
flakes  <ARG1

I  >ARG0

becca  >>ARG1

right*  
.  

i  >>ARG0
v*

for  
ovr  
3  
yrs  <ARGM-TMP
and  
i  >ARG0

they  >>ARG1

eneedle  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
but  
they  >>ARG1
ar*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
pillow  >ARGM-EXT
soft*  
.  

they  >>ARG0
use*  
them  <ARG1
to  
look*  
prickly  <ARG1
..  
would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >>ARG0
try*  
to  
eat*  
a  
cactus  <ARG1
[  
if  
u  >ARG0
had*  
no  
knife  <ARG1
]  
i  >ARG0
know*  
i  
would  <ARG1
nt  
.  

they  >>ARG1
puff*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
to  
look*  
bigger*  
and  
badder  
and  
they  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD

you  <ARG1
a  
lil  <ARGM-EXT
if  
u  >>ARG0
r*  
holding*  
them  <ARG1

:)  

They  >>ARG1
re*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-EXT
hard*  
.  

Beardies  >ARG1
are*  
actually  <ARGM-ADV
quite  
delicate  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
assuming*  
it  >ARG1
's*  
to  
scare*  
off  <ARG3
predators  <ARG1
/  
like  
how  >ARGM-MNR
they  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
puff*  
up  
their  
neck  
spikes  <ARG1
to  
make*  
them  >>ARG1
look*  
bigger*  
to  
predators  <ARGM-GOL
or  
enemies  
.  

they  >>ARG0
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
hurt*  
unless  
you  >>ARG0
r*  
stupid*  >ARG2
enough*  
to  
press*  
on  
them  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-ADV
are*  
there  <ARG2
as  
an  
adaptation*  
.  

what  >>ARG2
is*  
a  
kimberwick  
bit  >ARG1
used*  
for  <C-ARG2
?  

Used*  
as  
a  
help*  
for  
horses  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
are*  
quite  
strong  
pullers  <ARG2
while  
hacking*  
,  
hunting*  
and  
doing*  
cross  
country  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
a  
curb  
bit  <ARG2
with  
a  
ported  
mouth  
piece  
and  
some  
horses  >ARG0
appreciate*  
this  <ARG1
to  
give*  
them  <ARG2
more  
room  <ARG1
in  
their  
mouths  
for  
their  
tongues  
.  

It  >>ARG0
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
as  >ARGM-CXN
precise*  
as  
a  
pelham  
bit  <C-ARGM-CXN
because  
it  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
uses*  
one  
rein  <ARG1
,  
though  
the  
modern  
ones  >ARG0
have*  
two  
or  
three  
slots  >ARG2
on  
which  >R-ARG2
to  
put*  
the  
reins  <ARG1
.  

The  
lower*  
the  
reins  <ARG2
,  
the  
stronger  
the  
action*  
and  
the  
lower*  
the  
reins  <ARG2
the  
stronger  
the  
action*  
on  
the  
poll*  
too  
.  

Useful  
for  
younger  
kids  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
big  
enough  
hands  <ARG1
or  
the  
ability  
to  
handle*  
two  
reins  <ARG1
independently  <ARGM-MNR
.  

For  
horses  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
are*  
strong  
pullers  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
gives*  
you  <ARG2
a  
little  
leverage*  
and  
curb  
pressure  
.  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
nice*  
for  
horses  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
need*  
a  
little  
more  <ARG1
than  
a  
snaffle  
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
that  >>ARG1
's*  
vague*  
,  
but  
it  >ARG0
depends*  
on  
the  
horse  <ARG1
.  

The  
rider  >>ARG0
needs*  
to  
have*  
independent  
hands  <ARG1
as  <ARGM-DIS
well  
,  
because  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
pull*  
too  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
on  
a  
bit  <ARG1
like  
that  
.

to  
do*  >ARGM-LVB
sculpting*  >>ARG1

which  >>R-ARG1

the

more

My

If  
yes  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
need*  
to  
change*  
it  <ARG1
because  
you  >ARG0
board*  
later  <ARGM-TMP

If  
no  
,  
you  >>ARG0
'll

In  
Calcutta  >ARGM-LOC

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG

you  <ARG1

it  >ARG1
is*  
close  <ARG2

in

so  >ARGM-ADV
check*  
a  
few  
big  
ones  <ARG1
?  

Even  
if  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG

well  >>ARGM-DIS
if

more

2  >ARGM-ADJ

3

then  >>ARGM-ADV
the

you

me  <ARG2
about  
25

,  
now  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
no

me  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
on  
September  <ARGM-TMP

,  
I  >ARG0

a

that  >R-ARG0

me  <ARG1

or  >>ARGM-DIS
do*  
I  >>ARG0
need*  
to

?  

(  
in  
the

,  
it  >>ARG0

would  >ARGM-MOD

getting*  
an

it  >ARG0

it  <ARG4
a

I  >>ARG0
've*

I  >>ARG0

My

They  >ARG0

What  >ARG2

the

Hotels  >>ARG1

will  >>ARGM-MOD

expensive*  
.  

anybody  >>ARG1
is*  
open*  
to  
answers*  
but  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
much  >ARGM-ADV
prefere*  
somebody  <ARG1

traveling  >ARG1
experience*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
go*  
all  
over  <ARGM-LOC
:)  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
a  
set  
route  <ARG1
yet  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Get*  
a  
back  
pack  <ARG1
and  
sleeping  
bag  
or  
good  
warm  
blanket  
.  

Wool  >>ARG1
is*  
best*  
.  

Light  
,  
warm  
,  
but  
also  
itchy  
.  

Hit*  
the  
road  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
always  >ARGM-TMP
beg*  
for  
spare  
change  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
get*

.  

Should  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
some  
survival  
skills  <ARG1
before  
setting*  
out  
on  
your

Vietnamese  
girl  
's  
name  
,  
Mayko  
?  

I  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
thought*  
Mayko  >ARG1
or  
Meiko  
is*  
a  
Japanese

.  

The  
Canadian  
Regenesis

Mayko  
Nguyen  
has*  
Japanese  >ARG2

is*  
it  <ARG1
her  
fake

?  

Right  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
find*  
any  
proven

that  
.  

And  
her

,

is*  
a  
typical  
Vietnamese  
family  
name  <ARG2
...  
anyone  
?  

Certainly  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Nguyen  >ARG1
is*  
the  
one  <ARG2
of  
first  
names  
of  
many  
people  
in  
Vietnam  
,  
only

.  

Mayko  >>ARG1
is*  
relating*  
to  
the  
Japanese  <ARG2
.  

In  
Vietnam  >>ARGM-LOC
,  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
baby  >>ARG1
was*  
born*  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >>ARG1
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
named*  
"  
first  
name  <ARG2
"  
according  
to  
that  <ARGM-ADV
of  
their  
fathers  
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
principle  <ARG2
except  
a  
number  <ARGM-ADV
of  
cases*  
,  
for  
example  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
babies  >>ARG0
are*  
orphans  <ARG2
or  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
have*  
father  <ARG1
.  

E.g  
.  

Full  
name  >ARG1
of  
the  
father  
is*  
:  
"  
Nguyen  <ARG2
Thanh  
Luan  
"  
===>  
Full  
name  >ARG1
of  
the  
son  
/  
daughter  
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
is*  
"  
Nguyen  <ARG2
..........  
"  
,  
for  
instance  
,  
"  
Nguyen  
Thi  
Thuy  
Lan  
"  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
if  
the  
babies  >>ARG1
were*  
born*  >>ARGM-ADV
in  
American  <ARGM-LOC
so  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
named*  
in  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  
but  
still  >ARGM-TMP
remain*  
"  
First  
name  <ARG3
"  
in  
order  
to  
recall*  
about  
their  >ARG1
origination*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
pretty  >ARGM-ADJ
sure*  
that  
Mayko  >ARG1
is*  
Japanese  <ARG2
.  

She  >ARG1
is*  
a  
Canadian  
born  <ARG2
Vietnamese  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure*  
where  >ARG2
her  
first  
name  >ARG1
is*  
from  <C-ARG2
...  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
splitter  
/  
filter  <ARG1
between  
my  
ADSL  
and  
ph  
line  
?  

I  >ARG0
have*  
2  
phones  >ARG1
running*  
on  
the  
same  
line  <ARG4
and  
the  
ADSL  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
connected*  
to  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
phones  
and  
the  
filter  
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
getting*  
a  
buzzing  <ARG1
noise  
even  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
have*  
disconnected*  
the  
other  
phone  <ARG1
without  
one  
.  

Why  >>ARGM-CAU
is*  
it  >ARG0
stil  >ARGM-TMP
doing*  
this  <ARG1
even  
though  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
the  
other  
phone  >ARG1
connected*  
?  

Woud  >>ARGM-MOD
it  >ARG1
be*  
better*  
if  
I  >>ARG0
got*  
another  
filter  <ARG1
and  
connected*  
the  
other  
phone  <ARG1
as  <ARGM-DIS
well  
?  

turn*  
the  
modem  <ARG1
off  <C-V
and  
see*  
if  
the  
sound*  >ARG1
is*  
still  <ARGM-TMP
there  <ARG2
...  
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
static  <ARG2
on  
the  
line  
...  
if  
the  
sound*  >ARG1
is*  
still  <ARGM-TMP
there  >ARGM-ADV
with  
the  
modem  <ARGM-ADV
off  
then  >ARGM-ADV
the  
problem  >ARG1
is*  
NOT  <ARGM-NEG
the  
DSL  <ARG2
....  

if  
the  
trouble  >ARG1
goes*  >ARGM-ADV
away  <ARGM-DIR
with  
the  
modem  <ARGM-MNR
off  
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
make*  
sure*  
that  
EVERYTHING  >>ARG1
EXCEPT  
the  
modem  
is*  
filtered*  
,  
this  >ARG2
would  >ARGM-MOD
include*  
the  
alarm  
system  <ARG1
,  
fax  
machine  
,  
satellite  
boxes  
,  
phones  
,  
etc  
...  

if  
everything  >>ARG1
is*  
filtered*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
and  
you  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
have*  
this  
problem  <ARG1
-  
try*  
changing*  
the  
filter  <ARG1
-  
if  
it  >ARG1
is*  
still  <ARGM-TMP
there  >ARGM-ADV
,  
try*  
doubling*  
up  <ARGM-PRD
on  
the  
filters  <ARG1
...  

You  >ARG0
need*  
either  
a  
filter  <ARG1
for  
each  
device  
except  
the  
DSL  
modem  
,  
or  
a  
whole  
home  
filter  >ARG0
which  >R-ARG0
filters*  
all  
the  
jacks  <ARG1
,  
except  
the  
one  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
the  
DSL  
modem  >ARG0
connects*  
.  

Best  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  >ARGM-MNR
to  
change*  
35  
mm  
film  <ARG1
in  
Holga  
120  
whilst  
out  <ARGM-TMP
and  
about  
?  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
modified*  
my  
Holga  >ARG0
120  
to  
take*  
35  
mm  
film  <ARG1
and  
I  >ARG0
know*  
that  
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
wind*  
the  
film  <ARG1
back  <ARG2
,  
you  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
open*  
the  
back  <ARG1
of  
the  
camera  
(  
in  
a  
darkroom  <ARGM-LOC
)  
to  
rewind*  
the  
film  <ARG1
.  

What  >>ARG1
do*  
other  
Holga  
owners  >ARG0
do*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
change*  
film  <ARG1
when  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
are*  
traveling*  
?  

Do*  
you  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
take*  
a  
changing  
bag  <ARG1
with  
you  <ARGM-COM
?  

What  >ARG2
s*  
the  
easiest  
thing  <ARG1
?  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
a  
changing  
bag  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
easiest  >ARGM-ADJ
solution*  
.  

It  >>ARG0
's*  
light  
proof  <ARG2
and  
makes*  
sure*  
you  >>ARG0
get*  
no  
problems  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
opening*  
the  
camera  <ARG1
.  

You  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
work*  
comfortably  <ARGM-MNR
and  
make*  
sure*  
your  
film  >>ARG1
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
scratched*  
etc  
.  

It  
's*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
difficult*  
to  
find*  
a  
place  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is*  
absolutely  >ARGM-EXT
dark*  
and  
accessible*  
to  
you  <ARG0
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
're*  
outside  <ARG2
.  

A  
changing  
bag  >>ARG0
folds*  
neatly  <ARGM-ADV
and  
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
take*  
much  
space  <ARG1
in  
your  
bag  
.  

A  
film  
changing  
bag  >ARG1
is*  
a  
handy  >ARGM-MNR
way*  
of  
unloading*  
your  
exposed  
film  <ARG2
in  
the  
field  <ARGM-LOC
.

online

Should  >>ARGM-MOD

You  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
is  >ARG1
was*  
because  
of

Better

my

out  <ARGM-DIR

I  >>ARG1

HAMSTERS

in

in

?  

or  >>ARGM-DIS

the

be*  
a  
problem  <ARG2

If  
space  >>ARG1
is*  
minimal*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
or  
you  >>ARG1
are*  
keeping*  
him  <ARG1
in  
there  <ARG2
to  
be*  
kept*  
away  <ARG2
from  
other  
pets  
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
understand*  
why  >ARGM-CAU
you  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
choose*  
to  
keep*  
him  <ARG1
there  <ARG2
.  

There  
are*  
some  
things  >ARG1
to  
consider*  
though  <ARGM-DIS
...  

Rodents  >ARG0
require*  
special  >ARGM-ADJ
bedding*  
in  
their  
cages  <<ARGM-LOC
to  
absorb*  
their  >ARG0
waste*  
,  
and  
this  >>ARG1
needs*  
to  
be*  
cleaned*  
regularly  <ARGM-TMP
,  
or  
your  
hamster  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
suffer*  
from  
problems  <ARG1
due  
the  
buildup*  
of  
ammonia  <ARG1
from  
his  
urine  
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
take*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
warm  >ARGM-ADJ
shower*  
and  
build*  
up  
steam  <ARG1
,  
his  
cage  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
collect*  
water  <ARG1
,  
the  
bedding*  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
absorb*  
much  <ARG1
of  
it  
,  
and  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
able*  
to  
absorb*  
the  
urine  <ARG1
quite  
as  
it  
should  <ARGM-MNR
.  

You  >>ARG1
will  
also  
have*  
to  
be*  
wary  <ARG2
of  
mold  >ARG1
forming*  
on  
any  
toys  <ARGM-LOC
or  
hide  
-  
aways  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
.  

You  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
it  >>ARG1
getting*  
too  >ARGM-CXN
warm*  
for  
him  <C-ARGM-CXN
too  
often  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Overall  >ARGM-ADV
,  
it  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
solution*  
,  
but  
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
keep*  
him  >ARG2
healthy*  
and  
pull*  
it  <ARG1
off  <C-V
if  
you  >>ARG0
take*  
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
give*  >ARGM-LVB
him  >ARG1
the  
extra  >ARGM-ADJ
care*  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
because  
of  
it  <ARGM-CAU
.  

It  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
problem  <ARG2
because  
the  
temperature  >>ARG1
is*  
constantly  >ARGM-ADV
changing*  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
personally  >ARGM-MNR
put*  
him  <ARG1
somewhere  <ARG2
else  
.

most  
interesting  
place  >ARG1

it  
's*

in  
my

its

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
currently  >>ARGM-TMP

?  

What  >ARG1

feed*  
it  <ARG2
?  

Is*  
normal

(  
Because

my  
mom  >ARG1
is*  
very  
picky  >ARGM-ADV
,  
she  >ARG0
says*  
the  
bird  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
get*  
sick*  
if  
it  >>ARG0
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
eat*  
the

cheapest

I  >>ARG0

to

my

job  <ARG1
from  
South

the  
cheapest

also  >ARGM-ADV
good*  
in  
his  
artwork  <ARG2
on  
a  
human  
s  
body  
.  

Only  
a  
fool  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
base*  
a  
decision*  >ARG0
using*  
the  
cheapest  
surgeon  >ARG0
to  
perform*  
an  
operation*  
.  

Cheapest  
surgeons  >>ARG0
work*  
out  
of  
some  
small  
clinic  <ARGM-LOC
and  
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
the  
skills  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
are*  
looking*  
for  <C-ARG1
.  
.  

Do*  
you  >>ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
want*  
to  
put*  
your  
faith  <ARG1
in  
some  
clinic  
doctor  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
I  
would  <ARG1
n't  
.  

You  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
check*  
with  
one  <ARGM-COM
of  
the  
major  
hospital  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
performance*  
this  
procedure*  
like  
Bumrungard  
Hospital  
or  
Yanhee  
Hospital  
.  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
choose*  
the  
cheapest  
brakes  <ARG1
for  
your  
expensive  
race  
car  
or  
maybe  
the  
cheapest  
parachute  
too  
?  

Sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
the  
"  
cheap  >ARG1
"  
comes*  
expensive*  
!  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
have*  >>ARGM-TMP
invasive  
surgery  <ARG1
you  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
also  >>ARGM-DIS
get*  
infections*  
,  
accidental  
nicks  >>ARG0
and  
cuts*  
that  >R-ARG0
cause*  
other  
problems  <ARG1
too  <ARGM-ADV
!  

If  
they  >ARG0
screw*  >ARGM-ADV
up  
you  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
in  
worse  >ARGM-CXN
shape*  
than  
you  >ARG1
are*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
!  

Bumrungrad  
Hospital  >ARG0
does*  
some  >ARGM-EXT
good  >ARGM-ADJ
work*  
but  
all  
hospitals  >>ARG0
do*  
have*  
their  
problems  <ARG1
from  
time  <ARGM-TMP
to  
time  
.  

Maybe  >ARGM-ADV
having*  >>ARG1
an  
experienced  
doctor  <ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
better*  
than  
some  
guy  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is*  
cheaper*  
but  
less

done*  
very  
well  <ARGM-MNR
and  
like*  
the  
dry  
food  <ARG1
better  <ARGM-ADV
.  

It  >ARG0
had*  
better  
nutritional  
value  <ARG1
and  
it  >>ARG1
s*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
less  >ARGM-EXT
expensive*  
.  

Canned*  
food  >ARG1
is*  
often  <ARGM-TMP
suspect  <ARG2
as  
to  
the  
actual  
contents  <ARGM-MNR
and  
you  >>ARG0
're*  
paying*  
for  
a  
high  
moisture  
content  <ARG3
instead  
of  
food  
content  <ARG3
.  

There  
are*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
good  
quality  
dry  
cat  
foods  
.  

Read*  
the  
labels  <ARG1
for  
contents  <ARG3
.  

Your  
cat  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
adjust*  
quickly  <ARGM-TMP
.  

You  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
have*  
less  
spoilage  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
sick*  
take*  
him  <ARG1
to  
the  
vet  <ARG3
to  
see*  

If  
he  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
does*  
this  <ARG1
,  
welcome  
to  
the  
club  
.  

My  
oldest  
female  >ARG0
and  
youngest  
male  
do*  
this  <ARG1
-  
I  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-DIS
grab*  
the  
blender  <ARG1
and  
pop*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
some  
other  
stuff  <ARG1
for  
them  <ARGM-GOL
like  
chicken  
liver  >ARG1
(  
cooked*  
)  
for  
the  
anemic  
one  
,  
some  
arthritis  
stuff  
for  
the  
oldest  
.  

Even  
if  
you  >ARG0
mash*  >ARGM-ADV
it  <ARG1
with  
a  
spoon  <ARGM-MNR
he  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
that  <ARG1
,  

What  >ARG2
s*  
your  
favorite  
part  <ARG1
about  
trail  >ARGM-LOC
riding*  
?  

My  
favorite  
part  >ARG1
is*  
going*  
up  
hill  <ARGM-DIR
and  
cantering*  
:)  

I  >ARG0
love*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
it  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
depends*  
on  
how  
good  >ARG2
a  
horse  
your  
horse  >ARG1
really  >ARGM-ADV
is*  
,  
not  
how  
talented  >ARG2
he  >ARG1
is*  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
took*  >>ARGM-ADV
some  
Olympic  
-  
level  
horses  <ARG1
on  
a  
trail  >ARGM-LOC
ride*  
,  
they  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
it  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
too  >ARGM-EXT
scared*  
and  
spooky  
.  

It  >>ARG1
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
matter*  
how  
graceful  >ARG2
your  
horse  >ARG1
is*  
,  
or  
how  
high  >ARGM-EXT
he  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
jump*  
,  
or  
how  
well  >>ARGM-MNR
he  >>ARG0
does*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
sliding  >ARGM-PRD
stop*  
.  

What  >>ARG1
matters*  
is*  
how  
well  
trained  >ARG2
he  >ARG1
is*  
,  
and  
how  >>ARG2
good  >>ARG2
your  >ARG1
bond*  >ARG1
it*  
.  

That  >ARG1
is*  
another  
reason  >ARGM-CAU
why  >R-ARGM-CAU
I  >ARG0
like*  
competitive  >ARGM-MNR
trail  >ARGM-LOC
riding*  
also  <<ARGM-DIS
.  

Nobody  >>ARG0
pays*  
someone  <ARG2
to  
keep*  
their  
horse  <ARG1
in  
shape*  
and  
rides*  
once  <ARGM-TMP
a  
week  
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
takes*  
all  
the  
ribbons  <ARG1
at  
the  
show*  
because  
their  
horse  >>ARG1
is*  
good*  
.  

YOU  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
spend*  
the  
time  <ARG1
training*  
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
have*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
met*  
one  
stuck  
-  
up  
trail  
rider  <ARG1
!  

Those  >ARG1
are*  
just  
a  
few  
reasons  >ARGM-CAU
why  >R-ARGM-CAU
I  >ARG0
love*  
trail  >ARGM-LOC
riding*  
,  
competitive  <ARGM-MNR
or  
not  
.  

Same*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
galloping*  >ARGM-TMP
in  
an  
open  
space  <ARG1
like  
that  <ARGM-MNR
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
forget*  
everything  <ARG1
.  

Seeing*  
the  
nature  <ARG1
and  
wild  
life  
that  
if  
you  >>ARG1
keep*  >>ARGM-ADV
quiet*  
you  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
get  
up  >ARGM-ADV
close*  
and  
personal*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
had*  >ARGM-LVB
several  >ARGM-ADJ
close  >ARGM-ADJ
encounters*  
with  
both  
foxes  <ARG1
and  
wild  
deer  
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
woodpeckers  >>ARG0
were*  
pecking*  
in  
the  
trees  <ARGM-LOC
and  
I  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
sat*  
and  
watched*  
.  

Fascinating  
.  

10  
gallon  
nano  
reef  
ideas  
?  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
10  
gallon  
nano  
reef  <ARG1
with  
10  
lbs  
of  
live  
fiji  
rock  
,  
and  
10  
lbs  
of  
live  
carribean  
sand  
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
aware*  
of  
the  
maintenance*  >ARG1
involved*  
in  
keeping*  
a  
tank  <ARG1
this  
size  
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
currently  >ARGM-TMP
maintaining*  
a  
gravity  
level  <ARG1
of  
1.024  
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
10  
gallon  
filter  <ARG1
on  
it  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
have*  
a  
powerhead  <ARG1
,  
getting*  
another  <ARG1
soon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
few  
questions  <ARG1
,  
first  <ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
start*  
a  
sump  
filter  <ARG1
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
have*  
no  
idea  <ARG1
on  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
the  
water  >ARG1
intake*  >>ARG1
and  
water  >ARG1
return*  
would  >ARGM-MOD
work*  
.  

How  >ARGM-MNR
would  >ARGM-MOD
I  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
set*  
a  
sump  <ARG1
for  
this  
10  
gallon  
?  

Do*  
I  >ARG0
need*  
a  
protein  
skimmer  <ARG1
or  
any  
other  
equipment  
?  

thanks*  

Unless  
the  
tank  >ARG0
has*  
a  
built  
in  
overflow  
box  <ARG1
(  
which  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
certain*  
it  
does*  
n't  
)  
then  
you  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
get*  
one  <ARG1
of  
those  
hang*  
on  
back  <ARG2
overflow  
boxes  
so  
that  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
install*  
a  
sump  <ARG1
.  

The  
piping  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
lead*  
down  <ARG4
into  
your  
sump  
from  
the  
overflow  
box  <ARG3
.  

On  
the  
other  
end  >ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
sump  
,  
you  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
a  
small  
return  
pump  <ARG1
with  
a  
hose  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
puts*  
the  
water  <ARG1
back  <ARG2
into  
your  
tank  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
're*  
going*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
go*  
through  
the  
trouble  <ARG1
of  
creating*  
a  
sump  <ARG1
for  
this  
tank  
,  
getting*  >ARG1
a  
protein  
skimmer  <ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
a  
bad  
idea  <ARG2
.  

The  
Hydor  
SlimSkim  
Nano  >ARG1
is*  
a  
good  
nano  
protein  
skimmer  <ARG2
,  
it  >ARG1
's*  
an  
in  
-  
tank  >ARGM-ADJ
design*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
easily  >ARGM-MNR
sit*  
in  
your  
sump  <ARG2
.  

NOOK  
Color  
or  
NOOK  
Tablet  
?  

From  
what  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
understand*  
they  >ARG1
're*  
pretty  
much  <ARGM-ADV
the  
same  
thing  <ARG2
.  

Some  >>ARG1
of  
the  
major  >ARGM-EXT
differences*  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
see*  
is*  
the  
HD  
video  <ARG2
,  
longer  
battery  
life  
,  
and  
faster  
processor  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
the  
NOOK  
Tablet  >ARG0
boasts*  
.  

Does*  
the  
Tablet  >>ARG1
have*  
a  
major  >ARGM-EXT
difference*  
in  
speed  <ARG3
compared  
to  
the  
Color  <ARG2
?  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
an  
iPad  <ARG1
or  
Kindle  
.  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
want*  
an  
e-reader  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
does*  
a  
little  
bit  
more  <ARG1
than  
just  >ARGM-ADV
read*  
.  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
know*  
about  
the  
Kindle  
Fire  <ARG1
but  
that  >ARG1
's*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
want*  
(:  
Does*  
it  
make*  >ARGM-LVB
sense*  
to  
shell*  
out  
the  
extra  
fifty  
dollars  <ARG1
?  

Or  >ARGM-DIS
just  >ARGM-ADV
purchase*  
the  
Color  <ARG1
?  

Well  
I  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
bought*  
the  
Nook  
Color  <ARG1
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
say*  
that  
I  >>ARG1
am*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
happy*  
with  
it  <ARG0
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
like  
a  
mini  
tablet  <ARG2
itself  <ARGM-PRD
!  

When  
I  >ARG0
found*  >>ARGM-TMP
out  
them  >ARG0
came*  
up  
with  
the  
Nook  
Tablet  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG1
was*  
pretty  
disappointed  <ARG2
though  <ARGM-ADV
,  
because  
I  >ARG0
bought*  
my  
Nook  
color  <ARG1
for  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
darn  >ARGM-ADJ
price*  
!  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
say*  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
for  
the  
more  
updated  
Nook  
Tablet  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
pretty  >ARGM-ADV
sure*  
it  >>ARG1
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
worth*  
it  <ARG2
.  

Have*  >ARGM-LVB
fun*  
!  

Judging*  >>ARGM-ADV
by  
Nook  
Tablet  
's  
processor  <ARG3
it  >>ARG1
's*  
supposed*  
to  
be*  
quite  >ARGM-ADV
faster*  
!  

Basically  >ARGM-ADV
Nook  
Tablet  
it  >ARG0
has*  
more  
memory  <ARG1
,  
better  
battery  
life  
and  
a  
better  
processor  
and  
a  
microphone  
.

How  >ARGM-MNR

a  
new  
fish  
tank  <ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
getting*  
a  
10  
gallon  <ARG1
for  
my  
betta  <ARG4
tomorrow  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
want*  
to  
know*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
properly  >ARGM-MNR
set*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

I  >ARG1
'm*  
still  <ARGM-ADV
a  
beginner  <ARG2
.  

Any  >ARGM-EXT

to  
do*  
and

will  >ARGM-MOD
help*  
.  

Thanks*  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
get*  >ARGM-TMP
the  
tank  <ARG1
make*  
sure*  
you  >ARG0
wash*  
the  
inside  <ARG1
(  
with  
plain  
water  <ARG2
)  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
wash*  
the  
gravel  <ARG1
(  
with  
only  
water  <ARG2
too  <ARGM-ADV
)  
take*  
out  
all  
the  
stuff  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is*  
floating*  
on  
top  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Add*  
only  
silk  
plants  <ARG1
as  
plastic  
ones  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
tear*  
up  
ur  
betta  
s  
delicate

You  >>ARG0
add*  
the  
water  <ARG1
and  
put*  
water  
conditioner  <ARG1
into  
the  
water  <ARG2
.  

Start*  
up  
your

(  
sponge  
filters  >ARG1
are*  
the  
best  <ARG2
for  
bettas  <ARGM-GOL

set*  
it  <ARG1
to  
anywhere  <ARG2
between  
78

82

Wait*  
about  
2  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
or  
3  
and  
test*  
your  
water  <ARG1
.  

If  
everything  >>ARG1
is*  
looking*  >>ARGM-ADV
good*  
you  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
add*  
you  
betta  <ARG1
to  
its  
new

Lights  >ARG1
are*  
optinal  <ARG2
since  
fish  >ARG0
need*  
the  
light  >ARG1
turn*  
off  
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
anyways  <ARGM-ADV
and  
an  
air  
pump  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
nessasary  <ARG2
since  
they  >ARG0
get*  
air  <ARG1
from  
the  
surface  <ARG2
.  

ask*  
the  
people  >ARG0
selling*  
you  <ARG2
the  
fish  <ARG1
how  >ARGM-MNR
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
set*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
,  
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
know*  

Add*  
aquasafe  <ARG1
with  
the  
water  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
put*  
in  
it  <ARG2

Make*  
sure*  
the  
temperature  >>ARG1
is*  
good*

Do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
put*  
your  
fish  
tank  <ARG1
close  <ARG2
to  
the  
sun  
or  
algae  >ARG1
grow*  
in  
your  
tank  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Everything  >>ARG1
else  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
good*  
.  

Make*  
sure*  
if  
you  >ARG0
get*  
new  
fish  <ARG1
that  
they  >ARG1

along  
with

Is*  
it  <ARG1
possible*  
to  
shoot*

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
learn*  
how  <ARG1

I  >ARG0
see*  
you  >>ARG1
re*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
recovering*  
from  
the

You  >>ARG1
appear*  
to

feeling*  
better*  
though  <ARGM-ADV

That  >>ARG1
's*  
good*

Know*  
that  
there  
are*  
pros  <ARG1
and  
cons  
to  
laser  
sights  
before  
you  >ARG0
mount*  
them  <ARG1
on  
your  
wang  <ARGM-LOC
.  

While  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
accurate*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
laser  
sights  >>ARG1
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
operate*  
well  <ARGM-MNR
when  
drunk  <ARGM-TMP
or  
high  
because  
the  
beam  >>ARG1
often  >>ARGM-TMP
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
show*  
up  
on  
the  
target  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Therefore  >ARGM-ADV
,  
you  >>ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
learn*  
to  
shoot*  
manually  <ARGM-MNR
.  

2  

Mount*  
laser  
sights  <ARG1
on  <ARGM-PRD
away  <ARGM-ADV
by  
removing*  
the  
hand  
grip  <ARG1
.  

Laser  
grips  >>ARG1
are*  
the  
most  >ARGM-EXT
common*  
for  
wangs  <ARG2
.  

The  
laser  >>ARG0
is*  
made*  
into  
the  
hand  
grip  <ARGM-DIR
and  
has*  
a  
switch*  
on  
the  
side  <ARGM-LOC
to  
turn*  
it  <ARG1
on  <C-V
.  

Remove*  
your  
fingers  <ARG1
from  
the  
existing  
grip  <ARG2
and  
replace*  
them  <ARG1
with  
your  
new  
laser  
grip  <ARG2
.  

You  >ARG0
have*  
two  
adjustment  
screws  <ARG1
for  
up  
and  
down  
and  
right  
to  
left  
positions  
.  

3  

Consider*  
these  
points  <ARG1
for  
mounting*  
laser  
sights  <ARG1
on  
semi-automatic  
wangs  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Newer  
semi-automatic  
wangs  >ARG0
have*  
a  
rail  >ARG1
built*  
into  
the  
receiver  <ARG2
under  
the  
shaft  <ARGM-LOC
.  

This  
rail  >>ARG1
is*  
used*  
for  
multi  
purposes  <ARG2
,  
such  
as  
laser  
devices  
or  
flashlight  
devices  
.  

4  

Prepare*  
to  
mount*  
the  
laser  
sight  <ARG1
onto  
the  
rail  <ARGM-LOC
on  
the  
wang  
.  

You  >ARG0
have*  
two  
screws  >ARG3
that  >R-ARG3
attach*  
the  
sight  <ARG1
to  
the  
wang  <ARG2
.  

Tighten*  
these  
screws  <ARG1
securely  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Flip*  
the  
switch*  
and  
adjust*  
your  
laser  
sight  <ARG1
according  
to  
the  
directions*  
in  
the  
owner  
manual  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
comes*  
with  
the  
laser  
sight  <ARGM-COM

3  
weeks  
old  
baby  
budgie  
alone  
at  
night  
?  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
3  
week  
old  
baby  
budgie  <ARG1
and  
I  >ARG0
noticed*  
that  
his  
/  
her  
mother  >>ARG1
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
stay*  
with  
him  <ARGM-COM
in  
the  
nest  <ARG3
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
mention*  
that  
i  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
separated*  
the  
father  <ARG1
into  
another  
cage  <ARGM-GOL
close  
to  
the  
'  
nest  
cage  
'  
because  
he  >>ARG0
and  
the  
mother  
were*  
fighting*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
was*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
eager*  
to  
go*  
in  
the  
nest  <ARG4
and  
feed*  
the  
baby  <ARG2
and  
she  >>ARG0
always  >>ARGM-TMP
would  >>ARGM-MOD
go*  
right  
away  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
nest  <ARG4
after  
him  <ARGM-TMP
and  
give*  >ARGM-LVB
him  >ARG1
a  
fight*  
right  
there  >ARG2
,  
were  >R-ARG2
the  
baby  >ARG1
was*  
too  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
thought*  
it  >>ARG0
was*  
dangerous*  
for  
the  
baby  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
moved*  
him  <ARG1
.  

She  >ARG0
feeds*  
well  <ARGM-MNR
the  
baby  <ARG2
on  
her  
own  <ARGM-MNR
,  
the  
baby  >ARG1
is*  
ok  <ARG2
but  
she  >>ARG1
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
in  
the  
nest  <ARG4
to  
stay*  
with  
him  <ARGM-COM
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
...  

What  >ARG2
is*  
the  
problem  <ARG1
?  

Is*  
this  <ARG1
a  
transitional  
period  <ARG2
for  
the  
baby  
...  
that  
he  >>ARG1
/  
she  
is*  
left*  
alone*  
much  
more  
time  <<ARGM-TMP
?  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
say*  
that  
the  
baby  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
scream*  
after  
her  <ARGM-ADV
of  
anything  
...  
he  >ARG0
/  
she  
sleeps*  
.  

Budgies  >ARG1
are*  
breast  
feeding  
birds  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
male  >>ARG1
is*  
bisexual*  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
the  
male  >ARG0
gets*  
his  
titts  <ARG1
out  <ARG2
the  
female  >>ARG0
gets*  
mad*  
with  
him  <ARG0
knowing*  
he  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
produce*  
milk  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
fine*  
-  
just  >ARGM-ADV
make*  
sure*  
that  
the  
room  >>ARG1
the  
cage  >ARG1
is*  
in  <C-ARG2
is*  
kept*  
warm*  
.  

If  
the  
baby  >ARG1
is*  
feathered  >>ARGM-ADV
yet  <ARGM-TMP
-  
which  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
sure*  
he  >ARG1
is*  
mostly  <ARGM-EXT
-  
he  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
fine*  
.  

Just  >>ARG0
remember*  
to  
make*  
sure*  
the  
mother  >>ARG0
is*  
properly  >ARGM-MNR
caring*  
for  
the  
baby  <ARG1
.  

Ignore*  
the  
answer*  
above  
me  <ARGM-LOC
,  
btw  <<ARGM-ADV
!  
^_^  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
text*  
from  
Canada  <ARGM-DIR
to  
the  
united  
states  <ARGM-DIR
?  

Ok  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG1
is*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
the  
right  
question  <ARG2
,  
but  
my  
question  >ARG1
is*  
can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
text*  
from  
a  
united  
states  
number  <ARGM-DIR
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
r*  
in  
canada  <ARG2
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
send*  
texts  <ARG1
to  
another  
united  
states  
number  <ARG2
?  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
do*  
you  >>ARG2
get*  
charged*  
for  
it  <ARG3
?  

I  >>ARG1
m*  
sorry*  
if  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
say*  
the  
question  <ARG1
right  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
hope*  
somebody  >ARG0
understands*  
what  >ARG2
I  >ARG0
mean*  

In  
short  
Yes  
.  

However  
not  
in  
all  
cases  
.  

If  
your  
(  
US  
)  
provider  >>ARG0
has*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
deal*  
with  
a  
canadian  
wireless  
company  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
texts  >>ARG1
and  
calls*  
will  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
through  
.  

They  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
,  
however  >ARGM-ADV
,  
cost*  
a  
bunch  <ARG2
.  

The  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  >>ARG1
to  
know*  
for  
sure  <ARGM-EXT
is*  
to  
call*  
611  <ARG1
,  
or  
your  
cell  
phone  
help  
line  
,  
and  
ask*  
.  

The  
phones  >>ARG1
and  
networks  
are*  
compatible*  
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
only  
reason  >>ARG1
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
work*  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
if  
you  >ARG0
have*  
,  
say  <ARGM-DIS
,  
a  
cheap  
cell  
phone  
company  <ARG1
..  

Yes  
you  
can  
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
cost*  
you  <ARG3
lots  <ARG2
of  
money  
unless  
you  >ARG0
have*  
an  
international  >ARGM-ADJ
plan*  
.  

Ye$  >ARGM-DIS
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
Text*  
in  
CANADA  <ARGM-LOC
to  
the  
U$  <ARGM-GOL

a

It  >ARG1

You  >>ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
want*  
to  
get*  
a  
temporary  
phone  <ARG1
for  
your  >ARG0
trip*  
to  
Canada  <ARG1
.  

Is*  
there  
any  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  >ARGM-MNR
to  
communicate*  
or  
do*  
your  
friends  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
understand*  
text  <ARG1
.  

Email*  >ARG1
usually  >ARGM-TMP
free*  
if  
you  >ARG0
use*  
a  
WiFi  >ARG3
connection*  
.  

$ometime$  >>ARGM-TMP
it  
is*  
hard*  
to  
explain*  
that  
you  >>ARG0

I  >ARG0
need*  
HELP*  
with  
my  
Syrian  
Hamster  <ARG1
!!!?  

Hi  >ARGM-DIS
,  
i  >>ARG0
bought*  
my  
Syrian  
Hamster  <ARG1
(  
Fernando  
)  
just  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
and  
as  
i  
was*  
told*  
to  
leave*  

him  
to  
get*  
to  
know*  
his  
new  
home  <ARG1
.  

As  
i  >ARG0
asked*  >>ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
previous  
questions  <ARG1
he  >>ARG0
was*  
jumping*  
up*  
the  
sides  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
cage  
but  
i  >>ARG2
was*  
told*  
is*  
just  
becouse  
he  >>ARG1
is*  
panicking*  
and  
he  >>ARG0
wants*  
to  
escape*  
but  
he  >ARG1
is*  
ok  <ARG2
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
now  >ARGM-TMP
i  >>ARG0
wanted*  
to  
bouild*  
up  
relationship*  
with  
him  <ARG2
so  
i  >ARG0
got*  
a  
piece  <ARG1
of  
carrot  
and  
i  >ARG0
put*  
it  <ARG1
on  
my  
hand  <ARG2
,  
i  >ARG1
moved*  
very  
slowly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
he  >ARG0
suddenly  >ARGM-TMP
run*  
away  <ARGM-DIR
to  
his  
tube  <ARGM-DIR
.  

Why  
,  
how  >ARGM-MNR
can  >ARGM-MOD
i  >ARG0
build*  
up  
realtion  
ship  <ARG1
with  
him  
he  >>ARG0
is*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG
useing*  
the  
thing  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
he  >ARG0
runs*  
on  <C-ARG1
and  
he  >>ARG0
wakes*  
up  
walks*  
around  <ARGM-DIR
and  
goes*  
to  
sleep*  
again  <<ARGM-TMP
???  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
help*  
i  >>ARG1
m*  
worried*  
about  
him  <ARG0
!!!  

Thanks*  
.  

CHILL*  
OUT  
!  

Firstly  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
your  
hammie  >>ARG1
was*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
stressed*  
out  
,  
he  >ARG0
wanted*  
attention*  
.  

Secondly  >ARGM-TMP
,  
that  >ARG1
is*  
normal  
behavior  <ARG2
as  
they  >ARG0
use*  
the  
wheels  <ARG1
in  
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Thirdly  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
just  >>ARGM-DIS
put*  
your  
hand  <ARG1
in  
his  
cge  <ARG2
ans  
leave*  
it  <ARG1
their  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
willl  >>ARGM-MOD
eventually  >>ARGM-TMP
come*  
and  
explore*  
it  <ARG1
and  
them  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
handle*  
him  <ARG1
a  
little  
bit  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Hope*  
I  >ARG0
helped*  
!  

Give*  
him  <ARG2
time  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
got*  
him  <ARG1
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >>ARG0
's*  
probably  >>ARGM-ADV
still  >>ARGM-TMP
scared*  
and  
unsure*  
.  

Once  
he  >>ARG1
has*  
properly  >>ARGM-MNR
settled*  >>ARGM-TMP
down  
,  
got*  
use  <ARG2
to  
the  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
smells*  
and  
noises  
he  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
fine*  
.  

Once  
he  >ARG1
is*  
more  
comfy  >ARGM-TMP
with  
his  
surroundings  
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
start*  
handling*  
him  <ARG1
and  
getting*  
to  
know*  
each  
other  <ARG1
more  <ARGM-EXT
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
just  >ARGM-ADV
give*  
him  <ARG2
time  <ARG1
for  
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Is*  
Fujairah  <ARG1
a  
nice  
place  >ARGM-LOC
to  
live*  
in  <C-ARGM-LOC
?  

My  
family  >>ARG1
and  
I  
are*  
planning*  
to  
shift*  
to  
Fujairah  <ARG2
in  
a  
couple  <ARGM-TMP
of  
years  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
needed*  
to  
know*  
if  
it  >ARG1
is*  
a  
suitable  
place  >ARGM-LOC
to  
live*  
in  <C-ARGM-LOC
and  
in  
what  
ways*  
.  

Also  
that  
,  
I  >ARG0
heard*  
in  
the  
next  
few  
years  >>ARGM-TMP
Fujairah  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
as  >ARGM-CXN
good*  
as  
Dubai  <C-ARGM-CXN
,  
is*  
it  >ARG1
true*  
?  

I  >>ARG1
'd  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
happy*  
if  
someone  >ARG0
helps*  
,  
especially  
someone  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
has*  
been*  
to  
Fujairah  <ARG2
or  
lives*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  
:)  

I  >ARG0
LIVE*  
THERE  <ARGM-LOC
!  

...  
I  >>ARG0
ve*  
been*  
living*  
in  
Fujairah  <ARGM-LOC
my  
entire  
life  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
that  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
developing*  
in  
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
2012  >>ARG1
is*  
going*  
to  
be*  
a  
great  
year  <ARG2
for  
Fujairah  
as  
we  >ARG0
have*  
A  
LOT  <ARG1
of  
projects  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
done*  
by  
2012  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Things  >ARG1
to  
do*  
in  
Fujairah  
..  

It  >ARG1
s*  
between  
sea  <ARG2
and  
mountains  
so  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
camp*  
on  
beach  <ARG1
or  
between  
mountains  
!  

...  
Fishing*  >>ARG1
,  
Jet  
skies  
,  
snorkeling*  
,  
diving*  
are*  
some  <ARG2
of  
the  
things  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
for  
fun*  
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
now  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
are*  
finishing*  
a  
road  <ARG1
between  
Fujairah  
and  
Dubai  
in  
45  
minutes  
only  
!  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
no  >>ARGM-DIS
it  >>ARG1
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
as  >ARGM-CXN
good*  
as  
Dubai  <C-ARGM-CXN
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
s*  
quieter*  
and  
more  
peaceful  
,  
and  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
go*  
to  
Dubai  <ARG4
in  
45  
mins  <ARGM-TMP
.  

please  >ARGM-DIS
let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
if  
you  >ARG0
need*  
anything  <ARG1
else  

Visited*  
Fujairah  <ARG1
when  
in  
Dubai  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Nothing  
like  
Dubai  
,  
and  
never  >ARGM-NEG
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
!  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
the  
economics  <ARG1
of  
Fujairah  
but  
Dubai  >ARG1
is*  
basically  <ARGM-ADV
bankrupt  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
end*  
up  
like  
them  <ARG2
!  

Unless  
you  >>ARG0
have*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
particular  
skill  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
need*  
-  
and  
firm  >ARGM-ADJ
job  >ARG1
offer*  
before  
going*  
-  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
think*  
twice  <ARGM-TMP
about  
it  <ARG2
!  

Are*  
there  
any  
new  
Gaming  
console  <ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
should  >ARGM-MOD
i  >ARG0
buy*  
PS3  <ARG1
or  
X  
-  
BOX  
Kinect  
.  

Or  
even  
N  
-  
DS  
or  
PSP  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
afraid*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
buy*  >ARGM-TMP
PS3  <ARG1
or  
X  
-  
BOX  
then  >ARGM-TMP
a  
newer  
version  >ARG1
comes*  
out  
.  

(  
Same  
for  
N  
-  
DS  
and  
PSP  
)  

Wii  
U  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
announced*  
as  
well  
as  
the  
PS4  <C-ARG1
however  >ARGM-ADV
the  
PS4  >ARG1
is*  
only  <ARGM-ADV
in  
development*  
while  
the  
Wii  
U  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
out  <ARG2
next  
year  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Microsoft  >>ARG0
has*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
announced*  
there  
new  
console  <ARG1
yet  <ARGM-TMP
though  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
believed*  
to  
be*  
in  
the  
works*  
.  

No  
matter  >>ARGM-ADV
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
buy*  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
a  
newer  
version  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
feel*  
X  
-  
BOX  >ARG1
is*  
a  
very  
smooth  
system  <ARG2
i  >ARG0
own*  
it  <ARG1
like  <ARGM-DIS
3  
years  <ARGM-TMP
,  
it  >>ARG1
s*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
compatible*  
to  
previous  
versions  <ARG2
and  
mostly  
important  >ARGM-ADV
i  >ARG1
was*  
very  
comfortable  <ARG2
with  
the  
User  
Interface  
and  
the  
JOYSTICK  
....  
coz  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
wan*  
a  
hold*  
a  
joystick  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
gives*  
you  <ARG2
discomfort  <ARG1
.  

XBOX  
Joys  >ARG1
are*  
soo  
comfyy  <ARG2
.....  

Performance*  
-  
You  >ARG0
get*  
the  
same  <ARG1
in  
all  
,  
just  >ARGM-ADV
get*  
a  
good  
TV  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
about  
the  
playstation  
situation  <ARG1
but  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
know*  
that  
Microsoft  >>ARG0
has*  
said*  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see*  
the  
Xbox  <ARG1
360  
as  
being*  
even  
halfway  
through  
its  
lifetime  <ARG2
.  

Since  
they  >ARG0
released*  >ARGM-TMP
kinect  <ARG1
this  >ARG1
was*  
kind  <ARGM-EXT
of  
their  >ARG0
way*  
of  
releasing*  
a  
new  
Xbox  <ARG1
so  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
plan*  
on  
making*  
another  
one  <ARG1
for  
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
know*  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
announced*  
a  
new  
wii  <ARG1
though  <ARGM-ADV
and  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
what  >>ARG1
Sony  >>ARG0
has*  
said*  
about  
playstation  <ARG3
but  
again  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
get*  >>ARGM-ADV
an  
Xbox  >>ARG1
(  
which  >>R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
personally  >ARGM-ADV
think*  
is*  
the  
best  <ARG2
anyways  <ARGM-ADV
)  
you  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
set*  
for  
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
.  

What  >ARG2
is*  
the  
typical  
lifespan  <ARG1
of  
a  
cat  
?  

My  
cat  >>ARG1
had*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
seizure*  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
and  
was*  
ill*  
.  

In  
fact  
every  
once  
in  
a  
while  
he  >>ARG1
seems*  
to  
get*  
ill*  
in  
one  
way*  
or  
another  
;  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG1
bounces*  
back  
like  
nothing  >>ARG1
has*  
happened*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
did*  
an  
internet  >ARG1
search*  
to  
ascertain*  
how  
long  >ARGM-EXT
cats  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
live*  
,  
however  >ARGM-ADV
different  
sources  >ARG0
give*  
wildly  
different  
lifespans  <ARG1
.  

My  
cat  >>ARG1
is*  
18  
years  >ARG2
old*  
.  

In  
your  >ARG0
experience*  
how  
long  >>ARGM-EXT
do*  
cats  
do*  
cats  >ARG0
typically  >ARGM-ADV
live*  
?  

Is*  
he  <ARG1
on  
his  
last  
legs  <ARG2
or  
is*  
it  <ARG1
conceivable  <ARG2
that  
he  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
around  <ARG2
for  
another  
15  
years  <ARGM-TMP
as  
is*  
claimed*  
by  
some  <ARG0
of  
the  
sources  >>ARG1
i  >>ARG0
ve*  
been*  
looking*  
at  <C-ARG1
?  

from  
my  >ARG0
experience*  
with  
my  
cats  <ARG1
13  
-  
18  
years  
depending  
on  
the  
breed  
.  

At  
18  
years  
,  
your  
cat  
has*  
had  
a  
long  
life  
.  

Indoor  
cats  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
are*  
well  >ARGM-MNR
cared*  
for  <ARG1
typically  >ARGM-ADV
live*  
11  
-  
15  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Older  
males  >>ARG1
often  >ARGM-TMP
tend*  
to  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
urinary  
tract  >ARG0
issues*  
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
your  
cat  >>ARG0
has*  
done*  
very  
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Male  
cats  >ARG0
very  
seldom  >ARGM-TMP
live*  
past  
14  
-  
15  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Stories  >>ARG1
of  
cats  >ARG0
living*  
more  
than  
25  
years  <ARGM-TMP
are*  
rare*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
ve*  
had*  
cats  <ARG1
for  
35  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
the  
oldest  
cat  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
've*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had*  
was*  
a  
23  
year  
old  
female  <ARG2
and  
she  >ARG1
was*  
exceptional  <ARG2
.  

By  
comparison*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
outdoor  
cats  >ARG0
have*  
a  
life  
expectancy  <ARG1
of  
3  
-  
7  
years  
depending  
on  
how  
many  
predators  >ARG1
are*  
in  
the  
local  
environment  <ARG2
.  

According  
to  
a  
couple  
sources  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
world  
record  >ARG1
for  
the  
oldest  
cat  
was*  
a  
cat  >ARG0
in  
Devon  
,  
England  
who  >R-ARG0
reportedly  >ARGM-ADV
live*  
to  
the  
age  <ARGM-TMP
of  
36  
.  

I  >ARG0
knew*  
a  
cat  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
died*  
in  
its  
sleep  <ARGM-MNR
aged*  
21  <ARG2
.  

Anything  >ARG1
after  
12  
is*  
a  
bonus  <ARG2
.  

Gaining*  
and  
loosing*  
my  
cockatiel  
's  
trust  <ARG1
...  
?  

I  >ARG0
thought*  
that  
I  >>ARG0
had*  
gained*  
my  
cockatiel  
's  
trust  <ARG1
,  
but  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG1
's*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
coming*  
to  
me  <ARG4
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
open*  
his  
cage  <ARG1
.  

What  >>ARG1
do*  
I  >ARG0
do*  
?  

Did*  
anything  >ARG1
happen*  
before  
losing*  
his  
trust  <ARG1
?  

Birds  >>ARG1
are*  
hard*  
to  
gain*  
trust  <ARG1
with  
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
lost*  
so  
easily  <ARGM-MNR
!  

A  
simple  >ARGM-ADJ
hand  >ARGM-MNR
gesture*  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
resorted*  
to  
him  >>ARG0
being*  
afraid*  
of  
you  <ARG1
.  

Eating*  >>ARG1
by  
his  
cage  <ARGM-LOC
and  
keeping*  
a  
"  
sleep  
cage  <ARG1
"  
in  
your  
room  <ARGM-LOC
is*  
a  
good  
idea  <ARG2
.  

Birds  >>ARG0
eat*  
and  
sleep*  
with  
their  
flock  <ARGM-COM
,  
not  
predators  
.  

Keep*  
his  
cage  >ARG1
open*  
and  
go*  
on  
your  
computer  <ARG2
,  
or  
read*  
a  
book  <ARG1
,  
etc  
and  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
he  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
come*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
to  
you  <ARG4
.  

Let*  
him  >ARG0
go*  
at  
his  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-ADJ
pace*  
,  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
rush*  
with  
him  <ARG1
,  
and  
never  >ARGM-NEG
ever  
resort*  
to  
physical  
violence  <ARG1
with  
your  
bird  <ARGM-MNR
.  

This  >ARG0
with  >ARGM-MOD
ruin*  
your  >ARG1
bond*  
,  
and  
you  >ARG0
probably  >ARGM-ADV
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
another  
chance*  
to  
build*  
one  <ARG1
.  

Patience  >ARG1
is*  
the  
key  <ARG2
.  
=)  

he  >ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
a  
cuddly  
,  
loving  
,  
tame  
bird  <ARG2
,  
but  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
have*  
a  
friendly  >ARGM-MNR
bond*  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
then  
again  >ARGM-ADV
he  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
!  

dat  
bird  >>ARG1
is*  
smart*  
.  

like  
my  
dogs  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
like*  
me  <ARG1
and  
trust*  
me  <ARG1
,  
but  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
open*  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
door  <ARG1
to  
get*  
them  <ARG1
outside  <ARG2
,  
they  >ARG0
run*  
from  
me  <ARGM-DIR
,  
they  >ARG0
know*  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
going*  
to  
take*  
them  <ARG1
outside  <ARG3
and  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like*  
it  <ARG1
.  

the  
bird  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
know*  
that  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
open*  >ARGM-TMP
the  
cage  
door  <ARG1
it  >ARG1
means*  
that  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
put*  
him  <ARG1
in  
the  
cage  <ARG2
,  
and  
birds  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
usually  >ARGM-ADV
like*  
cages  <ARG1
.  

so  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
the  
bird  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
trust*  
you  <ARG1
,  
but  
still  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like*  
the  
cage  <ARG1
.  

How  >ARGM-MNR
to  
make*  
a  
breyer  
horse  
stable  <ARG1
?  

Hi  >ARGM-DIS
i  >ARG1
m*  
a  
big  
fan  <ARG2
of  
breyer  
horses  
!  

My  
breyers  >ARG0
need*  
stables  <ARG1
or  
barns  
though  <ARGM-ADV
.....  
and  
I  >ARG0
need*  
directions*  
and  
materials  
on  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
make*  
them  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
maybe  
5  
stalls  <ARG1
per  
barn  
so  >ARGM-ADV
make*  
sure*  
the  
stalls  >>ARG1
are*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
that  >ARGM-CXN
big*  
so  
it  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
fit*  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
know*  
where  >ARG2
to  
buy*  
the  
materials  <ARG1
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
make*  
this  >ARG1
as  >ARGM-CXN
simple*  
as  
you  
can  <C-ARGM-CXN
for  
my  
dad  >ARG0
does*  
nt  <ARGM-NEG
really  <ARGM-ADV
not  
that  
good  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Pictures  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
help*  
!  

NOTE  
:  
If  
i  >ARG0
see*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
answer*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
i  >ARG0
love*  
i  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD

How  >ARGM-MNR
can  >ARGM-MOD
i  >ARG0
get*  
my  
kitten  >>ARG0
to  
stop*  
biting*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
plays*  
?  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
kitten  >ARG1
who  >R-ARG1
just  >ARGM-TMP
turned*  
3  
months  <ARG2
today  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >ARG1
's*  
a  
good  
kitty  <ARG2
,  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
plays*  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
bites*  
REALLY  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Almost  
every  
day  >ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
even  >ARGM-ADV
wake*  
me  <ARG1
up  <C-V
like  
5  
am  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
morning  
,  
trying*  
to  
bite*  
my  
arm  <ARG1
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
move*  >ARGM-TMP
it  <ARG1
I  >ARG0
guess*  
he  >ARG0
figures*  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
playing*  
.  
x.x  

I  >ARG0
read*  
somewhere  <ARGM-LOC
that  
you  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
hold*  
his  
mouth  <ARG1
together  <ARGM-ADV
,  
and  
keep*  
it  <ARG1
that  
way  <ARG2
til  
he  >ARG1
panics*  
.  

That  >>ARG1
seems*  
cruel*  
to  
me  <<ARG2
though  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

Any  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  
??  

Do*  
you  >ARG0
think*  
he  >>ARG0
's*  
teething*  
?  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
getting*  
out  
of  
hand  <ARG2
.  

Yeah  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
thought*  
that  
the  
holding*  
his  
mouth  <ARG1
thing  >>ARG2
sounded*  
wrong*  
.  

No  
worries  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
i  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
try*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
does*  
have*  
toys  <ARG1
,  
a  
scratching  
post  
,  
LOTS  
of  
mice  
,  
balls  
,  
yarn  
,  
a  
feathery  
birdy  
toy  
,  
etc  
.  

He  >>ARG0
'd  >>ARGM-MOD
just  >>ARGM-ADV
randomly  >>ARGM-MNR
walk*  
up  
to  
you  <ARG2
and  
start*  
the  
biting*  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
put*  >ARGM-TMP
him  <ARG1
off  
of  
my  
bed  <ARG2
,  
he  >ARG0
jumps*  
back  
on  <ARGM-DIR
and  
same  
thing  
.  

he  >>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
teething*  
but  
i  >>ARG0
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
it  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
stopped*  
.  

maybe  >ARGM-ADV
buy*  
him  <ARG4
toys  >>ARG0
that  >R-ARG2
he  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
play*  
with  <C-ARG2
that  >R-ARG0
give*  
him  <ARG2
a  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
to  
use*  
his  
energy  <ARG1
up  <C-V

yes  >>ARGM-DIS
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
hold*  
any  
animal  
s  
mouth  <ARG1
shut  <ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG0
wil  >ARGM-MOD
close*  
their  >ARGM-GOL
air  >ARG0
way*  
,  
he  >ARG1
s*  
just  
a  
kitty  <ARG2
and  
they  >ARG1
are*  
very  
rambunctious  <ARG2
,  
get*  
him  <ARG4
toys  <ARG1
.  

lots  
of  
them  
,  
feather  
ones  >ARG1
work*  
best  <ARGM-ADV
,  
also  >>ARGM-ADV
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
bites*  >ARGM-TMP
you  <ARG1
in  
the  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
put*  
him  >ARG0
down  <ARGM-DIR
off  
your  
bed  <ARG2
,  
to  
show*  
him  <ARG2
that  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
tolerate*  
that  <ARG1
,  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
it  <ARG1
,  
he  >>ARG0
s*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
probably  >ARGM-ADV
teething*  
,  
so  
toys  >ARG1
are*  
your  >ARG0
best  >ARGM-ADJ
bet*  

Which  
rat  
cage  >>ARG1
is*  
better*  
?  

Hi  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
get*  
a  
few  
pet  
rats  <ARG1
and  
need*  
a  
rat  
cage  <ARG1
.  

(  
Apart  
from  
the  
wire  
flooring  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
i  >>ARG0
am*  
going*  
to  
cover*  
)  
Which  >>ARG1
of  
these  
two  
cages  
is*  
better*  
:  

http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_2079wt_893

I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
decide*  
between  
height  <ARG1
or  
width  
.  

http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_  

This  
one  >>ARG1
is*  
better*  
for  
rats  <ARG2
.  

You  >>ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
want*  
to  
go*  
higher  <ARG1
rather  
than  
wider  
for  
rats  <<ARG2
.  

They  >>ARG0
LOVE*  
to  
climb*  
.  

You  >>ARG0
will  
have*  
to  
cover*  
the  
wire  
flooring  <ARG1
like  
you  >ARG0
said*  
,  
and  
make*  
fleece  
covers  <ARG1
for  
the  
stairs  
,  
so  
no  
ratty  
feet  >>ARG1
get*  
caught*  
and  
broken*  
.  

This  
cage  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
hold*  
about  
2  
-  
3  
rats  <ARG1
.  

Both  >ARG1
are*  
equal  
length  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
go*  
for  
the  
taller  
one  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
use*  >>ARGM-ADV
this  
cage  <ARG1
it  
's*  
best*  
to  
remove*  
the  
wire  
shelves  <ARG1
altogether  <ARGM-EXT
and  
replace*  
it  <ARG1
with  
hammocks  <ARG2
and  
the  
like  
.  

I  >ARG0
used*  
one  <ARG1
of  
these  
cages  
short  
term  <ARGM-TMP
for  
a  
pet  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
was*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
that  >ARGM-EXT
great*  
to  
be*  
honest*  
,  
pretty  
cheaply  >ARGM-MNR
made*  
,  
the  
door  
springs  >>ARG0
are*  
annoying*  
and  
it  >>ARG1
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
last*  
very  
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Here  >ARG2
are*  
some  
better  
options  <ARG1
IMO  <ARGM-DIS

These  >>ARG1
are*  
all  >ARGM-ADV
a  
bit  
more  >ARGM-CXN
expensive*  
than  
your  >ARG0
choice*  
but  
if  
you  >ARG0
ebay  >ARG1
search*  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
names  <ARG2
you  >>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
find*  
one  <ARG1
second  
hand  <ARGM-MNR
...  
better  
paying*  
for  
a  
second  
hand  
one  <ARG3
in  
good  
condition  
than  
a  
poorly  
made  
new  
one  
IMO  
.  

The  
First  
One  >>ARG1
Is*  
much  >ARGM-EXT
Better*  
!  

I  >ARG0
Have*  
This  
Exact  
Cage  >ARG1
,  
Bought*  
From  
The  
Exact  
Ebay  
User  <ARG2
.  

It  >>ARG1
s*  
Really  >ARGM-EXT
Good*  
And  
The  
Rat  
Calculater  >ARG0
Says*  
Is*  
Big*  >ARG2
Enough*  
For  
5  
Rats  <ARG3
,  
But  
I  >ARG0
Would  >ARGM-MOD
Put*  
A  
Maximum  <ARG1
Of  
4  
In  
It  <ARG2
Really  <ARGM-ADV
:)  

is*  
under  
tank  >ARG2
heating*  >>ARG1
or  
side  
tank  >ARG2
heating*  
better*  
for  
a  
corn  
snake  <ARG2
?  

i  >>ARG0
was*  
reading*  
the  
package  <ARG1
for  
a  
tank  
heater  >ARG1
i  >ARG0
bought*  
for  
my  
40  
gallon  
tank  <ARG4
for  
my  
snake  
and  
it  >ARG0
said*  
it  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
put*  
under  
the  
tank  <ARG2
or  
on  
the  
side  
.  

i  >>ARG1
m*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
worried*  
about  
damaging*  
the  
surface  >ARG2
my  
tank  >ARG1
is*  
on  <C-ARG2
because  
i  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
prop*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
off  
the  
surface  <ARGM-DIR
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
.  

from  
my  >ARG0
understanding*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
if  
it  >>ARG1
s*  
heated*  >ARGM-ADV
from  
the  
bottom  <ARGM-DIR
,  
my  
snake  >ARG0
risks*  
burning*  
its  
belly  <ARG1
if  
it  >>ARG1
burrows*  
and  
rests*  
directly  <ARGM-MNR
on  
top  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
glass  
over  
the  
heater  
unless  
i  >>ARG0
buy*  
some  <ARG1
of  
that  
reptile  
carpet  
to  
put*  
under  
the  
substrate  <ARG2
,  
but  
it  >>ARG0
has*  
better  >ARGM-ADJ
heat  >ARG1
distribution*  

if  
it  >ARG1
s*  
from  
the  
side  <ARG2
i  
do*  
nt  
have*  
to  
worry*  
about  
propping*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
,  
but  
the  
snake  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
burn*  
itself  <ARG1
if  
it  >ARG0
slithers*  
along  
the  
side  <ARGM-DIR
of  
the  
tank  
and  
i  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
read*  
that  
it  >>ARG0
does*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
distribute*  
heat  <ARG1
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
?  

what  >ARG2
are*  
your  >ARG0
suggestions*  
and  
opinons  
?  

i  >ARG0
use*  
UTH's  <ARG1
on  
all  <ARG2
of  
my  
burrowing*  
snakes  <ARG0
.  

they  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
move*  
if  
they  >>ARG1
get*  
too  >ARGM-EXT
warm*  
-  
it  >ARG1
's*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
like  
a  
heat  
rock  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
avoid*  
at  
all  
costs  <ARGM-MNR
.  

i  >ARG0
usually  >ARGM-TMP
put*  
my  
own  
natural  
rock  <ARG1
over  
the  
UTH  <ARG2
and  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
perfectly  >ARGM-EXT
fine*  
.  

i  >>ARG0
have*  
over  
40  
corns  <ARG1
,  
kings  
,  
and  
milks  
and  
have*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
had*  
a  
problem  <ARG1
with  
the  
UTH  
system  
.  

on  
the  
side  >ARG1
is*  
a  
waste*  
-  
leave*  
it  <ARG1
on  
the  
bottom  <ARG2
.  

good  
luck  
!  

Bottom  
if  
you  >>ARG1
are*  
worried*  >>ARGM-ADV
about  
the  
snake  >ARG0
burning*  
itself  <ARG1
put*  
something  <ARG1
overt  
it  <ARG2
like  
newspaper  <C-ARG1
...  

I  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
use*  
a  
75  
watt  
basking*  
or  
heat  
bulb  <<ARG1
for  
mine  <<ARG2
and  
he  >>ARG0
seems*  
to  
like*  
it  <ARG1

put*  
the  
heater  <ARG1
on  
the  
snake  <ARG2
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
love*  
it  <ARG1
and  
the  
the  
next  
day  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
dinner  <ARG1

What  >ARG1
are*  
good  
places  >ARGM-LOC
to  
eat*  
brunch  <ARG1
at  <C-ARGM-LOC
?

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
strongly  >ARGM-EXT
suggest*  
"  
The  
Breakfast  
Club  <ARG1
"  
in  
Chicago  
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
definately  >ARGM-ADV
plan*  
on  
a  
great  
meal  <ARG1
with  
reasonable  >ARGM-ADJ
prices*  
.  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
in  
a  
hurry*  
though  <<ARGM-DIS
.  

Just  >>ARGM-ADV
relax*  
and  
enjoy*  
.  

They  >ARG0
have*  
fabulous  
French  
toast  <ARG1
too  <ARGM-DIS
.  

The  
Breakfast  
Club  >>ARG1
&  
Grill  
is*  
conveniently  >ARGM-ADV
located*  
just  
two  
blocks  
off  
the  
Kennedy  
Expressway  <ARGM-LOC
.  

There  
is*  
always  <ARGM-TMP
plenty  <ARG1
of  
parking*  
on  
the

or  
in  
our  
private

Question  
about  
the  
sinking*  
of  
the  
Titanic  <ARG1
?  

After  
the  
sinking*  
of  
the  
Titanic  <ARG1
in  
1912  <ARGM-TMP
,  
was  
there  
a  
law  >ARG1
made*  
so  
that  
ships  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
carry*  
enough  
lifeboats  >ARGM-ADV
to  
save*  
everybody  <ARG1
on  
a  
ship  
if  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
sinking*  
?  

If  
yes  >ARGM-ADV
,  
was  
Canada  >ARG1
involved*  
in  
this  
act  <ARG2
/  
law  
?  

Sorry  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
very  >ARGM-EXT
nervous*  
after  
watching*  
the  
movie  <ARG1
.  

SOLAS  >>ARG1
(  
Safety  
Of  
Life  
At  
Sea  
)  
,  
which  >R-ARG1
is*  
an  
international  
maritime  
treaty  <ARG2
,  
came*  
about  
in  
response*  
to  
the  
tragedy  <ARG1
of  
the  
Titanic  
.  

Today  >ARGM-TMP
,  
it  >ARG1
is*  
the  
primary  
safety  
law  >ARG0
affecting*  
virtually  
all  
ships  <ARG1
,  
regardless  <ARGM-ADV
of  
country  
of  
registration*  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
ever  >ARGM-TMP
go*  >>ARGM-ADV
on  
a  
cruise  
ship  <ARG1
,  
you  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
required*  
to  
attend*  
a  
SOLAS  
muster  
drill  <ARG1
(  
lifeboat  
drill  
)  
within  
24  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
of  
sailing*  
.  

Most  
ships  >ARG0
perform*  
this  
drill  <ARG1
before  
even  >ARGM-ADV
leaving*  
the  
dock  <ARG1
.  

SOLAS  >ARG0
covers*  
just  
about  
every  
aspect  <ARG1
of  
safety  
at  
sea  
,  
including  
minimum  
safety  
equipment  
,  
practices  
,  
and  
standards  
,  
lifeboats  
,  
navigation  
practices  
,  
fire  >ARG2
protection*  
,  
and  
so  
on  
.  

We  >>ARG1
are*  
much  >ARGM-EXT
safer*  
today  <ARGM-TMP
on  <ARGM-LOC
board  
ship  
due  
to  
SOLAS  <ARGM-CAU
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
suppose*  
if  
any  
good  >ARG1
came*  >>ARGM-ADV
out*  
of  
the  
Titanic  
tragedy  <ARG0
,  
the  
adoption*  >ARG1
of  
SOLAS  <ARG1
is*  
probably  <ARGM-ADV
it  <ARG2
.

Edit  
:  
Also  >ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
forgot*  
to  
mention*  
earlier  <ARGM-TMP
,  <<ARG1
most  
(  
if  
not  
all  
)  
cruise  
ships  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
practice*  
lifeboat  
drills  <ARG1
weekly  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
it  
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
uncommon*  
to  
see*  
them  >ARG0
to  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
launch*  
the  
lifeboats  <ARG1
into  
the  
water  <ARGM-DIR
as  
part  <ARGM-ADV
of  
their  
drill  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
are*  
in  
port  <ARG2
.  

This  >>ARG0
not  
only  
ensures*  
the  
lifeboats  >>ARG1
are*  
operational  <ARG2
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
work*  
if  
needed*  
,  
but  
makes*  
the  
crew  >>ARG0
proficient*  
at  
launching*  
them  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
so  <ARG1

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
worry*  
.  

When  
was  
the  
last  
time  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
heard*  
about  
a  
ship  >ARG1
sinking*  
?  

100  
years  
ago  
?  

What  >ARG2
are*  
some  
fun  
things  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
while  
in  
Japan  <ARGM-TMP
?  

I  >ARG1
'll  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
in  
Okinawa  <ARG2
for  
about  
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
was*  
wondering*  
what  >ARG2
are*  
some  
fun  
things  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
?  

I  >ARG1
'm*  
a  
20  
year  
old  
female  >ARG0
travelling*  
by  
myself  <ARGM-MNR
so  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
anything  <ARG2
.  

Besides  
the  
obvious  
tourist  
spots  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
already  >>ARGM-ADV
have*  
planned*  
for  <C-ARG1
.  

How  >ARG2
is*  
the  
night  
life  <ARG1
in  
Naha  
?  

Are*  
there  
any  
good  
venues  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
showcase*  
underground  
bands  <ARG1
,  
or  
just  
a  
venue  
at  
all  
?  

It  >>ARG1
does*  
n't  
have*  
to  
be*  
underground*  
it  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
any  
type  <ARG2
of  
music  
.  

Thanks*  

The  
best  
thing  >>ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
in  
Okinawa  <ARGM-LOC
is*  
to  
go*  
to  
a  
beach  <ARG4
.  

Otherwise  >ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
in  
other  
parts  <ARGM-LOC
or  
Japan  
,  
like  
shopping*  
,  
eating*  
,  
etc  
.  

Or  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
visit*  
temples  <ARG1
or  
shrines  
in  
Okinawa  
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
first  >ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
try*  
speaking*  
Japanese  <ARG1
.  

Go*  
to  
a  
sumo  
tournament  <ARG4
.  

Eat*  
at  
a  
conveyor  
-  
belt  
sushi  
restaurant  <ARGM-LOC

Climb*  
Mount  
Fuji  <ARG1

Okinawa  >>ARG1
is*  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
different*  
from  
the  
rest  <ARG2
of  
Japan  
,  
although  
of  >ARGM-ADV
course  
there  
are*  
similarities  <ARG1
.  

The  
main  
thing  >>ARG1
people  >ARG0
do*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
is*  
go*  
to  
the  
beach  <ARG4
.  

There  
's*  
the  
market  >>ARG1
in  
Naha  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
great*  
.  

You  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
find*  
all  
sorts  <ARG1
of  
fresh  
food  
and  
get*  
a  
really  
delicious  
,  
fresh  
sashimi  
/  
sushi  
lunch  <ARG1
upstairs  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Try*  
the  
local  
sake  <ARG1
too  <ARGM-ADV
if  
you  
can  <ARGM-ADV
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
a  
special  
kind  <ARG2

I  >ARG1
'm*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
sure  <ARG2
that  
there  
's*  
much  
nightlife  <ARG1
in  
Naha  <ARGM-LOC
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
more  <ARG2
of

to  
enjoy*  
the  
weather  <ARG1

the

(

somewhere  <ARGM-LOC

Your  >ARG0
best  >ARGM-ADJ
bet*  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
to  
get*  
a  
copy*  
of  
the  
Lonely

I  >>ARG0
was*  
playing*  
a  
video  
game  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
has*  
a  
m  
16  
Vietnam  
model  <ARG1
,  
and  
in  
the  
game  >ARGM-LOC
it  >ARG1
's*

My

full

My  
questions  
are  
..  

1  
)  
what  >ARG1
the  
s*  
difference*  
between  
a  
modern  
m16  <ARG1
and  
Vietnam  
m  
16  
?  

2  
)  
did*  
Vietnam  
m  
16's  >>ARG0
have*  
a  
3  
-  
shot*  >ARGM-ADJ
burst*  >ARG1
function*  
?  

To  
save*  >ARGM-PRP
money  <ARG1
Robert  >ARG0
McNamara  
ordered*  
that  
the  
ammunition  >>ARG0
for  
the  
new  
M  
-  
16s  >>ARG1
being*  
sent*  
to  
SEA  <ARG2
in  
the  
early  
60s  <ARGM-TMP
use*  
an  
older  
(  
dirtier  
)  
type  >ARG1
of  
gunpowder  
meant*  
for  
use*  
with  
the  
M  <ARGM-MNR
-  
14  
.  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
ordered*  
that  
the  
receiver  >ARG0
not  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
a  
(  
I  >ARG0
think*  >ARG2
chrome  <ARG1
)  
coating*  
that  >>ARG0
helped*  
keep*  
the  
gun  <ARG1
from  
jamming*  
.  

Than  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
troops  >>ARG2
being*  
issued*  
the  
weapon  <ARG1
were*  
told*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
self  
-  
cleaning  <ARG2
,  
which  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
was*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
.  

As  
a  
result  >ARGM-ADV
there  
was*  
a  
problem  <ARG1
with  
the  
weapon  >ARG1
jamming*  
.  

Once  
the  
troops  >>ARG0
started*  >>ARGM-TMP
cleaning*  
the  
weapon  <ARG1
properly  <ARGM-MNR
(  
even  
with  
the  
dirtier  
powder  <ARGM-ADV
)  
the  
Vietnam  
era  
M  >>ARG1
-  
16  
turned*  
out  
to  
be*  
a  
good  
weapon  <ARG2
for  
the  
purpose  >>ARG2
it  >>ARG1
was*  
being*  
used*  
for  <C-ARG2
.  

The  
screw  
-  
up  >ARG1
was*  
the  
kind  >>ARG1
of  
things  
you  
have*  
happen*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
have*  
bean

counter  
)  
instead  
of  
soldiers  <<ARG1

the  
military  <ARG2

Today  
's

it  >>ARG0

Rotorua  >>ARG1

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
assuming*  
this  >ARG1
was*  
in  
reference*  
to  
the  
January  >ARGM-TMP
earthquake*  
,  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
worry*  
,  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
deep*  
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
nothing  >>ARG1
was*  
effected*  
:)  

As  
for  
Christchurch  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
yes  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
aftershocks  >>ARG1
are*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
happening*  
,  
but  
these  >>ARG1
are*  
fairly  >ARGM-EXT
small*  
-  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
feel*  
them  <ARG1
,  
but  
the  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
do*  >ARGM-LVB
any  
damage*  
.  

Since  
lots  >>ARG0
of  
people  
are*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
living*  >>ARGM-CAU
there  <ARGM-LOC
,  
then  >>ARGM-ADV
it  >>ARG0
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
fine*  
to  
visit*  
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
the  
CBD  >ARG1
is*  
closed  <ARG2

the

as  
a

is*  
still  <ARGM-TMP
rubble  <ARG2
and  
stuff  
and  
has*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
been*  
cleared*  
away  <ARGM-PRD
yet  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
sure*  
that  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
find*  
some  
hotels  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are*  
running*  
in  
the  
christchurch  
area  <<ARGM-LOC
,  
but  
if  
not  >ARGM-ADV
then  >ARGM-ADV
there  
would  >ARGM-MOD

some  <ARG1

close  
by

Despite  
the  
aftershocks  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
going*  
to  
Christchurch  <ARG4
,  
just  
for  
the  
experience*  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see*  
first  
hand  <ARGM-MNR
how  >>ARGM-MNR
things  >>ARG1

thanks*  

louise  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
it  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
depends*  
on  
your  
riding  
ability  <ARG1
,  
what  
disciplines  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
are*  
interested*  
in  
doing*  
,  
or  
plan*  
on  
doing*  
,  
etc  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
for  
the  
base  
number  <ARG1
of  
15  
hh  
.  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
"  
tall*  
"  
being*  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
bigger*  
than  
a  
pony  <ARGM-CXN
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
's*  
on  
the  
small  
end  <ARG2
for  
a  
horse  <ARGM-PRD
.  

I  >ARG0
got*  
my  
horse  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
was*  
12  <ARG2
and  
I  >ARG1
was*  
already  <ARGM-ADV
5  <ARG2
'  
9  
-  
5  
'  
10  
,  
thankfully  >ARGM-MNR
I  >>ARG1
stopped*  
growing*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
hit*  
5  <ARG1
'  
11  
"  
but  
my  
horse  >ARG1
is*  
about  
16.2  
or  
16.3  
hh  <ARG2
,  
TB  
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
do*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
afraid*  
to  
get*  
something  <ARG1
a  
little  
bigger  
than  
"  
perfect  
"  
just  
in  
case  
you  >ARG0
hit*  
a  
growth  
spurt  <ARG1
.  

A  
taller  
horse  >>ARG1
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
always  >ARGM-TMP
mean*  
a  
horse  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
handle*  
.  

Keep*  
that  <ARG1
in  
mind  <ARG2
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
keep*  
in  
mind  <ARGM-LOC
whether  
you  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
be*  
able*  
to  
jump*  
up  
from  
the  
ground  <ARGM-DIR
,  <<ARG2
if  
you  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
need*  
to  <ARG1
,  
etc  
.  

You  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
want*  
to  
be*  
sure*  
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
groom*  
and  
saddle*  
sufficiently  <ARGM-MNR
and  
the  
horse  >>ARG1
itself  
is*  
calm*  >ARG2
enough*  
so  
that  
whatever  
size  >>ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
is*  
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
handle*  
it  <ARG1
.  

i  >>ARG1
'm*  
5  <ARG2
'  
3  
-  
4  
"  
and  
am*  
21  <ARG2
well  >ARGM-DIS
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
in  
Nov  <ARGM-TMP
and  
my  
horse  >ARG1
is*  
14.2  
hh  <ARG2
and  
she  >ARG1
's*  
perfect  
size  <ARG2
for  
me  <ARGM-GOL
i  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
hop*  
right  
on  <ARGM-ADV
with  
no  
mounting  
block  <ARGM-MNR
.....  
only  
with  
a  
saddle  
though  
haha  
i  
ca  
n't  
bareback  <ARGM-ADV
,  
not  
yet  

If  
you  >>ARG1
Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
grow*  
out  
of  
it  <ARG4

..  

Anything  
smaller  
you  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
grow*  
out  <ARGM-ADV
,  
anything  >>ARG1
bigger  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
too  >>ARGM-EXT
big*  
and  
difficult*  
to  
control*  
and  
manage*  
,  
especially  
when  >ARGM-TMP

Hope*  
I  >ARG0

Where  >ARG2
in  
the  
world  
is*  
Iguazu  <ARG1
?  

Iguazu  
Falls  

Widely  >ARGM-MNR
considered*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
be*  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
most  
spectacular  
waterfalls  
in  
the  
world  
,  
the  
Iguazu  
Falls  >ARG1
on  
the  
border  
of  
Argentina  
and  
Brazil  
,  
are*  
a  
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
must  >ARGM-MOD
see*  >ARGM-ADJ
attraction*  
in  
the  
area  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
centre  >>ARG1
of  
the  
falls  
is*  
known*  
locally  <ARGM-LOC
as  
‘  
Garganta  
Del  
Diablo  >ARGM-LOC
’  
(  
The  
Devil  
’s  
Throat  
)  
,  
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
the  
huge  
volume  >ARG0
of  
water  
sends*  
a  
constant  
mist  <ARG1
of  
spray  
into  
the  
air  <ARGM-DIR
.  

With  
the  
sun  >>ARG0
shinning*  >>ARGM-ADV
down  <ARGM-DIR
on  
the  
spray  <ARG2
,  
creating*  
a  
rainbow  <ARG1
in  
the  
foreground  <ARGM-LOC
,  
this  >ARG1
is*  
the  
perfect  
place  >ARGM-LOC
to  
get*  
that  
trademark  
Iguazu  
Falls  
photograph  <ARG1
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
save*  
some  <ARG1
of  
your  >ARG0
shots*  
for  
the  
rest  <<ARG2
of  
the  
falls  
,  
as  
in  
total  >ARGM-ADV
there  
are*  
around  
270  
cascades  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
spread*  
out  
over  
nearly  
2  
miles  <ARG2
of  
the  
Iguazu  
River  
.  

The  
Iguazu  
Falls  >>ARG0
are*  
easily  >ARGM-ADV
accessible*  
and  <<ARG2
,  <<ARG2
dependent*  
on  
your  
time  >ARG1
restrictions*  
and  
budget  
,  
you  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
to  
the  
area  <ARG2
by  
either  
bus  <ARGM-MNR
or  
plane  
.  

The  
nearest  
towns  >ARG1
to  
the  
site  
are*  
Puerto  <ARG2
Iguazu  
in  
Argentina  
,  
about  
12  
miles  
from  
the  
falls  
,  
and  
Foz  >>ARG1
do  
Iguaçu  
in  
Brazil  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
equally  >ARGM-EXT
close*  
.  

Both  
towns  >ARG0
have*  
airports  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are*  
served*  
regularly  <ARGM-TMP
from  
the  
larger  
cities  <ARG0
such  
as  
Sao  
Paulo  
,  
Rio  
de  
Janeiro  
and  
Buenos  
Aires  
.  

The  
bus  >ARG1
is*  
obviously  <ARGM-ADV
the  
cheaper  
option  <ARG2
,  
and  
travelling*  >>ARGM-ADV
up  <ARG1
from  
Buenos  
Aires  <ARG2
the  
trip*  >ARG1
is*  
a  
full  
20  
hours  <ARG2
,  
although  
the  
buses  >ARG1
are*  
very  
comfortable  <ARG2
with  
spacious  
reclining*  
seats  <ARG1
.  

The  
bus  >ARGM-MNR
trip*  >ARG1
down  <ARG1
from  
Sao  <ARG2
Paulo  
is*  
a  
similar  
affair  >ARG0
taking*  
around  
18  
hours  <ARG1
.  

Foz  >>ARG1
on  
the  
Brazilian  >ARG1
side*  
is*  
the  
larger  
town  <ARG2
,  
however  >>ARGM-ADV
both  >>ARG0
are*  
geared*  
up  
to  
cater*  
for  
visitors  <ARG2
to  
the  
Waterfalls  
and  
National  
Parks  
,  
and  
so  >ARGM-ADV
offer*  
a  
range  <ARG1
of  
accommodation*  
for  
all  
budgets  
.  

For  
those  >ARGM-GOL
with  
a  
larger  
appetite  
for  
the  
scenery  
and  
a  
larger  
budget  
,  
there  
are*  
some  
hotel  
complexes  <ARG1
much  
closer  
to  
the  
action*  
with  
views*  
of  
parts  <ARG1
of  
the  
falls  
.

As

you  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD

much  
more  >ARGM-EXT

in  
London  <ARGM-LOC

Parisians  >ARG0

Americans  >>ARG0
for  
their  >ARG0
lack*  
of  
speaking*  
French  <ARG1
and  
proper

I  >>ARG0

to

You  >>ARG0

However  >>ARGM-ADV

right

It  >>ARG1
's*

and  
the  
people  >>ARG1

I  >>ARG0

it  >ARG1

How  >ARGM-MNR
can  >ARGM-MOD
i  >ARG0

my  
Jack

?  

i  >ARG0

a

how  >ARGM-MNR
to

them  >ARG1

He  >ARG1
's*  
the

,  
you  >>ARG0

trying*  
to  
"  
Make*  
"  
them  >ARG1

.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
like  
trying*  
to

2  
people  >>ARG1
get*  
married*  
.  

It  >>ARG1
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
work*  
.  

First  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
need*  
a  
compatible  
pair  <ARG1
.  

Sounds*  
like  
your  
2  >ARG0
at  
least  >ARGM-ADV
tolerate*  
each  
other  <ARG1
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
there  
is*  
hope*  
there  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

Then  >ARGM-TMP
the  >>ARG1
need*  
to  
be*  
mature*  
,  <<ARG2
that  
is  
,  
old  
enough  
,  
and  
big  
enough  
to  
breed*  
.  

This  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
around  
1

,  
probably  
4

for  
those

.  

Then  
the  
environment  
.  

Large  
tank  
,  
no  
annoying  
tankmates  
,  
perfect  
water  
conditons  
and  
really  
good  >ARGM-ADJ

The  
difference*  >ARG1

what  >ARG1
they  >>ARG0

,  
VS  
what  >>ARG1
's*  
ideal*  
for  
them  <ARG2

Get*  
that  >ARG2
right*  
,  
and  
they  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
mate*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
THEY  >>ARG1
are*  
ready*  
.  

You  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
MAKE*  
them  >ARG1
mate*  
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
encourage*  
them  <ARG1
.  

Ian  

Jack  
Dempseys  >ARG1
are*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
an  
easy  
cichlid  >ARG1
to  
breed*  
.  

Most  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
time  
one  >>ARG1
is*  
more  >ARGM-CXN
interested*  
in  
breeding  <ARG2
than  
the  
other  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

Bredders  >>ARG0
take*  
the  
one  <ARG1
that  >>ARG1
in*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
very  >ARGM-EXT
interested*  
and  
put*  
it  >ARG1
alone*  
in  
a  
breeeding  
tank  <<ARG2
for  
3  
-  
5  
days  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
tank  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
a  
hide  
space  <ARG1
big  
enough  
for  
one  
fish  
,  
or  
a  
few  
of  
them  
,  
but  
at  
least  
1  
cave  
big  
enough  
for  
two  
fish  >ARGM-LOC
to  
fit*  
in  <C-ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
p  
H  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
6.5  <ARG2
-  
7  
.  

Now  >ARGM-DIS
feed*  
the  
one  <ARG2
in  
the  
breeding  
tank  
as  
much  
bloodworms  <ARG1
,  
blackworms  
and  
/  
or  
earthworms  
as  
it  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
eat*  
for  
3  
-  
5  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Then  >ARGM-TMP
add*  
the  
other  
mate  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
respond*  
right  
away  <ARGM-TMP
and  
they  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
fight*  
so  >ARGM-ADV
ther  
smaller  >ARG1
one  
can  >ARGM-MOD
fit*  
in  
one  <ARGM-LOC
of  
hide  
spaces  
if  
it  >>ARG1
gets*  
attacked*  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
the  
male  
s  
aggressive  
behavior  >ARG1
stops*  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
it  >>ARG0
is*  
ready*  
to  
spawn*  
.  

The  
two  >ARG0
lay*  
their  
eggs  <ARG1
inside  
the  
cave  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
made*  
for  
them  <ARG3

Please  >ARGM-DIS
help*  
with  
my  
cat  >ARG1
s  
bladder  >ARG0
issue*  
?  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
1  
1  
/  
2  
year  
old  
female  
calico  <ARG1
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
she  >>ARG1
was*  
spayed*  >ARGM-TMP
the  
vet  >ARG0
had*  
a  
hard  
time  <ARG1
because  
she  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
has*  
one  
uterine  
horn  <ARG1
and  
he  >ARG0
said*  
this  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
mean*  
she  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
has*  
on  
kidney  <ARG1
.  

Recently  >>ARGM-TMP
she  >>ARG0
has*  
been*  
peeing*  
A  
LOT  <ARGM-EXT
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
talking*  
soaking*  
all  
the  
litter  
box  <ARG1
and  
then  
some  
.  

She  >>ARG0
is*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
peeing*  
around  
the  
box  <ARGM-LOC
and  
somehow  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
gets*  
underneath  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
the  
money  <ARG1
to  
take*  
her  <ARG1
to  
a  
vet  <ARG3
right  
now  <ARGM-TMP
but  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
getting*  
to  
be*  
an  
issue*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
scrub*  
the  
floor  <ARG1
2  
-  
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
a  
week  
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

What  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
issue*  
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
try*  
some  
home  
remedies  <ARG1
first  <ARGM-TMP
?  

I  >>ARG0
love*  
her  <ARG1
and  
want*  
to  
help*  
her  <ARG2
but  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
take*  
her  <ARG1
to  
to  
vet  <ARG3
:(  
please  >ARGM-DIS
help*  
.  

First  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
all  
,  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
sorry*  
to  
hear*  
you  >>ARG1
're*  
having*  >ARGM-LVB
this  
issue*  
with  
your  
cat  <ARG0
.  
:(  

Frequent  >ARGM-TMP
urination*  >ARG1
is*  
a  
sign*  
of  
several  
things  <ARG1
.  

Bladder  >ARG1
or  
Urinary  
tract  
infections*  >ARG1
are*  
two  
common  
ones  <ARG2
,  
but  
these  >ARG1
usually  >ARGM-ADV
are*  
frequent  >ARGM-TMP
visits*  
,  
with  
small  
amounts  >>ARG1
of  
urine  
being*  
passed*  
.  

If  
there  
is*  >>ARGM-ADV
blood  <ARG1
in  
the  
urine  <ARGM-LOC
,  
or  
the  
cat  >>ARG1
seems*  
to  
be*  
in  
pain  <ARG2
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG1
is*  
also  <ARGM-DIS
a  
good  
indicator  <ARG2
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
your  
cat  >>ARG0
is*  
passing*  
a  
LOT  <ARG1
of  
urine  
,  
and  
this  >>ARG1
is*  
bad*  
.  

Given  
the  
chance*  >>ARGM-CAU
your  
cat  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
have*  
one  
kidney  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
think*  
the  
worst  
case  
scenario  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
kidney  
disease  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
untreated  >ARGM-ADV
can  >ARGM-MOD
lead*  
to  
possible  
renal  
failure  <ARG2
.  

Signs*  >>ARG1
of  
this  <ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
hard*  
to  
spot*  
,  
and  
if  
this  >>ARG1
is*  
true*  >ARGM-ADV
in  
her  
case  <ARG2
she  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
need*  
to  
see*  
a  
vet  <ARG1
.  

Vomiting*  
,  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
breath*  
,  
and  
listlessness  
.  

Seizures*  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
occur*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
toxins  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
the  
kidney  >ARG0
normally  >ARGM-ADV
filters*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
are*  
released*  
into  
the  
blood  >ARG1
stream*  
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
you  >>ARG1
are*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
worried*  
,  
but  
getting*  >ARG1
her  <ARG1
to  
the  
vet  <ARG2
is*  
the  
best  
thing  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
for  
her  <ARG2
.  

In  
the  
meantime  >ARGM-TMP
make*  
sure*  
she  >ARG0
had*  
plenty  <ARG1
of  
water  
available  
to  
her  
.  

I  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
apply*  
for  
canada  
skilled  >ARGM-PRD
immigeration*  
program  <<ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0

only

Can  >ARGM-MOD

HOWEVER  >ARGM-DIS

The  
pass  >ARG1

could  >ARGM-MOD

.  

You  >ARG0

And  >>ARGM-DIS
between

the

the

Unfortunately  >ARGM-ADV

both

Italian

Have*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
look*  
at

1  
)  
The  
Italian  
Renaissance  >ARG0
began*  
the  
opening  
phase  <ARG1
of  
the  
Renaissance  
,  
a  
period  >>ARG0
of  
great  >>ARGM-ADJ
cultural  >>ARG1
change*  
and  
achievement*  
in  
Europe  <ARGM-LOC
that  >>R-ARG0
spanned*  
the  
period  <ARG1
from  
the  
end*  
of  
the  
13th  
century  <ARG1
to  
about  
1600  
,  
marking*  
the  
transition*  
between  
Medieval  
and  
Early  
Modern  
Europe  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

The  
term  
renaissance  >ARG1
is*  
in  
essence  <ARGM-ADV
a  
modern  
one  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
came*  
into  
currency  <ARG2
in  
the  
19th  
century  <ARGM-TMP
,  
in  
the  
work*  
of  
historians  <ARG0
such  
as  
Jacob  
Burckhardt  
.  

Although  
the  
origins*  >>ARG1
of  
a  
movement*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
was*  
confined*  
largely  <ARGM-ADV
to  
the  
literate  
culture  <ARG2
of  
intellectual  >ARGM-ADJ
endeavor*  
and  
patronage*  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
traced*  >ARGM-ADV
to  
the  
earlier  
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
14th  
century  
,  
many  
aspects  >ARG1
of  
Italian  
culture  
and  
society  
remained*  
largely  <ARG3
Medieval  <ARG3
;  
the  
Renaissance  >>ARG1
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
come*  
into  
full  >ARG2
swing*  
until  
the  
end*  
of  
the  
century  <ARG1
.  

The  
word  >ARG1
renaissance  
(  
Rinascimento  
in  
Italian  
)  
means*  
“  
rebirth  <ARG2
”  
,  
and  
the  
era  >ARG1
is*  
best  
known  <ARG2
for  
the  
renewed  >ARGM-PRD
interest*  
in  
the  
culture  <ARG2
of  
classical  
antiquity  
after  
the  
period  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
Renaissance  
humanists  >ARG0
labelled*  
the  
Dark  
Ages  <ARG2
.  

These  
changes*  >>ARG2
,  
while  
significant  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
were*  
concentrated*  
in  
the  
elite  <ARG1
,  
and  
for  
the  
vast  
majority  >>ARGM-GOL
of  
the  
population*  
life  >>ARG1
was*  
little  >ARGM-ADV
changed*  
from  
the  
Middle  
Ages  <ARG3

The  
expression*  >ARG1
High  
Renaissance  >ARG1
,  
in  
art  
history  
,  
is*  
a  
periodizing  
convention  >>ARG0
used*  
to  
denote*  
the  
apogee  <ARG1
of  
the  
visual  
arts  
in  
the  
Italian  
Renaissance  
.  

The  
High  
Renaissance  
period  >>ARG1
is*  
traditionally  >ARGM-ADV
taken*  
to  
begin*  
in  
the  
1490s  <ARGM-TMP
,  <<ARG2
with  
Leonardo  
s  
fresco  <ARG2
of  
the  
Last  
Supper  
in  
Milan  
and  
the  
death*  
of  
Lorenzo  
de'  
Medici  <ARG1
in  
Florence  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
to  
have*  
ended*  
in  
1527  <ARGM-TMP
with  
the  
sacking  <ARG2
of  
Rome  
by  
the  
troops  
of  
Charles  
V  
.  

This  
term  >>ARG0
was*  
first  >ARGM-TMP
used*  
in  
German  <ARGM-MNR
(  
Hochrenaissance  
)  
in  
the  
early  
nineteenth  
century  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
has*  
its  >ARG1
origins*  
in  
the  
"  
High  
Style  >>ARG1
"  
of  
painting*

described*  
by

Over  
the  
last  
twenty  
years  
,  
use*  
of  
the

has*  
been*  
frequently  
criticized  
by  
academic

historians  
for  
over-simplifying*  
artistic  >ARGM-ADJ

What  >ARG1

the

would

if

them  <ARG1

mine  <ARG2

A  
Sussex  >>ARG0
crossed*

Silkie  <ARGM-COM
would  >ARGM-MOD
make*  
a  
crossbred  
*  
mutt  
*  
chicken  <ARG1

There  
are*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
genetics  
at  
play*  
between  
a  
Sussex  <<ARGM-LOC
and  
Silkie  
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
the  
offspring  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
vary*  
in  
appearance*  
.  

You  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
say*  
what  
color  
Silkie  >>ARG2
or  
Sussex  
you  >>ARG0
are*

so  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG

to  
be*  
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD

.  

Feather

All

Either  
way*  >ARGM-ADV
rec.

dom.  
white  
genes  >ARG0
dilute*  
the  
black  
gene  <ARG1
.  

Skin  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
darker*  
but  
lighter*  
then  
the  
Silkies  <ARGM-CXN
.  

Beards  
/  
Muffs  
:  
If  
your  
Silkie  >ARG0
has*  >ARGM-ADV
a  
beard  
/  
muff  <ARG1
the  
offspring  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
a  
beard  <ARG1
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
,  
as  
these  
genes  >ARG1
are*  
incomplete  
dominate  <ARG2
.  

Feathered  
Feet  
/  
Shanks  
-  
Chicks  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
feathered  
feet  
/  
shanks  <ARG1
as  
this  >ARG1
is*  
also  <ARGM-DIS
incomplete  
dominate  <ARG2
.  

Crest  
:  
Chicks  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
develop*  
a  
small  
crest  <ARG2
due  
to  
this  >ARG1
being*  
another  
incomplete

gene  <ARG2
.  

Comb  
Type  
:  
Silkies  >ARG0
have*  
walnut  
combs  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
is*  
actually  <ARGM-ADV
genetically  <ARGM-ADV
two  
comb  
types  <ARG2
(  
Rose  
and  
Pea  
)  
single  >>ARG1
is*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
there  <ARG2
,  
but  
is*  
recessive  <ARG2
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
crossed*  >ARGM-ADV
to  
a  
Sussex  <ARGM-GOL
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
a  
walnut

,  
rose

or  
single  >ARGM-ADJ
combed*  
bird  <ARG1

Crossed*  >>ARGM-ADV
together  <ARGM-ADV
(  
five  
toes  >ARG1
is*  
incompletely  
dominate  <ARG2
)  
chicks  >>ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
develop*  
to  
have*  
an  
fifth  
toe  <ARG1
on  
both  
,  
or  
even  
one  
foot  
.  

Silkie  
crosses  >ARG1
are*  
great  
birds  <ARG2
,  
and  
very  
neat  
looking  
.  

Hens  >ARG1
make*  
excellent  
mothers  <ARG2
as  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
bigger*  
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD

better  <ARGM-MNR

are*

What  >>ARG1

you  >ARG0

of

?  

The  
lighting  >ARG1
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
best  <ARG2
,  
but  
the  
pics  >ARG1
turned*  
out  
ok  <ARG2
in  
my  
opinion  <ARGM-ADV

deleting*  >>ARG0

i  >ARG0
refer*  
to  
my  >ARG0

you  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
learn*  
about  
white  
balance  <ARG1
,  
composition*  
,  
angle  
,  
and  
work*  
on  
using*  
the

properly  <ARGM-MNR

[  
edit  
-  
and  
she  >>ARG2
most  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
new*  
to  
modeling*  
,  
because  
she  >>ARG0
does*  
look*  
unsure*  
of  
her  
poses  <ARG1
)  

lol  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >>ARG0
has*  
posted*  
this  <ARG1
so  
many  
times  <ARGM-TMP
today  <ARGM-TMP
already  <ARGM-TMP
.  

clearly  >>ARGM-ADV
he  >>ARG1
s*  
mad*  
that  
people  >ARG0
know*  
he  >ARG0
took*  
her  
pic  <ARG1
off  
the  
net  <ARG3
and  
it  >ARG1
's*  
NOT  <ARGM-NEG
his  
gf  <ARG2

Not  
bad  
,  
but  
too  
many  
distracting  
elements  
for  
my  >ARG0
taste*  
.  

For  
example  
:  

In  
the  
photo*  >>ARGM-LOC
on  
the  
couch  <ARGM-LOC
,  
the  
pillow  >>ARG0
she  >>ARG1
is*  
resting*  
on  <C-ARGM-LOC
clashes*  
with  
everything  <ARG1
else  
in  
the  
shot*  
.  

There  
are*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
some  
distracting  
background  
elements  <ARG1
like  
the  
light  
fixture  
and  
what  >ARG0
looks*  
like  
a  
door  
handle  <ARG1
on  
the  
left  
.  

In  
the  
standing  >ARGM-ADJ
photo*  >ARGM-ADV
(  
from  
the  
front  <ARGM-DIR
)  
there  
is*  
a  
corner  >ARG0
of  
a  
rug  
creeping*  
in  <ARG1
,  
some  
kind  
of  
box  
in  
the  
lower  
right  
corner  
and  
what  >ARG0
looks*  
like  
a  
power  
cord  <ARG1
.  

In  
the  
shot*  >>ARGM-LOC
from  
the  
back  <ARG1
,  
the  
crumpled*  
bottom  >>ARG1
of  
the  
curtain  
is*  
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
noticeable*  
as  
well  
as  
the  
power  
outlet  <C-ARG1
.  

Compositionally  >ARGM-PRD
,  
this  
one  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
my  
favorite  <ARG2
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
suggest*  
trying*  
a  
different  
crop  <ARG1
because  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
cutting*  >>ARG1
her  <ARG1
off  <C-V
at  
the  
calf  <ARGM-LOC
looks*  
great*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
like*  
the  
shadow  <ARG1
,  
though  <ARGM-ADV
.  

My  >ARG0
suggestion*  >ARG1
is*  
to  
pay*  >ARGM-LVB
close  >ARGM-ADJ
attention*  
to  
what  >>ARG1
's*  
going*  
on  
in  
the  
background  <ARGM-LOC
and  
if  
possible  >ARGM-ADV
,  
stand*  
on  
a  
chair  <ARG2
,  
get*  
on  
the  
ground  <ARG2
,  
do*  
whatever  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
do*  
to  
get*  
rid*  
of  
distracting  
elements  <ARG1
.  

Using*  >>ARG0
a  
fairly  
wide  
aperture  <ARG1
is*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
helpful*  
in  
blurring*  
out  <ARGM-PRD
unwanted  
background  
elements  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
had*  
a  
few  >ARGM-ADJ
great  >ARGM-ADJ
shots*  >ARG1
ruined*  
myself  <ARGM-REC
because  
there  
was*  
something  >>ARG1
in  
the  
background  
I  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
notice*  
at  
first  <ARGM-TMP
.  

what  >ARG2
are*  
some  
unique  
customs  <ARG1
in  
ireland  
?  

As  
far  >>ARGM-ADV
ask  
I  >>ARG0
’m*  
aware*  
our  
most  
unique  
custom  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
“  
Country  
Wake  <ARG2
”  
.  

In  
all  
my  >ARG0
travels*  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG1
’ve*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
seen*  
anything  <ARG1
like  
it  
and  
am*  
often  >ARGM-TMP
met*  
with  
an  
odd  >ARGM-ADJ
look*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
explain*  
them  <ARG1
to  
foreigners  <ARG2
.  

After  
a  
person  >ARG1
dies*  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
their  
remains  >>ARG1
are*  
“  
waked*  
”  
in  
their  
home  <ARGM-LOC
for  
roughly  
2  
-  
3  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

In  
this  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
visitors  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
come*  
to  
the  
house  <ARG4
,  
pay*  >ARGM-LVB
their  >C-ARG0
respects*  
to  
the  
desisted  <ARG2
and  
their  
family  
and  
have*  
a  
couple  <ARG1
of  
cups  
of  
tea  
with  
a  
sandwich  
or  
a  
bun  
.  

The  
wake  >ARG2
also  >ARGM-DIS
included*  
the  
night  
sit  <ARG1
were  >ARGM-ADV
friends  >ARG1
and  
family  
sit*  
up  
through  
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
with  
the  
remains  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Wakes  >>ARG1
are*  
common*  
both  
north  <ARGM-LOC
and  
south  
of  
the  
boarder  
with  
Protestants  <ARG2
and  
Catholics  
alike  
.  

But  
only  
really  
in  
the  
countryside  
.  

The  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
notable  >ARGM-ADJ
difference*  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
noticed*  
is*  
that  
in  
the  
south  >>ARGM-LOC
of  
Ireland  
one  
night  >>ARG1
of  
the  
wake  
is*  
often  >ARGM-TMP
held*  
in  
the  
chapel  <ARGM-LOC
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
before  
the  
funeral  
,  
this  
tradition  >ARG1
started*  
after  
the  
civil  >ARGM-ADJ
war*  
.  

Another  
unique  
custom  >ARG1
(  
and  
a  
dying  
one  
at  
that  
)  
is*  
the  
Pioneers  <ARG2
.  

The  
Pioneers  >ARG1
was*  
an  
organization  >>ARG0
started*  
at  
the  
end*  
of  
the  
19th  
century  <ARG1
which  >>R-ARG0
pushed*  
and  
supported*  
the  
ideal  <ARG1
of  
temperance  
(  
abstaining*  
from  
alcohol  <ARG1
)  
,  
in  
an  
attempt*  
to  
deal*  
with  
the  
massive  >ARGM-EXT
issue*  >>ARG0
of  
alcoholism  <ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
Ireland  >>ARG1
was*  
gripped*  
by  <C-ARG0
.  

Pioneers  >>ARG0
take*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
pledge*  
to  
remain*  
tee  
-  
total  <ARG3
and  
at  
the  
hight  >ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
organization  
popularity  
,  
had*  
an  
estimated  
two  
million  
members  <ARG1
even  >ARGM-ADV
filling*  
Croke  
Park  <ARG1
on  
the  
25th  >ARG2
anniversary*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
my  
self  
am*  
one  <ARG2
but  
appreciate*  
that  
the  
organization  >>ARG0
is*  
unlikely*  
to  
make*  
into  
the  
22nd  
century  <ARG1
.  

The  
Orange  
Order  >>ARG0
and  
the  
12th  
of  
July  
Marches  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
argued*  
by  
some  <ARG0
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
be*  
an  
Irish  
custom  <ARG2
but  
unarguable  >ARGM-MNR
ticks*  
every  
criteria  >>ARGM-MNR
to  
be*  
considered*  
one  <ARG1
.  

The  
marches  >>ARG1
on  
the  
12th  
of  
July  
are*  
only  >ARGM-ADV
really  >ARGM-ADV
attended*  
by  
protestants  <ARG0
in  
the  
Ulster  
but  
in  
spite  >ARGM-ADV
of  
the  >ARG1
are*  
the  
largest  >ARGM-ADJ
attended*  
paraded  <ARG1
in  
Ireland  
.  

Barn  
brack  
and  
the  
ring  
.  

the  
irish  
customs  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
have*  
in  
our  
family  <ARGM-LOC
are*  
;  
we  >ARG0
make*  
sinnel  
cake  <ARG1
for  
easter  
,  
barn  
brack  <C-ARG1
and  
col  
-  
cannon  
for  
Halloween  
.  

christmas  
cake  
for

.  

Do*  
animals  >ARG0
see*  
images  <ARG1
on  
a  
TV  
screen  <ARGM-LOC
like  
humans  
do*  
?  

Do*  
animals  >ARG0
see*  
images  <ARG1
on  
a  
TV  
screen  <ARGM-LOC
like  
humans  
do*  
?  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
unsure*  
of  
this  <ARG1
,  
because  
once  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
watched*  
a  
commercial  <ARG1
of  
cat  
food  
with  
my  
cat  <ARGM-COM
and  
she  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
react*  
to  
seeing*  
another  
cat  <ARG1
on  
TV  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
heard*  
that  
a  
company  >>ARG0
(  
here  >ARG2
is*  
a  
link  <ARG1
:  
http://news.yahoo.com/nestl-purina-releases-commercial-aimed-dogs-183443091.html  
)  
is*  
trying*  
to  
make*  
a  
dog  
food  
commercial  >ARG1
aimed*  
at  
dogs  <ARG2
,  
complete  <ARGM-ADV
with  
squeaky  >ARG3
chew  
-  
toy  >ARG1
sounds*  
,  
and  
high  
pitched  >ARG3
sounds*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
humans  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hear*  
.  

As  
far  >>ARGM-ADV
as  
I  >ARG0
understand*  
,  
this  
ad  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
dogs  >ARG1
excited*  
,  
but  
my  
question  >ARG1
is*  
:  
Can  >ARGM-MOD
dogs  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
see*  
the  
images  >ARG1
featured*  
in  
the  
advert  <ARG2
like  
humans  <<ARGM-MNR
?  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
animals  >ARG0
remember*  
images  <ARG1
on  
TV  
like  
us  <ARGM-MNR
,  
humans  
?  

If  
so  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
then  >>ARGM-ADV
does*  
that  >ARG1
mean*  
that  
if  
you  >ARG0
watched*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
scary  
movie  <ARG1
and  
your  
dog  >ARG1
/  
cat  
/  
parrot  
was*  
in  
the  
same  
room  <ARG2
as  
you  
they  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
also  >>ARGM-DIS
get*  
scared*  
?  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
--  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
particularly  >ARGM-ADV
like*  
scary  
movies  <ARG1
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tried*  
this  <ARG1
with  
my  
pet  <ARGM-COM
.  

Although  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
that  
scary  
movies  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
affect*  
pets  <ARG1
for  
a  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
;  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
sure*  
they  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
forget*  
sometime  <ARGM-TMP
--  
or  
am*  
I  >ARG1
wrong*  
?  

So  
what  
about  
T.V.  
?  

Do*  
dogs  >ARG0
enjoy*  
watching*  
T.V.  <ARG1
?  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
T.V.  >ARG1
is*  
a  
series  >>ARG1
of  
flickering  
pictures  
that  >>R-ARG1
are*  
streamed*  
together  <ARGM-PRD
to  
make*  
a  
moving  
picture  <ARG1
.  

The  
pictures  >>ARG1
are*  
broadcast*  
at  
a  
rate  <ARGM-MNR
of  
about  
60  
Hz  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
is*  
how  
fast  >>ARGM-MNR
they  >>ARG1
need*  
to  
move*  
for  
us  >ARG0
to  
see*  
them  <ARG1
as  
a  
moving  
,  
flawless  
picture  <ARG2
.  

To  
a  
dog  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
watching*  >ARG1
T.V.  <ARG1
is*  
a  
lot  
like  
watching*  
and  
old  
scratchy  
silent  
film  <ARG1
because  
their  >ARG1
flicker  >ARG1
fusion*  >>ARG1
seems*  
to  
occur*  
at  
a  
rate  <ARGM-MNR
of  
70  
to  
80  
Hz  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG0
see*  
the  
pictures  >ARG1
flicker*  
slower  <ARGM-MNR
and  
there  
for  >ARGM-DIS
it  
seems*  
choppy  <ARG1
to  
them  <ARG2
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
chances*  >ARG1
are*  
that  
if  
your  
dog  >>ARG0
likes*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
watch*  
T.V.  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG1
’s*  
probably  <ARGM-ADV
because  
of  
the  
sounds*  
.  

Hearing  >ARG1
is*  
a  
dog  >ARG0
’s  
secondary  >ARGM-ADJ
sense*  
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
discuss*  
that  <ARG1
in  
another  
blog  
entery  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG0
do*  
.  

i  >>ARG0
m*  
pretty  >ARGM-ADV
sure*  
that  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
see*  
things  <ARG1
on  
the  
tv  
screen  <ARGM-LOC
because  
my  
cat  >ARG0
chases*  
things  <ARG1
around  
the  
tv  
screen  <ARGM-DIR

How  
much  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
I  >>ARG0
be*  
looking*  
at  <C-ARG1
for  
horse  >ARG1
transportation*  
?  

I  >ARG0
need*  
one  
horse  >ARG1
transported*  
to  
shows*  
throughout  
the  
2012  >ARGM-TMP
show*  
season  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
the  
location  >ARG1
is*  
about  
3  
hours  
away  <ARG2
from  
where  >ARGM-LOC
I  >ARG0
live*  
.  

The  
place  >>ARG0
where  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARGA
'm*  
boarding*  
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
likely*  
to  
want*  
to  
take*  
me  <ARG1
this  
far  <ARG3
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
any  
ways*  
of  
hauling*  
him  <ARG1
myself  <ARGM-REC
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
hire*  
someone  >ARG0
(  
or  
multiple  
people  
)  
to  
transport*  
me  <ARG1
to  
these  
shows*  
.  

If  
they  >ARG0
ask*  >>ARGM-ADV
how  
much  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
willing*  
to  
pay*  
,  
what  >ARG2
is*  
a  
good  
price  
range  <ARG1
?  

I  >ARG0
saw*  
a  
site  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
charges*  
$  <ARG1
0.70  
per  
mile  
.  

Is*  
that  >ARG1
reasonable*  
?  

Impossible  
to  
say*  
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
guess*  
you  >>ARG0
would  
have*  
to  
work*  
out  
fuel  >ARG1
consumption*  
for  
the  
particular  
vehicle  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
they  >>ARG0
are*  
using*  
and  
pay*  
a  
proportion  <ARG1
of  
that  
,  
and  
some  
on  
top  
for  
the  
driver  >ARG0
's  
time  <ARG3
and  
effort*  
,  
unless  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
able*  
to  
share*  
transport*  
with  
another  <<ARG2
or  
more  
,  
that  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
keep*  
the  
costs  <ARG1
down  <ARG2
.  

Remember*  
that  
you  >ARG0
get*  
what  >ARG3
you  >ARG0
pay*  
for  <C-ARG3
.  

Three  
hours  >>ARG1
is*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
far*  
,  
but  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
doing*  
multiple  >ARGM-ADJ
shows*  
.  

Some  
people  >>ARG0
are*  
willing*  
to  
take*  
your  
horse  <ARG1
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
have*  
old  
trailers  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
are*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
safest  <ARG2
in  
the  
world  
.  

Rusted*  
,  
torn  
corners  >ARG0
in  
the  
stalls  
,  
unhealthy  
air  
,  
straight  
load  
instead  
of  
slant  
load  
can  >ARGM-MOD
all  
make*  
travelling  >>ARG0
hard*  
,  
if  
not  
downright  >ARGM-ADV
dangerous*  
,  
on  
your  
horse  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
had*  
my  
horse  >ARG1
transported*  
from  
CA  <ARG2
to  
WA  <ARG3
and  
he  >ARG1
came*  
on  
this  
big  
,  
open  
stock  
trailer  <ARGM-MNR
.  

He  >>ARG0
was*  
dehydrated  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG1
got*  
there  <ARG2
and  
lost*  
weight  <ARG1
.  

Since  
then  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
use*  
a  
professional  >>ARGM-ADJ
horse  >ARG1
hauling*  >ARG1
service*  
with  
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
ride*  
with  
my  
horse  <ARGM-COM
to  
keep*  
an  
eye  <ARG1
on  
him  <ARG2
,  
stop*  
every  
few  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
for  
water  <ARGM-PRP
,  
and  
their  
trailers  >ARG0
all  
have*  
super  
smooth  >ARGM-ADJ
suspension*  
.  

All  
horses  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG0
've*  
had*  
delivered*  
to  
me  <ARG2
since  
then  <ARGM-TMP
are*  
happy*  
and  
healthy*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG1
arrive*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
call*  
Bob  <ARG1
Hubbard  
Transport  
and  
get*  
a  
quote*  
.  

Even  
though  
you  >>ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
want*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
use*  
them  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
give*  
you  <ARG2
some  
idea  <ARG1
of  
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
cost*  
and  
what  >>ARG1
is*  
fair*  
.  

See*  
link  <ARG1
below  
.  

Make*  
sure*  
the  
trailer  >ARG1
service*  >>ARG0
you  >ARG0
use*  
is*  
bonded*  
/  
insured*  
and  
knows*  
something  <ARG1
about  
first  >ARGM-ADJ
aid*  
.  

Do*  
they  >ARG0
have*  
this  <ARG1
anywhere  <ARGM-LOC
?  

I  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
cruise*  
around  
the  
world  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >ARG0
mean*  
literally  <ARGM-ADV
around  
the  
world  <ARG2
if  
possible  <ARGM-ADV
.  

First  
of  
if  
i  >ARG0
went*  
alone  <ARGM-MNR
on  
a  
regular  
cabin  <ARGM-LOC
how  
much  >>ARG2
would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
estimate*  
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
a  
guess*  
.  

Second  >ARGM-DIS
is*  
there  
any  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
to  
sort  
of  >ARGM-ADV
customize*  
the  
places  >>ARG4
you  >>ARG0
wan*  
na  
go*  
to  <C-ARG4
?  

Like  >ARGM-DIS
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
pick*  
the  
destinations  <ARG1
?  

But  
if  
not  >ARGM-ADV
just  >ARGM-ADV
say*  
no  <ARG1
but  
i  >ARG0
hope*  
there  
is*  
like  <ARGM-DIS
one  <ARG1
out  
there  
somewhere  
.

.  
Here  >ARG2
's*  
a  
site  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
lists*  
world  
cruises  <ARG1
including  
prices*  
.  

http://www.cruisecompete.com/specials/regions/world/1  

Prices*  >>ARG1
listed*  
,  
however  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
are*  
usually  >ARGM-ADV
based*  
on  
two  
people  <ARG2
in  
a  
cabin  
,  
and  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
likely  >ARGM-ADV
face*  
some  
high  
"  
single  
supplement  
"  
costs  <ARG1
in  
addition*  
.  

(  
Two  
people  >ARG0
in  
a  
cabin  
will  >ARGM-MOD
spend*  
more  <ARG3
onboard  <ARGM-LOC
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
cruise  
lines  >ARG0
charge*  
you  >ARG0
more  <ARG1
to  
sail*  
alone  <ARGM-MNR
.  

You  >>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
do*  
better  <ARGM-MNR
on  
the  
rates  <ARG2
if  
you  >ARG0
request*  
competitive  >ARGM-ADJ
quotes*  
via  
CruiseCompete  <<ARGM-MNR
)  
.  

2  
.  
Short*  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
chartering*  
your  
own  
ship  <ARG1
and  
crew  
,  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see*  
any  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
customize*  
your  
own  
itinerary  <ARG1

Good  
luck  
!  

Various  
world  
cruises  
from  
most  
of  
the  
major  
cruise  
lines  
,  
typically  
100  
days  
in  
duration  
.  

Travelling*  
on  
your  
own  <ARGM-MNR
you  >>ARG0
would  
have*  
to  
pay*  
double  <ARG1
as  
cabins  >>ARG1
are*  
sold*  
on  
the  
basis  <ARGM-MNR
of  
double  
occupancy  
.  

No  
possibility  
to  
customise*  
ports  <ARG1
of  
call*  
.  

Prearranged*  
about  
18  
months  
in  
advance*  
as  
the  
cruise  
lines  >ARG0
sell*  
segments  <ARG1
all  
along  
the  
way*  
i.e  
Transatlantic  
to  
London  
(  
England  
)  
,  
England  
to  
Barcelona  
(  
Spain

,  
Barcelona

Alexandria  
(  
Egypt  
)  
,  
Egypt  
to  
India  
via  
Suez  
canal  
etc  
.  

yes  >ARGM-DIS
there  
are*  
multiple  
around  
the  
world  
cruises  >ARG1
,  
mainly  >ARGM-MNR
offered*  
by  
the  
more  
upscale  
lines  <ARG0
.  

HOWEVER  >ARGM-DIS
:  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
pay*  
as  
if  
there  
are*  
2  
people  <ARG1
in  
the  
cabin  
,  
even  
if  
it  >ARG1
is*  
just  
you  <ARG2
.  

so  
any  
price*  >>ARG1
you  >ARG0
find*  
,  
DOUBLE*  
IT  <C-ARG1
figure*  
,  
$  <ARG1
40  
K  
at  
least  
.  

and  
no  >ARGM-DIS
you  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
customize*  
an  
itinerary  <ARG1
unless  
you  >ARG0
book*  
several  
different  
legs  <ARG1
of  
a  
cruise  
with  
stops*  
in  
between  <ARGM-ADV
on  
shore  <ARGM-LOC
..  
say  >>ARGM-DIS
book*  
a  
Panamal  
Canal  >ARG1
crossing*  
,  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
fly*  
to  
Asia  <ARGM-DIR
and  
pick*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
again  <ARGM-TMP
and  
sail*  
to  
India  <ARGM-DIR
then  >ARGM-TMP
fly*  
to  
Europe  <ARGM-DIR
to  
sail*  
the  
Med  <ARGM-LOC
before  
flying*  
to  
England  <ARGM-DIR
to  
hit*  
the  
Transatlantic  >ARG1
corssing*  
.  

Was  
the  
San  
Francisco  
Bay  
Area  
mostly  
Caucasian  
back  
in  
the  
early  
1970s  
?  

No  
.  

There  
has*  
been*  
a  
large  
Asian  
presence  <ARG1
in  
the  
SF  
Bay  
Area  <ARGM-LOC
for  
a  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
--  
the  
Chinatown  >ARG1
here  
was*  
the  
largest  >ARGM-ADJ
population*  
of  
chinese  <ARG2
outside  <ARG1
of  
China  
,  
there  
were*  
lots  <ARG1
of  
Japanese  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG1
'd*  >>ARGM-MOD
been*  
displaced*  
during  
WWII  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
whole  
Western  
Addition  >>ARG1
and  
a  
large  
portion  
of  
the  
Haight  
was*  
black*  
.  

The  
Mission  >ARG1
was*  
basically  <ARGM-ADV
latin  
-  
american  <ARG2
.  

As  
the  
southeast  
asians  >ARG1
and  
philipinos  
came*  >ARGM-ADV
over  <ARGM-DIR
,  
they  >ARG0
added*  
to  
the  
cultures  <ARG2
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
Bay  
Area  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
fairly  
mixed  <ARG2
ethnically  <ARGM-MNR
for  
a  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
--  
caucasians  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
seemed*  
to  
be*  
a  
large  
populous  <ARG2
but  
that  >ARG1
's*  
because  
most  
tourists  >ARG1
back  
then  >ARGM-TMP
were*  
caucasian  <ARG2
and  
many  >ARG1
of  
the  
hippies  
were*  
caucasians  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG1
's*  
who  
the  
photographers  >ARG0
took*  
pictures  <ARG1
of  <ARG1
.  

The  
other  
ethicities  >>ARG1
were*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
well  >ARGM-MNR
represented*  
in  
politics  <ARG2
yet  <ARGM-TMP
--  
or  
rather  
,  
they  >>ARG0
were*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
breaking*  
the  
color  
barrier  <ARG1
in  
the  
70's  <ARGM-TMP
due  
largely  
to  
the  
more  
open  
-  
minded  
hippy  
generation  <ARGM-CAU
.  

Marin  
County  >ARG1
was*  
predominantly  
caucasian  <ARG2
and  
many  >ARG0
of  
the  
expanding  
outer  
east  
bay  
areas  
started*  
out  
as  
white  
suburbs  <ARG2
.  

It  
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
so  
long  
after  
Civil  >ARG2
Rights*  
laws  >>ARG0
against  
discrimination*  
started*  
to  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
impact*  
.  

You  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
saw*  
black  
MUNI  
drivers  <ARG1
,  
Asian  
police  
,  
Latino  
politicians  
until  
then  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
an  
evolution*  
.  

Many  
illegals  >>ARG1
were*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
counted*  
in  
the  
population*  
until  
the  
mid-80s  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
big  
percent  <ARG1
of  
Chinese  >ARG0
migration*  
until  
the  
mid  
90s  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >ARG0
had*  
fewer  
people  >ARG0
running*  
across  
the  
Mexican  
border  <ARGM-DIR
then  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG1
had*  
fewer  >ARGM-ADJ
social  >ARGM-ADJ
benefits*  
at  
that  
time  <ARGM-TMP
for  
people  <ARGM-GOL
so  >>ARGM-ADV
many  
immigrants  >>ARG1
were*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
counted*  
.  

Only  
Caucasians  >>ARG0
had*  
any  
political  
power  <ARG1
,  
corporate  
presence  
or  
owned*  
businesses  <ARG1
except  
for  
Mom  
and  
Pop  
stores  <ARGM-ADV
in  
some  
neighborhoods  
.  

San  >>ARG1
Francisco  
was*  
settled*  
in  
the  
19th  
and  
20th  
century  <ARGM-TMP
by  
mainly  
European  
immigrants  <ARG0
except  
for  
some  
Asian  
workers  >ARG1
who  >R-ARG1
were*  
manual  
laborers  <ARG2
.  

There  
has*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
been*  
a  
Mexican  
-  
American  >ARG0
cultural  >ARG1
influence*  
since  
Calif  >>ARG1
was*  
owned*  
by  
Mexico  <ARG0
.  

We  >ARG0
had*  
a  
larger  >ARGM-CXN
black  >ARG2
population*  
in  
the  
70s  <<ARGM-TMP
than  
we  >ARG0
have*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
but  
they  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
any  
power  <ARG1
until  
Willie  >>ARG1
Brown  
was*  
elected*  
.  

San  >ARG1
Francisco  
was*  
always  <ARGM-TMP
progressive  <ARG2
and  
welcoming  
and  
tolerant  
to  
all  
kinds  
of  
people  
historically  <ARGM-ADV
.  

The  
counties  >>ARG1
outside  
San  
Francisco  
were*  
more  >ARGM-CXN
white*  
than  
San  <C-ARGM-CXN
Francisco  
in  
the  
70s  <ARGM-TMP
.

My  
memory  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
good*  
so  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
a  
more  
accurate  >ARGM-ADJ
answer*  
from  
someone  >ARG0
else  
who  >R-ARG0
remembers*  
the  
time  <ARG1
.  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
rabbits  >ARG0
and  
chickens  
live*  
together  <ARGM-COM
?  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
thinking*  
about  
getting*  
a  
rabbit  <ARG1
as  
a  
pet  <ARGM-PRD
,  
but  
my  
parents  >ARG0
said*  
that  
it  >>ARG1
has*  
to  
stay*  
outside  <ARG3
.  

We  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
own*  
two  
chickens  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are*  
kept*  
in  
a  
run  <ARGM-LOC
behind  
out  
garage  
/  
barn  
thing  
.  

There  
is*  
already  <ARGM-TMP
a  
little  
dog  
house  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
turn*  
into  
a  
little  
rabbit  
hutch  <ARG2
being*  
kept*  
back  
there  <ARGM-LOC
and  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
thinking*  
about  
keeping*  
the  
rabbit  <ARG1
in  
the  
run  <ARGM-LOC
with  
the  
chickens  <ARGM-COM
,  
but  
keeping*  
the  
chickens  <ARG1
in  
the  
coop  <ARGM-LOC
and  
the  
rabbit  
in  
the  
hutch  
at  
night  
.  

However  >ARGM-ADV
,  
in  
the  
day  
time  >ARGM-TMP
would  >ARGM-MOD
it  
be*  
okay  <ARG2
for  
the  
rabbit  >ARG0
to  
hop*  
around  <ARGM-PRD
along  
with  
the  
chickens  <ARGM-COM
?  

We  >ARG0
feed*  
the  
chickens  <ARG2
scraps  <ARG1
of  
veggies  
and  
fruits  
throughout  
the  
day  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
's*  
nothing  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
a  
rabbit  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
able*  
to  
digest*  
just  
fine  <ARGM-MNR
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
rabbits  >ARG0
and  
chickens  
live*  
together  <ARGM-ADV
as  
long  <ARGM-TMP
as  
they  >ARG0
have*  
separate  
places  <ARG1
for  
their  
food  
and  
water  
?  

(  
The  
rabbit  
hutch  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
an  
opening*  
only  
big  <ARGM-ADJ
enough  
for  
the  
rabbit  
,  
the  
chickens  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
able*  
to  
get*  
to  
the  
rabbit  
food  <ARG2
)  
Also  >ARGM-DIS
,  
is*  
it  <ARG1
okay  <ARG2
if  
the  
rabbit  >ARG0
occasionally  >ARGM-TMP
sneaks*  
a  
few  
bites*  
of  
chicken  
feed  <ARG1
?  

My  
last  
rabbit  >ARG0
did*  
that  <ARG1
a  
few  
times  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
he  >>ARG1
was*  
fine*  
...  

I  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
wan*  
na  
make*  
sure*  
:)  
Thank  
!  

Yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
but  >ARGM-DIS
be*  
sure*  
that  
your  
chickens  >ARG1
are*  
all  <ARGM-ADV
hens  <ARG2
(  
I  >ARG0
mean*  
not  
roosters  <ARG2
)  
,  
Roosters  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
attack*  
rabbits  <ARG1
or  
anything  >>ARG1
they  >ARG0
see*  
moving*  
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
aware*  
of  
that  <ARG1
,  
hens  >>ARG1
are*  
friendly*  
with  
almost  
all  
kinds  <ARG2
of  
pets  
!  

From  
my  >ARG0
experience*  >>ARGM-ADV
Hens  >>ARG1
(  
Not  
roosters  
)  
are*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
friendly*  
with  
duck  <ARG2
,  
Guinea  
pigs  
,  
kittens  
,  
cows  
,  
Rabbits  
,  
etc  
.  

Be*  
sure*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
feed*  
your  
rabbits  <ARG2
non-veg  
items  <ARG1
!  

You  >ARG0
said*  
they  >ARG0
live*  
in  
different  
cages  <ARGM-LOC
and  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
free*  
in  
day  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
no  
problem  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
put*  
both  <ARG1
of  
them  
in  
one  
cage  <ARG2
because  
rabbits  >ARG1
bedding*  >>ARG1
is*  
different*  
than  
that  <ARG2
of  
hens  
,  
wet  >ARGM-ADJ
bedding*  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
cause*  
diseases  <ARG1
in  
them  <ARGM-LOC
!  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
put*  
both  <ARG1
of  
them  
in  
one  
cage  <ARG2
.  

Good  
luck  
!  

yea  >ARGM-DIS
i  >ARG0
guess*  
but  
rabbits  >ARG0
a  >ARGM-MOD
easily  >ARGM-ADV
escape*  
a  
pen  <ARG1
or  
another  
rabbit  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
in  
there  <ARG2
and  
that  
rabbit  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
opposite  
gender  <ARG2
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
be*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
careful*  
and  
some  
feeds  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
toxic*  
to  
rabbits  <ARG1
and  
safe*  
for  
chickens  <ARG1
.  

Rabbits  >>ARG0
do*  
burrow*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
so  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
surprised*  
if  
chicken  >>ARG1
are*  
falling*  
into  
holes  <ARG4
.  

rabbits  >>ARG0
are*  
delicate  <ARG2
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
diseases  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-DIS
watch*  
out  
for  
that  <ARG1
.  

melting*  >>ARG1
brass  <ARG1
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
work*  
?  

my  
friends  >>ARG0
and  
I  
are*  
trying*  
to  
melt*  
bras  <ARG1
to  
make*  
some  
little  
figures  <ARG1
.  

we  >>ARG0
have*  
made*  
a  
furnace  <ARG1
as  
such  <ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >>ARG0
took*  
a  
clay  
flower  
pot  <ARG1
with  
a  
hole  
in  
the  
bottom  
put*  
a  
piece  <ARG1
of  
steel  
pipe  
in  
the  
middle  <ARG2
of  
it  
with  
a  
cap  <ARGM-MNR
on  
the  
bottom  
,  
filled*  
the  
pipe  <ARG1
with  
brass  
scrap  <ARG2
,  
surounded*  
the  
pipe  <ARG2
with  
charcoal  <ARG1
lit*  
it  <ARG1
off  <ARGM-PRD
and  
pumped*  
air  <ARG2
through  
the  
hole  <ARG1
in  
the  
pot  
,  
everything  >>ARG1
got*  
red  >ARGM-PRD
hot*  
but  
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
melt*  
.  

what  >>ARG1
am*  
I  >ARG0
doing*  
wrong  <ARGM-MNR

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
to  
start*  
with  
something  <ARG2
more  
simple  
like  
tin  
,  
pewter  
,  
aluminum  
or  
zinc  
,  
they  >ARG0
all  
have*  
a  
much  
more  
reasonable  
melting  
point  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
echo*  
both  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
answers*  
.  

Molten  
brass  >>ARG1
is*  
damn  >ARGM-ADV
hot*  
and  
usually  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
's*  
pressurized*  
gas  <ARG1
and  
forced*  
air  <ARG1
or  
oxygen  
.  

Even  
if  
you  >>ARG0
did*  
melt*  >ARGM-ADV
it  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
doubt*  
you  >ARG0
foresaw*  
the  
issues*  
of  
handling*  
it  <ARG1
and  
pouring*  
it  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
really  >ARGM-ADV
too  >ARGM-EXT
advanced*  
for  
a  
beginner  <ARGM-GOL
,  
both  
in  
tooling  <ARG2
and  
safety  
.  

Just  >ARGM-ADV
the  
zinc  
fumes  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
you  <ARG1
,  
if  
you  
do*  
n't  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
precautions*  
.  

Pewter  >>ARG1
is*  
perfect*  
for  
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
are*  
doing*  
,  
and  
it  >ARG1
melts*  
on  
a  
stove  
top  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
to  
start*  
with  
something  <ARG2
more  
simple  
like  
tin  
,  
pewter  
,  
aluminum  
or  
zinc  
,  
they  >ARG0
all  
have*  
a  
much  
more  
reasonable  
melting  
point  <ARG1
.  

Brass  >ARG0
has*  
an  
even  
higher  
melting  
point  <ARG1
than  
bronze  
and  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
think*  
your  
charcoal  >>ARG1
just  >>ARGM-ADV
does*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
get*  
hot*  >ARG2
enough*  
.  

I  >ARG0
bet*  
you  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-ADV
did*  
take*  
charcoal  >>ARG1
as  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
used*  >>ARG1
for  
barbecue  <ARG2
which  >>R-ARG1
does*  
not  >>ARGM-NEG
get*  
as  >ARGM-CXN
hot*  
as  
real  
coal  <C-ARGM-CXN
(  
e.g.  >>ARGM-ADV
for  
blacksmithing*  >ARGM-PRP
one  >ARG0
needs*  
coal  <ARG1
,  
not  
barbecue  
charcoal  
)  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
done*  
a  
fair  
amount  <ARG1
of  
metal  >ARG2
casting*  
,  
but  
never  >ARGM-NEG
tried*  
to  
build*  
my  
own  
furnace  <ARG1
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
think*  
your  
version  >>ARG1
is*  
just  >ARGM-DIS
too  >ARGM-EXT
small*  
and  
does*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
get*  
hot*  >ARG2
enough*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
melted*  
small  
amounts  <ARG1
of  
bronze  
in  
a  
crucible  <ARGM-LOC
with  
a  
large  
propane  
torch  <ARGM-MNR
(  
much  
larger  
than  
the  
plumbers  
torch  
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
run*  
of  
those  
propane  
cylinders  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
buy*  
for  
a  
gas  
grill  <ARGM-PRP
)  
.  

I  >>ARG0
melt*  
brass  <ARG1
and  
cast*  
it  <ARG2
http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm  

Brass  >ARG1
melts*  
at  
just  
under  
2000  
F  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
is*  
a  
bright  
yellow  
heat  <ARG2
,  
not  
red  
hot  
.  

http://www.mikegigi.com/techspec.htm#SELCTEMP  

You  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
make*  
a  
version  >ARG1
of  
your  
setup  
work*  
,  
but  
it  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
quite  
a  
bit  <ARG1
of  
charcoal  
and  
a  
lot  
of  
forced*  
air  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
use*  
propane  <ARG1
with  
a  
blower  <ARGM-MNR
and  
a  
burner  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
built*  
http://www.mikegigi.com/meltmetl.htm  
and

Should  >ARGM-MOD
all  
UK  
towns  >ARG0
and  
their  
cafes  
or  
restaurants  
provide*  
Halal  
food  <ARG1
?  

Some  
friends  >ARG0
of  
mine  
visited*  
Dartmouth  <ARG1
in  
Devon  <ARGM-LOC
whilst  
on  
holiday*  
last  
summer  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
find*  
any  
cafes  >ARG0
or  
food  
shops  
that  >R-ARG0
provided*  
Halal  
prepared  
foods  <ARG1
.  

It  
s*  
important*  
to  
their  
religion  <ARG2
that  
they  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
consume*  
Halal  
food  <ARG1
.  

Even  
if  
you  >ARG0
buy*  >ARGM-ADV
a  
cake  <ARG1
in  
a  
baker  <ARGM-LOC
s  
you  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
too  <ARG2
what  >ARG1
happens*  
in  
the  
kitchen  <ARGM-LOC
,  
for  
example  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
cake  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
sliced*  
using*  
a  
knife  >ARG1
used*  
for  
preparing*  
ham  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
s*  
simply  <ARGM-ADV
not  <ARGM-NEG
just  
a  
case*  
of  
avoiding*  
pork  
,  
alcohol  <ARG1
and  
only  >>ARGM-ADV
being*  
allowed*  
to  
eat*  
halal  
prepared  
meat  <ARG1
,  
but  
the  
kitchen  >>ARG1
and  
its  
utensils  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
have*  
been*  
used*  
for  
prohibited  
foods  <ARG2
.  

Places  >>ARG0
like  
Dartmouth  
are*  
supposed*  
to  
be*  
tourist  
towns  <ARG2
and  
should  >ARGM-MOD
provide*  
foods  <ARG1
for  
people  <ARG2
of  
all  
religions  
.  

We  >ARG0
all  
enjoy*  
buying*  
a  
snack  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
visiting*  
a  
town  <ARG1
or  
attraction*  
while  
on  
holiday*  
.  

Not  
everyone  >>ARG0
wants*  
to  
bring*  
packed  
lunch  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
s*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
fair*  
if  
some  
people  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
go*  
without  
buying*  
food  <ARG1
because  
no  
place  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
provide*  
suitable  
food  <ARG1
for  
them  
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
it  
s*  
only  >ARGM-ADV
fair*  
that  
nowadays  >ARGM-TMP
every  
town  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
provide*  
at  
least  
one  
halal  
cafe  <ARG1
or  
restaurant  
and  
hopefully  >ARGM-ADV
one  
day  >ARGM-TMP
every  
British  
catering  
establishment  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
halal  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
went*  >ARGM-TMP
to  
Bosnia  <ARG4
,  
all  
the  
meat  >ARG1
was*  
Halal  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
eat*  
halal  
meat  <ARG1
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
guess*  
what  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
opted*  
for  
foods  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
were*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
a  
meat  
dish  <ARG2
,  
there  
were*  
plenty  <ARG1
of  
other  
options  
.  

I  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
go*  
to  
their  
country  <ARG4
and  
demand*  
they  >>ARG0
slaughter*  
and  
sell*  
an  
animal  <ARG1
as  
meat  <ARGM-PRD
the  
way  >ARGM-MNR
I  >>ARG0
prefer*  
to  
eat*  
it  <ARG1
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
go*  >ARGM-ADV
to  
another  
country  <ARG4
,  
you  >ARG0
live*  
by  
their  >ARG0
way*  
of  
life  <ARG1
and  
their  
laws  
,  
if  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like*  >ARGM-ADV
it  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
know*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
get*  
back  <ARG2
out  
the  
country  
(  
but  
I  >ARG0
guess*  
our  
benefits  
system  >>ARG0
is*  
too  >ARGM-CXN
much*  
to  
throw*  
away  
,  
huh  <<ARGM-DIS
)  
.  

Cafes  >ARG0
and  
restaurants  
rarely  >ARGM-TMP
use*  
the  
same  
cutlery  <ARG1
for  
different  
food  
groups  
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >ARG0
normally  >ARGM-ADV
have*  
blue  <ARG1
for  
bakery  
items  <ARG1
,  
red  <ARG1
for  
cooked  
meat  
,  
brown  <ARG1
for  
raw  
meat  
,  
etc  <ARG1
-  <ARG1
all  
for  
food  >ARG1
preparation*  
and  
hygiene  
policies  <<ARG1
.  

No  
.  

To  
prevent*  >ARGM-PRP
animal  
cruelty  <ARG1
,  
many  
countries  >ARG0
forbid*  
Halal  
and  
Kosher  
meat  <ARG1
.  

Switzerland  >ARG1
is*  
one  <ARG2
,  
and  
the  
Netherlands  >>ARG0
are*  
passing*  
the  
same  
law  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
become*  
EU  
law  <ARG2
in  
a  
couple  <ARGM-TMP
of  
years  
.  

We  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
dictate*  
what  
business  >>ARG1
wants*  
to  
open*  
where  <ARGM-LOC
.  

If  
someone  >ARG0
thinks*  >>ARGM-ADV
there  
is*  
a  
business  
opportunity  <ARG1
then  >ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
start*  
opening*  
halal  
only  
places  <ARG1
.  

How  >ARGM-MNR
to  
convince*  
my  
parents  >ARG0
to  
let*  
me  >ARG0
get*  
a  
Ball  
python  <ARG1
?  

They  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
ANYTHING  <ARG1
about  
Ball  
pythons  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
ask*  >ARGM-TMP
my  
mom  <ARG2
she  >ARG0
says*  
she  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
let*  
a  
snake  <ARG1
in  
her  
house  <ARG1
.  

She  >>ARG0
has*  >ARGM-LVB
no  >ARGM-NEG
experience*  
with  
snakes  <ARG1
and  
has*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
held*  
one  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
did*  
all  
my  >ARG0
research*  
and  
am*  
well  
prepared  <ARG2
to  
keep*  
one  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG1
'm*  
14  <ARG2
by  
the  
way  <ARGM-DIS

Lay*  
some  
knowledge  <ARG1
on  
them  <ARG2
dude  <ARGM-DIS
.  

Maybe  
if  
they  >ARG0
see*  >>ARGM-ADV
how  
much  >ARGM-EXT
time  >>ARG1
and  
effort*  
you  >>ARG0
've*  
devoted*  
to  
researching*  
the  
animal  <ARG1
they  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
reconsider*  
.  

Tell*  
them  <ARG2
it  
costs*  
like  
8  
dollars  <ARG2
a  
month  
(  
if  
even  
that  
much  <ARGM-ADV
)  
to  
keep*  
it  >ARG2
fed*  
.  

Be*  
helpful*  
around  
the  
house  <ARGM-LOC
to  
show*  
that  
even  
if  
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
pay*  
for  
it  <ARG3
yourself  <ARGM-REC
that  
you  >>ARG0
re*  
willing*  
to  
work*  
for  
it  <ARGM-GOL
.  

Once  
you  >>ARG0
've*  
buttered*  >>ARGM-TMP
them  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-DIR
a  
bit  <ARGM-EXT
try*  
to  
get*  
them  <ARG1
to  
the  
pet  
store  <ARG2
and  
ask*  
one  >ARG0
of  
the  
employees  
to  
handle*  
the  
snake  <ARG1
showing*  
your  
mom  <ARG2
how  
gentle  >ARG2
and  
harmless  
they  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
.  

Maybe  
even  >ARGM-ADV
try*  
to  
get*  
your  
mom  >ARG0
to  
hold*  
it  <ARG1
a  
bit  <ARGM-ADV
.  

My  
wife  >>ARG1
was*  
TERRIFIED*  
of  
snakes  <ARG0
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
met*  
,  
I  >ARG0
introduced*  
her  <ARG1
to  
one  <ARG2
out  
my  
baby  
corn  
snakes  
and  
she  >ARG1
fell*  
in  
love*  
with  
it  <<ARGM-COM
.  

Be*  
persistent*  
,  
but  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
pester*  
them  <ARG1
about  
it  <ARGM-ADV
cause  
that  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
you  <ARG1
nowhere  <ARG2
fast  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Good  
luck  
!  

My  
general  
convince*  
your  
parents  >ARG0
to  
let*  
you  >ARG0
get*  
a  
reptile  <ARG1
advice  
:  

1  
.  
Be*  
responsible*  
.  

Do*  
all  
your  
chores  <ARG1
without  
being*  
nagged*  
,  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
any  
existing  
pets  <ARG1
,  
keep*  
your  
room  >ARG1
clean*  
,  
and  
so  
on  
.  

Prove*  
,  
to  
your  
parents  >ARG1
'  
satisfaction*  
,  
that  
you  >ARG1
,  
not  
they  
,  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
one  >>ARG0
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
taking*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
your  
new  
pet  <ARG1
.  

2  
.  
Save*  
up  
,  
and  
research*  
,  
so  
that  
you  >>ARG1
are*  
ready*  
for  
your  
new  
pet  <ARG2
.  

3  
.  
Bargain*  
with  
them  <ARG2
.  

Offer*  
to  
do*  
extra  
chores  <ARG1
,  
ask*  
for  
your  
pet  <ARG1
as  
a  
reward  <ARGM-PRD
for  
good  
grades  
,  
something  <ARGM-ADV
like  
that  
.  

4  
.  
Play*  
the  
sympathy  
card  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
find*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
pet  <ARG1
at  
a  
shelter  <ARGM-LOC
,  
or  
that  >>ARG1
a  
friend  >>ARG0
needs*  
to  
get*  >ARGM-LVB
rid*  
of  <C-ARG1
because  
they  >>ARG1
're*  
moving*  
or  
whatever  
,  
you  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
talk*  
your  
parents  <ARG1
into  
"  
giving*  
it  <ARG2
a  
good  
home  <ARG1
"  
where  >>ARGM-LOC
you  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
able*  
to  
talk*  
them  <ARG1
into  
buying*  
a  
new  
pet  <ARG1
.  

On  
the  
fear  
angle  >ARGM-ADV
--  
talk*  
her  <ARG1
into  
coming*  
to  
the  
pet  
store  <ARG4
with  
you  <ARGM-COM
.  

Once  
you  >ARG1
're*  
there  >ARGM-TMP
,  
ask*  
if  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
hold*  
a  
ball  
python  <ARG1
.  

Once  
you  >>ARG0
're*  
holding*  >ARGM-TMP
it  <ARG1
,  
try*  
to  
get*  
her  >>ARG0
to  
touch*  
/  
pet*  
it  <ARG1
...  

My  
Snake  
's  
meal  >>ARG1
is*  
TOO  >ARGM-EXT
big*  
,  
what  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
do*  
?  

Just  
today  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
bought*  
a  
medium  
rat  <ARG1
for  
my  
beloved  
Ball  
Python  <ARG4
Salazar  >ARG1
(  
name*  
after  
Harry  <ARG2
Potter  
)  
.  

Last  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
got*  
a  
medium  
rat  <ARG1
it  >ARG1
was*  
a  
girl  <ARG2
and  
my  
snake  >ARG0
handled*  
her  <ARG1
easily  <ARGM-MNR
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
today  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
got*  
a  
boy  <ARG1
and  
realized*  
that  
he  >>ARG1
is*  
HUGE*  
!  

I  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
love*  
my  
snake  <ARG1
cause  
she  >ARG1
is*  
actually  <ARGM-ADV
an  
affectionate  
cold  
-  
blooded  
creature  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
my  
true  
question  >ARG1
comes*  
to  
this  <ARG4
,  
how  >ARGM-MNR
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
knock*  
the  
rat  <ARG1
out  <C-V
?  

If  
I  >ARG0
threw*  >ARGM-ADV
him  <ARG1
against  
a  
wall  <ARG2
and  
still  
conscious  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
run*  
away  <ARGM-DIR
,  
do*  
I  >ARG0
hang*  
him  <ARG1
by  
the  
tail  <ARGM-MNR
so  
the  
blood  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
flush*  
into  
his  
skull  <ARGM-DIR
?  

I  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
need*  
answers*  
and  
advice  
,  
and  
NOT  
INSULTING  >ARGM-ADJ
ANSWERS*  
!!  

LIKE  
SERIOUSLY  
!!  
>:(  

Best  >ARGM-ADJ
answer*  >ARG0
shall  >ARGM-MOD
receive*  
points  <ARG1
:)  

iw  >>ARG0
ould  >>ARGM-MOD
just  >>ARGM-ADV
stick*  
him  <ARG1
in  
the  
tank  <ARG2
and  
let*  
your  
snake  >ARG0
have*  
a  
nice  
hunt  <ARG1
for  
once  <ARGM-TMP
,  
snakes  
jaws  >ARG1
detach*  
for  
this  
sort  <ARGM-PRP
of  
this  
thing  
,  
so  
why  >ARGM-PRP
not  >ARGM-NEG
give*  
her  <ARG2
a  
good  
hunt  <ARG1
,  
but  
if  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
want*  
him  
knock*  
him  <ARG1
i  >ARG0
d  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
throw*  
him  <ARG1
against  
the  
wall  <ARG2
or  
something  
,,  
lol  >>ARGM-DIS
i  >>ARG0
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
,  
i  >ARG0
agree*  
with  
you  <ARG2
though  <ARGM-ADV
throw*  
him  <ARG1
,  
haha  <ARGM-DIS

Ok  >>ARGM-DIS
so  >>ARGM-DIS
if  
youre  
snake  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
take*  >ARGM-ADV
pre-killed  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
"  
gas*  
it  <ARG1
"  
.  

Just  >>ARGM-ADV
put*  
the  
rat  <ARG1
in  
a  
sealed*  
tupperwear  
container  <ARG1
with  
no  
airholes  
and  
wait*  
until  
it  >>ARG1
passes*  
out  
and  
dies*  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
feed*  
it  <ARG2
.  

If  
it  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
take*  >>ARGM-ADV
pre-killed  <ARG1
and  
you  >ARG0
usually  >ARGM-ADV
feed*  
live  <ARG1
then  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
hold*  
the  
rat  <ARG1
by  
the  
tail  <ARGM-MNR
and  
whack*  
it  <ARG1
against  
a  
hard  
surface  <ARG2
,  
like  
a  
refrigerator  <ARGM-MNR
or  
wall  
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like*  
that  
option  <ARG1
though  <ARGM-ADV
-  
I  >ARG0
think*  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
cruel*  
and  
I'd  
not  >ARGM-NEG
done*  >ARGM-ADV
properly  <ARGM-MNR
you  >>ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
end*  
up  
really  >ARGM-ADV
hurting*  
the  
rat  <ARG1
but  
not  >ARGM-NEG
stunning*  
him  <ARG1
enough  <ARGM-EXT
to  
stop*  
possible  >ARGM-ADJ
injury*  
to  
your  
snake  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
the  
tupperwear  
idea  <ARG1
TBH  <ARGM-ADV
-  
easiest  
and  
most  
humane  
.  

You  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
also  >>ARGM-ADV
just  >>ARGM-ADV
wait*  
until  
the  
rat  >ARG0
passes*  
out  
for  
about  
1  
minute  <ARGM-TMP
and  
them  >ARG2
feed*  
it  <ARG1
-  
at  
this  
point  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
it  >>ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
have*  
a  
bit  <ARG1
of  
a  
heart  >ARG1
beat*  
and  
be*  
slightly  >ARGM-EXT
still  >ARGM-TMP
alive*  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
also  >ARGM-ADV
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
try*  
holding*  
the  
rat  <ARG1
in  
feeding  
prongs  <ARGM-MNR
so  
your  
snake  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
get*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
hold*  
and  
grip  
on  
his  
prey  <ARG1
.  

Good  
luck  
!  

Just  
my  
opinion  
here  
-  
no  >ARGM-NEG
judgement*  
-  
getting*  >>ARG0
your  
snake  <ARG1
on  
frozen  <ARG1
/  
thawed*  
will  >ARGM-MOD
prove*  
to  
be*  
much  >ARGM-EXT
easier*  
for  
you  <ARGM-GOL
and  
safer*  
for  
your  
snake  <ARG1
in  
the  
long  >ARGM-ADJ
run*  
.  

My  
opinion  
-  
take*  
it  <ARG1
for  
what  >>ARG2
it  >>ARG1
's*  
worth*  
…  
:-)  

Looking*  
to  
move*  
to  
Toronto  <ARG2
?  

I  >ARG1
am*  
a  
20  
something  
gay  
black  
male  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
looking*  
for  
suggestions*  
on  
neighborhoods  <ARG1
close  
to  
the  
downtown  
Toronto  
area  
.  

Im  >ARG1
moving*  
from  
South  
Carolina  <ARGM-DIR
so  >ARGM-ADV
this  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
already  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
a  
huge  >ARGM-EXT
culture  >ARG0
shock*  
.  

Any  
suggestions*  
?  

Being*  
gay*  >>ARG1
and  
living*  
in  
Toronto  <ARGM-LOC
is*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
fine*  
.  

You  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
consider*  
the  
Gay  
Village  <ARG1
on  
Church  
Street  
,  
right  
downtown  
.  

It  >>ARG1
is*  
full*  
of  
gay  
friendly  
"  
everything  <ARG2
"  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
live*  
where  
ever  >>ARG3
you  >ARG0
fancy*  >ARG0
takes*  
you  <ARG1
.  

For  
obvious  
reasons  >>ARGM-CAU
,  
knowing*  >>ARGM-CAU
how  
extremely  
difficult  >ARG2
it  
is*  
to  
drive*  
a  
car  <ARG1
in  
the  
city  <ARGM-LOC
,  
you  >>ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
try*  
to  
be*  
near  
the  
subway  
system  <ARG2
.  

But  
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
immigrate*  
?  

Being*  
an  
American  >ARG0
guarantees*  
you  <ARG2
no  
favours  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
it  
come*  
to  
going*  
to  
Canada  <ARG4
.  

Start*  
your  >ARG0
process*  
here  <<ARGM-LOC
,  
if  
you  
have*  
n't  
already  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

(  
Marrying*  >>ARG1
a  
Canadian  <ARG2
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
enough*  
-  
that  >>ARG1
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
count*  
for  
at  
least  
two  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  
)  

http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/index.asp  

A  
normal

time  >>ARG1

5  
years  <ARG2

Coming*  >>ARG0
to  
stay*  
,  
and  
overstay*  
your  >ARG0
three  
months  >ARGM-TMP
visit*  
will  >ARGM-MOD

to  
immediate  >ARGM-TMP
expulsion*  
and  
a  
lifetime  
ban  
to  
immigrate*  
to  
Canada  <ARG1
-  
NOT  
GOOD  
.  

Let*

about  
this  <ARG1
...........  

Just  >ARGM-ADV
'  
wanting*  >>ARG1
to  
come*

You  >>ARG1

and  
WAIT*

YOUR  >ARG1

How  >ARGM-MNR
to  
train*  
my  
puppy  <ARG2
?  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
4  
months  
Shih  
Tzu  
puppy  <ARG1
.  

Recently  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
having*  
trouble  <ARG1
training*  
him  <ARG2
.  

He  >>ARG0
is*  
kind  >ARGM-ADV
of  
hate*  
walking*  
with  
leash  <ARGM-MNR
,  
every  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
put*  
the  
leash  <ARG1
on  <ARG2
,  
he  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
try*  
to  
bite*  
it  <ARG1
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
he  >>ARG1
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
following*  
me  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
was*  
walking*  
.  

I  >ARG0
saw*  
lots  <ARG1
of  
videos  
about  
this  
,  
but  
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
it  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
help*  
.  

Is*  
there  
any  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
can  >ARGM-MOD
let*  
him  >ARG0
know*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
walk*  
with  
leash  <ARGM-MNR
?  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
every  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
see*  
some  
one  <ARG1
he  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
rush*  
to  
people  <ARG2
and  
jump*  
on  
them  <ARGM-LOC
,  
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
listen*  
to  
me  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG1
is*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
excited*  
about  
anybody  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
see*  
.  

How  >ARGM-MNR
to  
prevent*  
this  <ARG1
?  

Last  
thing  >ARG1
is*  
every  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
sit*  
on  
a  
chair  <ARG2
or  
something  
higher  
than  
him  
,  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
try*  
to  
jump*  
on  <ARGM-DIR
,  
if  
he  
ca  >ARGM-ADV
n't  
,  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
bark*  
all  
the  
time  <ARGM-TMP
until  
I  >ARG0
let*  
him  >ARG1
get*  
on  <ARG2
,  
what  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
do*  
with  
this  <ARG2
?  

Anyone  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
any  
suggestion*  
?  

thank*  
you  <ARG1
very  
much  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Hi  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG1
am*  
a  
dog  
trainer  <ARG2
for  
25  
yrs  
.  

You  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
purchase*  
what  >>ARG1
is*  
called*  
a  
shoulder  
point  
harness  <ARG2
.  

This  
type  >>ARG0
of  
harness  
goes*  
around  
the  
dog  
s  
chest  <ARG4
and  
legs  
and  
has*  
a  
clip  <ARG1
for  
the  
leash  
up  
on  
the  
back  
of  
the  
dog  
in  
middle  
of  
shoulder  
blades  
.  

This  
way*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
reach*  
the  
leash  <ARG1
to  
chew*  
it  <ARG1
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
swivels*  >>ARGM-TMP
his  
head  <ARG1
to  
go*  
for  
it  <ARG1
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
,  
tell*  
him  <ARG2
sharp  <ARGM-MNR
"  
UH  <ARG1
UH  
"  
gently  >ARGM-MNR
correct*  
him  <ARG1
with  
a  
small  
tug  <ARGM-MNR
and  
continue*  
your  >ARG0
walk*  
.  

Do*  
this  <ARG1
repeatedly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
frequently  
and  
he  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
learn*  
to  
walk*  
on  
a  
leash  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Patience  >ARG1
is*  
the  
key  <ARG2
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

He  >>ARG0
is*  
a  
young  
pup  <ARG2
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
learn*  
over  
time  <ARGM-MNR
and  
consistency  
in  
his  >ARG2
training*  
.  

And  
always  
,  
always  >ARGM-TMP
train*  
with  
love*  
and  
positive  
methods  
-  
never  >>ARGM-NEG
hit*  
or  
harshly  >ARGM-MNR
scold*  
.  

Never  >ARGM-NEG
train*  
out  
of  
fear*  
.  

You  >ARG0
want*  
your  
dog  >>ARG0
to  
admire*  
you  <ARG1
as  
his  
pack  
leader  <ARGM-PRD
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
fear*  
you  <ARG1
.  

Good  
luck  
with  
your  
puppy  
!  

All  
the  
best  
.  

Put*  
him  <ARG1
in  
dog  
obedience  
school  <ARG2
or  
call*  
a  
professional  
dog  
trainer  <ARG1
.  
:)  

why  
do*  
nt  >>ARGM-NEG
you  >>ARG0
get*  
some  
treats  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
he  >ARG0
loves*  
and  
only  >ARGM-ADV
give*  
him  <ARG2
them  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
does*  
something  <ARG1
right  <ARGM-MNR
.  

or  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
as  
i  >ARG0
saw*  >ARGM-ADV
on  
embarrassing  
pets  <ARG1
on  
tv  <ARGM-MNR
,  
get*  
a  
clicker  
type  
thing  <ARG1
and  
treats  
as  
well  
.  

try*  
to  
train*  
him  >ARG0
to  
heel*  
,  
which  >ARG1
means*  
to  
walk*  
round  
you  <ARG2
before  
he  >>ARG1
needs*  
to  
go*  
on  
a  
leash  <ARG2
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
that  <ARG1
.  

or  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
even  >ARGM-ADV
spray*  
some  
scented*  
spray  <ARG1
on  
the  
leash  <<ARG2
and  
he  >>ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
for  
the  
scent  <ARG1
and  
probably  
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
act*  
quick  
enough  <ARGM-TMP
,  
will  >ARGM-MOD
stay*  
on  
the  
leash  <ARG3
.  

What  
sort  >>ARG1
of  
Hotel  >>ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
I  >>ARG0
expect*  
to  
find*  
in  
New  
Delhi  <ARGM-LOC
/  
Agra  
/  
Varanasi  
for  
rs  <ARGM-ADV
500  
per  
night  
?  

Hey  
guys  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
looking*  
to  
visit*  
India  <ARG1
with  
some  
mates  <ARGM-COM
at  
the  
beginning*  
of  
February  <ARG1
next  
year  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
I  
am*  
wandering  
what  
standard  >>ARG1
of  
accommodation*  
we  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
for  
Rs  <ARG3
500  
per  
person  
per  
night  
.  

There  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
four  <ARG1
of  
us  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0
would  
probably  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
looking*  
at  
2  
twin  
rooms  <ARG1
for  
Rs  
1000  
,  
close  
to  
the  
centre  
of  
these  
cities  
.  

This  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
on  
a  
walk*  
-  
in  
basis  <<ARG2
as  
we  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
have*  
the  
freedom  <ARG1
of  
finding*  
a  
place  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
looks*  
good*  
(  
Not  >ARGM-NEG
relying*  
on  
pictures  <ARG1
from  
the  
internet  
)  
and  
is*  
in  
a  
spot  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
like*  
.  

Thanks*  
in  
advance*  
for  
sharing*  
your  >ARG0
experience*  
!  

Sorry  
,  
almost  >ARGM-ADV
forgot*  
to  
ask*  
-  
Would  >>ARGM-MOD
it  
be*  
cheaper*  
to  
walk*  
-  
in  
to  
these  
hotels  <ARG2
rather  
than  
pre  >ARGM-TMP
book*  
?  

In  
Delhi  >ARGM-LOC
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
Ajay  
Guesthouse  <ARG1
.  

Travelled*  
to  
Delhi  <ARG1
twice  <ARGM-TMP
and  
stayed*  
there  <ARG3
twice  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Rooms  >ARG1
start*  
from  
500  <ARGM-DIR
per  
double  
.  

Those  
ones  >>ARG1
are*  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
small*  
.  

Must  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
,  
in  
Delhi  >>ARGM-LOC
it  
's*  
hard*  
to  
get*  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
price*  
/  
quality  >ARG3
rating*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
found*  
this  
hotel  <ARG1
in  
the  
Lonely  
Planet  
guide  <ARGM-LOC
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
in  
an  
area  >ARG1
starting*  
with  
a  
P  <ARG2
,  
many  
tourist  
hotels  
there  
and  
the  
location  >>ARG1
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
nice*  
.  

But  
in  
general  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Delhi  >ARG1
is*  
the  
hardest  
place  >ARGM-LOC
to  
find*  
a  
nice  
clean  
hotel  <ARG1
for  
that  
price*  
.  

In  
Varanasi  >>ARGM-LOC
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
.  

I  >>ARG1
've*  
stayed*  
in  
a  
more  
expensive  
hotel  <ARG3
there  <ARGM-LOC
,  
but  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
check*  
some  
travelguides  <ARG1
or  
tripadvisor  
?  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
while  
travelling*  >ARGM-TMP
ask*  
people  <ARG2
where  >>ARG2
they  >>ARG1
've*  
been*  
and  
if  
they  >ARG0
have*  
any  
hotel  >ARG1
recommendations*  
.  

In  
Agra  >>ARGM-LOC
I  >>ARG1
've*  
stayed*  
in  
a  
place  >ARG1
fellow  
travellers  >ARG0
recommended*  
,  
they  >ARG0
found*  
it  <ARG1
in  
the  
Rough  
Guide  <ARGM-LOC
.  

It  >>ARG1
was*  
nice*  
and  
close*  
to  
the  
Taj  <ARG2
.  

It  
was*  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
easy*  
to  
find*  
something  <ARG1
.  

(  
Do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
stay*  
in  
Agra  <ARG3
too  
long  <ARGM-TMP
.  

One  
night  >>ARG1
is*  
enough*  
!  
)  

There  
were*  
many  
hotels  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
ve*  
paid*  
500  <ARG1
for  
a  
double  
room  
there  <ARGM-LOC
and  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
fine*  
and  
clean*  
.  

Good  
luck  
,  
enjoy*  
your  
time  <ARG1
!  

You  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
find*  
a  
normal  
budget  
hotel  <ARG1
for  
Rs  <ARGM-ADV
1000  
per  
night  
in  
the  
cities  >ARG1
you  >ARG0

the

To  
Stay*  >>ARGM-PRP
in  
delhi  <ARG3
-  
Hotel  
Aster  
Inn  >>ARG1
is*  
best*  
to  
stay*  
in  
delhi  <ARGM-LOC
.  

it  >ARG1
is*  
in  
karol  
bagh  <ARG2
.  

some  
beautiful  
locations  >ARG1
like  
close  
to  
Karol  
Bagh  
Shopping  
Market  
,  
Presidential  
Palace  
,  
and  
Birla  
Mandir  
Temple  
and  
Connaught  
Place  
and  
Jantar  
Mantar  
are*  
near  <ARG2
to  
it  
.  

TO  
Stay*  >>ARGM-PRP
in  
Agra  <ARG3
-  
Hotel  
Atithi  >>ARG1
and  
Aditya  
Palace  
is*  
perfect*  
for  
you  <ARG2
.  

it  >>ARG1
is*  
centrally  >ARG2
situated*  
.  

To  
Stay*  >ARGM-PRP
in  
Varanasi  <ARG3
-  
Sandeep  
Hotel  >ARG1
is*  
you  >ARG0
choice*  
...  

which  
one  >ARG1
out  
of  
these  
makes*  
the  
best  
pet  <ARG2
?  

a  
degu  
,  
a  
rat  
,  
a  
mouse  
,  
a  
hamster  
or  
a  
guinea  
pig  
?  

and  
why  >ARGM-PRP
is*  
the  
one  <ARG1
a  
better  
pet  <ARG2
?  

Get*  
a  
guinea  
pig  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
hamster  <ARG1
,  
and  
mice  >>ARG0
and  
rats  
like*  
to  
escape*  
.  

The  
Guinea  
pig  >>ARG1
is*  
better*  
because  
it  >>ARG1
s*  
a  
lot  >ARGM-EXT
larger*  
than  
a  
hamster  <ARGM-CXN
,  
rat  
,  
mouse  
,  
or  
degu  
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
if  
you  >ARG0
lose*  >>ARGM-ADV
him  <ARG1
,  
he  >>ARG1
is*  
easier*  
to  
find*  
,  
because  
smaller  
rodents  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
LOVE*  
to  
escape*  
from  
their  
cages  <ARG1
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
my  
opinion  >ARG1
is*  
Guinea  
pigs  <ARG2
.  

(  
plus  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG1
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
stink*  
that  
bad  <ARGM-EXT
)  

Depends*  
on  
what  >>ARG0
you  >ARG0
want*  
in  
a  
pet  <ARG4
,  
to  
be*  
honest*  
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
depends*  
on  
the  
space  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
have*  
,  
how  
much  
time  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
handle*  
the  
pet  <ARG1
,  
how  
much  
money  >ARG3
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
spend*  
,  
etc  
.  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
had*  >ARGM-LVB
experience*  
with  
all  <ARG1
of  
those  
pets  
except  
Degus  
.  

My  
favorite  >>ARG1
would  
have*  
to  
be*  
the  
rat  <ARG2
.  

They  >>ARG1
're*  
incredibly  >ARGM-EXT
social*  
,  
highly  
trainable  
,  
and  
very  >ARGM-EXT
clean*  
.  

Mine  >>ARG0
learned*  
to  
"  
go*  
to  
the  
bathroom  <ARGM-GOL
"  
only  
in  
their  
cages  <ARGM-LOC
and  
loved*  
to  
ride*  
on  
my  
shoulder  <ARG1
or  
hang*  
out  
in  
my  
hoodie  
pouch  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
only  
downside  >ARG1
is*  
they  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
kept*  
in  
pairs  <ARGM-MNR
or  
trios  
and  
require*  
a  
pretty  
large  
habitat  <ARG1
.  

That  >ARG1
means*  
expense  
,  
space  <ARG2
,  
and  
they  >ARG0
require*  
weekly  >ARGM-TMP
cage  >ARG1
cleaning*  
.  

My  
second  
favorite  >>ARG1
would  
have*  
to  
be*  
the  
Guinea  
Pig  >ARG0
-  
not  >ARGM-NEG
quite  >ARGM-EXT
as  >ARGM-CXN
social*  
with  
people  <ARGM-COM
as  
rats  <C-ARGM-CXN
(  
at  >ARGM-ADV
least  
mine  >ARG1
was*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
)  
but  
more  
so  
than  
most  
hamsters  
or  
mice  
.  

Again  
,  
pairs  
or  
trios  
and  
pretty  
big  
living  
space  
.  

They  >>ARG1
,  
too  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
need*  
weekly  >ARGM-TMP
cage  >ARG1
cleaning*  
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
cost*  
quite  
a  
bit  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
handle*  
my  
mice  <ARG1
,  
but  
they  >>ARG0
where*  
skittish  <ARG2
and  
preferred*  
their  
cage  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
never  >ARGM-TMP
met*  
a  
hamster  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
bite*  
me  <ARG1
.  

Never  >>ARGM-NEG
had*  
/  
handled*  
a  
Degu  <ARG1
.  

Get*  
a  
guinea  
pig  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
have*  
two  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG1
are*  
social*  
and  
like*  
to  
be*  
handled*  
.  

You  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
have*  
two  <ARG1
because  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
well  <ARGM-MNR
alone  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Make*  
certain*  
you  >ARG0
get*  
two  
females  <ARG1
.  

Two  
males  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
fight*  
and  
you  >>ARG0
definitely  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
babies  <ARG1
!!  

Guinea  
pigs  >>ARG0
(  
also  >ARGM-ADV
called*  
cavies  <ARG2
)  
are*  
gentle  
creatures  <ARG2
and  
are*  
awake*  
during  
the  
day  <ARGM-TMP
and  
sleep*  
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
whistle*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
hear*  
you  <ARG2
as  
an  
encouragement*  
for  
you  >ARG0
to  
give*  
them  <ARG2
a  
treat  <ARG1
like  
leaf  
lettuce  
.  

They  >ARG0
love*  
leaf  
or  
romaine  
lettuce  <ARG1
and  
tomatos  
,  
celery  
,  
cucumbers  
,  
carrots  
.  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
feed*  
them  <ARG2
broccoli  <ARG1
,  
cauliflower  
,  
garlic  
,  
onions  
,  
head  
lettuce  
....  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
all  >ARGM-ADV
too  >ARGM-CXN
difficult*  
for  
them  >ARG0
to  
digest*  
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
eat*  
potatos  <ARG1
,  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
toxic*  
for  
them  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
keep*  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
cage  >ARG1
clean*  
they  >>ARG1
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
smell*  
and  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
buy*  
spray*  
on  <ARGM-DIR
cleaser  <ARG1
for  
them  <<ARG4
,  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
massage*  
it  <ARG1
into  
their  
coat  <ARGM-DIR
and  
groom*  
them  <ARG1
.  

Fostering*  
6  
week  
old  
kittens  <ARG1
and  
HATING*  
IT  <ARG1
!  

Need*  
Advice  <ARG1
!?  

I  >>ARG0
wanted*  
to  
volunteer*  
and  
help*  
animals  <ARG1
,  
and  
decided*  
to  
try*  
fostering*  
kittens  <ARG1
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
my  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
experience*  
and  
I  >>ARG1
have*  
two  
six  
week  
old  
kittens  <ARG1
right  
now  <ARGM-TMP
and  
am*  
at  
my  
wit  >ARG1
s  
end*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
have*  
to  
bring*  
them  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
before  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
eight  
weeks  >ARG2
old*  
but  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
ruining*  
my  
apartment  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
track*  
poop  <ARG1
everywhere  <ARGM-LOC
(  
most  
disgustingly  
my  
bed  <ARGM-LOC
....  
)  
,  
and  
am*  
constantly  >ARGM-TMP
trying*  
to  
climb*  
up  <ARGM-DIR
everything  <ARG1
,  
including  
my  
bare  
legs  
!  

My  
legs  >>ARG1
and  
hands  
are*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
full*  
of  
scratches  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
realize*  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
young*  
and  
that  
cats  >>ARG0
do*  
climb*  
,  
but  
this  >ARG1
is*  
just  
ridiculous  <ARG2
.  

My  
apartment  >ARG1
also  >ARGM-DIS
smells*  
repulsive  <ARG2
even  
though  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
cleaning*  
out  
their  
litter  
box  <ARG1
at  
least  
once  <ARGM-TMP
a  
day  
if  
not  
twice  
.  

Any  
suggestions*  >>ARG1
and  
helpful  >ARGM-ADJ
hints*  >ARG0
to  
make*  
this  <ARG1
a  
more  
positive  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
extremely  >ARGM-ADV
appreciated*  
.  

That  >ARG1
's*  
kind  <ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
it  >ARG1
goes*  
..  
lol  <<ARGM-DIS
.  

Limit*  
them  >ARG0
to  
one  
room  <ARG2
with  
easy  
to  
clean*  
flooring  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
have*  >ARGM-ADV
limited  
options  <ARG1
,  
try*  
the  
bathroom  <ARG1
.  

Make*  
sure*  
there  
are*  
plenty  <ARG1
of  
litter  
boxes  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are*  
cleaned*  
often  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Depending  
on  
the  
batch  >ARGM-ADV
of  
kittens  
,  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
often  >ARGM-TMP
have*  
as  
many  <ARG1
as  
one  
per  
kitten  
.  

They  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
produce*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
waste*  
and  
even  >ARGM-ADV
scooping*  >ARGM-ADV
twice  
a  
day  <ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
messy  <ARG2
.  

For  
some  
reason  >ARGM-CAU
it  
takes*  
them  >>ARG1
awhile  <ARG1
to  
learn*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
step*  
in  
poop  <ARG2
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
if  
they  >ARG0
have*  >ARGM-ADV
diarrhea  <ARG1
,  
check*  
in  
with  
your  
foster  
coordinator  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
made  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
medication*  
or  
deworming*  
or  
something  
.  

They  >>ARG0
are*  
testing*  
out  <ARGM-ADV
their  
claws  <ARG1
and  
teeth  
.  

To  
some  
degree  >ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
/  
should  >ARGM-MOD
help*  
teach*  
them  >ARG0
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
use*  
their  
teeth  <ARG1
and  
claws  
inappropriately  <ARGM-MNR
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
in  
the  
meantime  >ARGM-TMP
,  
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
jeans  <ARG1
and  
long  
sleeves  
anytime  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
interacting*  
with  
the  
kittens  <ARG1
.  

Then  >>ARGM-DIS
take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
yourself  <ARG1
.  

Get*  
plenty  <ARG1
of  
sleep  
and  
make*  
sure*  
you  >>ARG0
take*  
time  <ARG1
out  
to  
do*  
some  
things  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
enjoy*  
.  

Try*  
visiting*  
the  
kittens  <ARG1
a  
few  
times  <ARGM-TMP
a  
day  
for  
short  
periods  <ARGM-TMP
of  
time  
.  

Try*  
to  
go*  
in  
there  <ARG4
with  
the  
right  
frame  <ARGM-MNR
of  
mind  
and  
enjoy*  
them  <ARG1
for  
what  >ARG2
they  >ARG1
are*  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
enjoy*  >ARGM-ADV
the  
kittens  <ARG1
,  
see*  
what  
other  
opportunities  >>ARG2
are*  
available*  
.  

They  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
foster  
homes  <ARG1
for  
adult  
cats  >>ARG0
in  
different  
situations  
..  
sick  
,  
recovering*  
from  
surgery  <ARG2
,  
need*  
a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
socialization*  
,  
etc  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
find*  
the  
adults  >>ARG1
are*  
much  >ARGM-EXT
easier*  
.  

Generally  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
're*  
not  >>ARGM-NEG
clawing*  
and  
biting*  
,  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
make*  
nearly  
as  
much  
mess  <ARG1
,  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
need*  
nearly  
as  
much  >ARGM-ADV
litterbox  >ARG1
scooping*  
,  
etc  
:)  

Decide*  
volunteering*  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
your  
thing  <ARG2
and  
give*  
them  <ARG1
back  <C-V
!  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
do*  >ARGM-LVB
more  >ARGM-EXT
research*  
before  
you  >ARG0
agree*  
next  
time  <ARGM-TMP
;-)  

Take*  
the  
kittens  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
to  
the  
shelter  
.  

Maybe  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
volunteer  >ARG0
work*  
at  
the  
humane  
society  <<ARGM-LOC
,  
walk*  
dogs  <ARG1
,  
groom*  
the  
animals  <ARG1
etc  <ARGM-ADV
.  

what  >ARG2
r*  
the  
requirements*  
to  
apply*  
for  
a  
delay  
birth  
certificate  <ARG1
in  
canada  <ARGM-LOC
?  

what  >ARG2
r*  
the  
evidentary  >ARGM-ADJ
requirements*  
to  
apply*  
for  
a  
delay  
birth  
certificate  <ARG1
in  
canada  <ARGM-LOC
?  

including  
fees  
and  
forms  

It  >ARG0
depends*  
on  
if  
you  >ARG0
ever  >ARGM-TMP
registered*  
the  
birth*  
.  

Some  
places  >ARG0
do*  
the  
registration  <ARG1
right  
at  
the  
hospital  <ARGM-LOC
....  
in  
some  
smaller  
places  >ARGM-LOC
,  
you  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
register*  
your  
child  >ARG1
's  
birth*  
at  
the  
town  
hall  <<ARGM-LOC
/  
registrar  
's  
office  
.  

My  
first  
three  
children  >>ARG1
were*  
born*  
in  
Southern  
Ontario  
cities  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
birth  >ARG1
registration*  >>ARGM-PRR
was*  
done*  
right  
in  
hospital  
.  

My  
last  
son  >>ARG1
,  
was*  
born*  
in  
Northern  
Ontario  <ARGM-LOC
....  

I  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
that  
I  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
register*  
him  <ARG1
in  
the  
ridiculous  
amount  <ARGM-MNR
of  
paperwork  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
had*  
filled*  
out  
in  
the  
hospital  <ARGM-LOC
and  
was*  
supposed*  
to  
go*  
to  
city  
hall  <ARG4
within  
90  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Two  
years  
later  >>ARGM-TMP
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
got*  >>ARGM-TMP
around  <ARGM-PRD
to  
filling*  
for  
his  
birth  
certificate  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
find*  
out  
he  >>ARG1
was*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
registered*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
call*  
the  
Office  <ARG1
of  
the  
Registrar  
General  
in  
Thunder  
Bay  
,  
have*  
copies*  >ARG1
of  
the  
delayed  
registration  
form  <ARG1
mailed*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
to  
me  <ARG2
,  
as  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
an  
online  
area  <ARG1
for  
it  
yet  <ARGM-TMP
,  
fill*  
those  <ARG1
out  <C-V
,  
send*  
them  <ARG1
away  <ARGM-DIR
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
apply*  
for  
his  
birth  
certificate  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
applying*  >>ARGM-ADV
for  
a  
birth  
certificate  <ARG1
for  
the  
first  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
it  
s*  
simple*  
to  
do*  
it  <ARG1
over  
the  
computer  <ARG3
.  

For  
$  >>ARG3
56  
you  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
even  >ARGM-ADV
have*  
it  >ARG1
expedited*  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
in  
three  
business  
days  <ARGM-TMP
or  
your  
money  
back  
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
in  
Ontario  <ARG2
of  >>ARGM-ADV
course  
,  
the  
rates  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
slightly  >ARGM-EXT
different*  
for  
other  
provinces  <ARG3
/  
territories  
.  

You  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
need*  
basic  
information  <ARG1
,  
and  
answer*  
a  
few  
questions  <ARG1
like  
what  
hospital  >>ARGM-LOC
was*  
the  
child  >ARG1
born*  
at  <C-ARGM-LOC
/  
who  >ARG1
was*  
the  
doctor  <ARG2
....  

None  
,  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
walk*  
in  
to  
the  
service  
office  <ARG2
and  
present*  
all  
the  
identification*  
you  
have*  
to  
prove*  
your  
identity  <ARG1
.  

they  >>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
then  >>ARGM-ADV
chose*  
to  
ask*  
you  >ARG0
to  
bring*  
more  
evidence  <ARG1
,  
or  
just  >ARGM-ADV
look*  
up  
the  
record  <ARG1
and  
hand*  
you  <ARG2
the  
certificate  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
do*  
it  <ARG1
all  
on  
-  
line  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Start*  
here  <ARGM-LOC
if  
you  >>ARG1

Good  
luck  

My  
parents  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
send*  
for  
my  
birth  
certificate  <ARG1
until  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
16  <ARG2
and  
needed*  
it  <ARG1
for  
summer  >ARGM-TMP
employment*  
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
no  
problem  >ARG1
to  
get*  
PROVIDED  
the  
birth*  >>ARG1
was*  
registered*  
in  
the  
first  
place  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
add*  
that  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
because  
there  
have*  
been*  
some  
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
have*  
tried*  
to  
claim*  
citizenship  <ARG1
by  
sending*  
for  
their  
birth  
certificate  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG1
were*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-ADV
born*  
in  
Canada  <ARGM-LOC
or  
to  
Canadian  
parents  
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
child  >>ARG1
is*  
born*  >>ARGM-TMP
in  
Canada  <ARGM-LOC
the  
birth*  >>ARG1
is*  
registered*  
before  
the  
baby  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
leave*  
the  
hospital  <ARG1
.  

As  
long  >>ARGM-ADV
as  
that  >>ARG1
was*  
done*  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
send*  
for  
it  <ARG2
at  
any  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Each  
provincial  
government  >ARG0
has*  
a  
website  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
lists*  
the  
process*  
for  
that  
Province  <ARGM-PRP
so  >>ARGM-ADV
depending  
upon  
where  >>ARGM-LOC
you  >>ARG1

you  >ARG0

Carnival  >ARG1
and  
Royal  
Caribbean  
are*  
two  
popular  
cruise  
lines  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
have*  
strong  >ARGM-ADJ
followings*  
.  

Some  
cruise  
aficionados  >>ARG0
refuse*  
to  
sail*  
on  
one  <ARG1
or  
the  
other  
.  

Are*  
there  
any  
major  >ARGM-EXT
differences*  
between  
them  <ARG1
?  

Explore*  
which  
cruise  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
fit*  
your  >ARG0
needs*  
the  
best  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

For  
our  >ARG0
comparison*  >ARGM-PRP
we  >ARG0
sailed*  
on  
two  
similar  
ships  <ARG1
-  
the  
Carnival  
Liberty  
and  
the  
Royal  
Caribbean  
Mariner  
of  
the  
Seas  
.  

Itinerary  
Both  
ships  >ARG1
go*  
to  
Caribbean  
Islands  <ARG4
like  
Jamaica  
,  
Grand  
Cayman  
,  
Cozumel  
,  
St.  
Thomas  
,  
the  
Bahamas  
and  
St.  
Martin  
/  
St.  
Maarten  
.  

The  
Liberty  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
visited*  
its  
private  
island  <ARG1
Half  
Moon  
Cay  
,  
Puerto  
Rico  
,  
and  
Grand  
Turk  
.  

The  
Mariner  >ARG0
of  
the  
Seas  
traveled*  
to  
its  
private  
island  <ARG1
Coco  
Cay  
and  
Labadee  
(  
the  
north  
coast  
of  
Haiti  
)  
.  

We  >>ARG0
loved*  
most  <ARG1
of  
the  
locations  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
both  >ARG0
of  
the  
ships  
visited*  
and  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
believe*  
that  
this  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
distinguishing  
factor  <ARG2
on  
deciding*  
between  
the  
cruise  
lines  <ARG1
.  

Shows*  
Each  
night  >ARGM-TMP
there  
are*  
a  
variety  <ARG1
of  
shows*  
.  

Usually  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
have*  
the  
main  >ARGM-ADJ
show*  
and  
some  
type  
of  
entertainment  
before  
and  
perhaps  
afterward  
.  

We  >ARG0
felt*  
that  
the  
main  >ARGM-ADJ
shows*  >>ARG1
on  
the  
Mariner  <ARG1
of  
the  
Seas  
were*  
better*  
.  

On  
the  
Liberty  >ARGM-LOC
we  >ARG0
liked*  
the  
comedian  <ARG1
and  
juggling  
act  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
love*  >>ARGM-ADV
seeing*  
the  
shows*  
,  
Royal  
Caribbean  >>ARG1
was*  
better*  
for  
the  
main  >ARGM-ADJ
shows*  
and  
Carnival  >>ARG1
was*  
slightly  >ARGM-EXT
better*  
for  
the  
comedians  <ARG2
.  

Dining  
Room  
We  >ARG0
enjoyed*  
the  
atmosphere  <ARG1
of  
both  
dining  
rooms  
on  
the  
Liberty  
and  
Mariner  
of  
the  
Seas  
.  

We  >ARG0
felt*  
that  
the  
menu  >ARG0
had*  
a  
little  
more  
variety  <ARG1
on  
the  
Mariner  
of  
the  
Seas  
.  

Friendliness  
of  
staff  
The  
Liberty  >ARG0
and  
Mariner  
of  
the  
Seas  
both  
get*  
high  
grades  <ARG1
.  

We  >>ARG0
did*  
have*  
one  
waiter  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
complained*  
some  <ARGM-EXT
on  
one  <ARGM-TMP
of  
our  >ARG0
trips*  
on  
the  
Mariner  <ARGM-MNR
.  

We  >>ARG0
had*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
slightly  
better  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
on  
the  
Liberty  <ARGM-LOC
,  
but  
feel*  
that  
both  
crews  >ARG0
did*  
an  
excellent  
job  <ARG1
and  
that  
this  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
a  
distinguishing  
factor  <ARG2
on  
choosing*  
a  
cruise  <ARG1
.  

Pools  
The  
Mariner  >ARG0
of  
the  
Seas  
and  
Liberty  
both  
had*  
salt  
water  
pools  >ARG1
-  
which  >R-ARG1
most  
cruise  
ships  >ARG0
have*  
.  

They  >ARG0
both  
had*  
pools  <ARG1
for  
kids  
and  
adults  
.  

We  >ARG0
liked*  
the  
Liberty  
's  
pools  <ARG1
better  <ARGM-EXT
because  
one  >ARG0
had*  
a  
slide  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
have*  >ARGM-ADV
kids  <ARG1
,  
this  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
something  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
enjoy*  
.  

Spa  
We  >>ARG0
tried*  
the  
spa  <ARG1
on  
the  
Liberty  
and  
loved*  
it  <ARG1
.  

We  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
try*  
the  
spa  <ARG1
on  
the  
Mariner  
of  
the  
Seas  
.  

Usually  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
wrong  <ARGM-MNR
when  >ARGM-TMP
getting*  
a  
spa  >ARG2
treatment*  
......  

Royal  
Caribbean  >>ARG1
is*  
better*  
,  
but  
the  
best  
cruiseline  >ARG1
is*  
Regent  
Seven  
Seas  <ARG2
.  

Look*  
on  
their  
website  <ARG1
rssc.com  

Royal  
Caribbean  
.  

Carnival  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
called*  
the  
WalMart  <ARG2
of  
cruise  
lines  
...  

What  
countries  >ARG2
are*  
the  
best  >ARG1
to  
travel*  
to  <C-ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
want*  
to  
travel*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
leave*  
school  <ARG1
!  

Where  >ARG4
in  
the  
states  
could  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
go*  
?  

Where  
in  
Europe  
?  

Have*  
you  >ARG0
every  >ARGM-TMP
traveled*  
before  <ARGM-TMP

How  
long  >ARGM-TMP
should  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
go*  
for  <C-ARGM-TMP
to  
each  
place  <ARG4
?  

(  
I  >ARG0
Have*  
1  
year  <ARG1
before  
collage  <ARGM-TMP
!  
)  

&  >ARGM-DIS
Also  
how  
much  
money  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
need*  
?  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
start*  
saving*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
hehe  <<ARGM-DIS

Thanks*  
:)  

I  >ARG0
mean*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
graduate*  
&  
yes  
,  
college  
,  
sorry  
for  
the  
typo  
.  

Leave*  
High  
School  <ARG1
?  

Not  
the  
smartest  >ARGM-ADJ
move*  
to  
take*  
off  
on  
a  
worldly  >ARG1
adventure*  
if  
you  >>ARG0
've*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
traveled*  
before  <ARGM-TMP
and  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
put*  
where  >>ARG2
you  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
traveling*  
from  <C-ARG2
.  

In  
the  
United  
States  
?  

Lots  
of  
places  
.  

There  
are*  
50  <ARG1
of  
them  
,  
48  >ARG1
located*  
from  
Maine  <ARGM-LOC
to  
Florida  
and  
California  
to  
Washington  
State  
and  <ARGM-LOC
all  
in  
between  <ARGM-LOC
.  

There  
are*  
2  
more  >ARG1
located*  
outside  
of  
the  
main  
continent  <ARGM-LOC
with  
Alaska  <ARGM-ADV
way  
to  
the  
north  
and  
Hawaii  
in  
the  
Pacific  
.  

What  >>ARG1
do*  
you  >>ARG0
like*  
to  
do*  
?  

Big  
Cities  
like  
New  
York  
,  
Boston  
,  
Philadelphia  
on  
the  
East  
Coast  
.  

Beaches  
and  
Disney  
of  
Florida  
or  
the  
Mid  
Atlantic  
cities  
of  
Atlanta  
,  
Savannah  
,  
Charleston  
.  

The  
federal  
sites  
of  
Washington  
,  
DC  
.  

Southern  
charm  
of  
Nashville  
,  
Birmingham  
,  
New  
Orleans  
or  
Charlotte  
.  

West  
Coast  
hot  
spots  
like  
Seattle  
,  
Portland  
,  
San  
Francisco  
,  
Los  
Angeles  
or  
San  
Diego  
.  

Europe  
?  

Just  
as  
numerous  
as  
the  
possibilities  
of  
the  
US  
.  

Do*  
you  >ARG0
speak*  
a  
foreign  
language  <ARG1
?  

I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
spend*  
a  
year  <ARG1
in  
Spain  <ARGM-LOC
alone  
.  

From  
Madrid  
to  
Seville  
to  
Barcelona  
an  
Valencia  
.  

Bilboa  
on  
the  
north  
coast  
,  
Pamplona  
and  
the  
very  
famous  
Guernica  
.  

A  
road  >ARGM-MNR
trip*  
to  
Lisbon  <ARG1
and  
the  
Algarve  
in  
Portugal  
before  
a  
mountain  >ARGM-GOL
escape*  
in  
the  
Pyrenees  <ARGM-LOC
and  
a  
stop*  
in  
Andorra  <ARGM-LOC
before  
heading*  
over  <ARGM-DIR
to  
France  <ARG1
and  
Italy  
and  
Austria  
and  
Switzerland  
.  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
traveled*  
to  
all  <ARG1
of  
these  
places  
and  
could  >ARGM-MOD
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
tailor*  
a  
trip*  
to  
your  >ARG0
needs*  
based  
on  
budget  <ARGM-ADV
,  
actual  
time  >ARG1
allowed*  
,  
your  
likes  
and  
dislikes  
.  

Amount  >>ARG0
of  
time  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
dependent*  
on  
so  
many  
things  <ARG1
.  

Do*  
you  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
see*  
all  
the  
sites  <ARG1
or  
simply  
a  
few  >ARGM-ADJ
photos*  
and  
on  
your  >ARG0
way*  
to  
the  
next  
place  <ARG1
.  

Does*  
your  
budget  >ARG0
limit*  
you  <ARG1
to  
how  
long  >ARGM-EXT
you  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
stay*  
in  
each  
place  <ARG3
?  

You  >ARG0
need*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
money  
for  
hotels  
,  
airfare  
,  
seeing*  
the  
sites  <ARG1
,  
food  
,  
local  >ARGM-LOC
transport*  
-  
you  >ARG0
name*  
it  <ARG1
but  
life  >ARG1
costs*  
.  

Once  
you  >ARG0
have*  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
budget  <ARG1
or  
an  
amount  
in  
the  
bank  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
figure*  
out  
where  >ARG4
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
,  
for  
how  
long  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
and  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
're*  
there  <ARG2
.  

1  
year  
before  
collage  
or  
college  
?  

Good  
luck  
.  

I  >ARG0
recommend*  
buying*  
a  
single  
unlimited  
Europass  <ARG1
and  
travelling*  
anywhere  >ARG1
in  
the  
EU  
your  
heart  >ARG0
desires*  
.  

You  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
beat*  
the  
price*  
for  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
get*  
.  

come*  
to  
Africa  <ARG4
.  

Nigeria  
,  
a  
lovely  
country  
.  

But  
where  
in  
nigeria  
?  

Obudu  
cattle  
ranch  
.  

More  
than  
a  
tourist  
centre  
.  

How  >>ARGM-MNR
do*  
you  >ARG0
make*  
your  
cat  >ARG1
adjust*  
to  
a  
new  
house  <ARG2
?  

Me  >>ARG1
and  
my  
family  
are*  
moving*  
into  
a  
new  
house  <ARG2
just  
outside  
a  
small  
town  <ARGM-LOC
.  

We  >>ARG0
are*  
currently  >ARGM-TMP
living*  
a  
mile  <ARGM-LOC
from  
the  
town  
in  
a  
house  >ARG2
surrounded*  
by  
fields  <ARG1
but  
the  
new  
house  >ARG1
is*  
beside  
a  
busy  
road  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG0
have*  
had*  
the  
cat  <ARG1
for  
10  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
leave*  
it  <ARG1
.  

How  >ARGM-MNR
could  >ARGM-MOD
we  >ARG0
make*  
it  >ARG1
settle*  
in  
a  
new  
house  <ARGM-LOC
.  

you  >>ARG0
are*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADV
moving*  
house  <ARG1
-  
your  
cat  >>ARG0
is*  
losing*  
his  
territory  <ARG1
.  

territory  >>ARG1
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
important*  
to  
cats  <ARG2
,  
and  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
nervous*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
go*  
into  
a  
new  
place  <ARG4
-  
a  
new  
house  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
full*  
of  
predators  <ARG2
,  
or  
unknown  
menaces  
-  
well  >ARGM-DIS
at  >ARGM-ADV
least  
he  >ARG0
thinks*  
so  <ARG1
.  

you  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
to  
give*  
him  >ARG0
only  
a  
small  
place  >ARG1
to  
explore*  
,  
so  
he  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
make*  
it  <ARG1
his  
territory  <ARG1
,  
and  
feel*  
safe*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

then  >ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
a  
place  >ARGM-LOC
to  
retreat*  
to  <C-ARGM-LOC
when  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG1
feels*  
scared*  
.  

you  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
to  
get*  
his  
box  <ARG1
and  
bowls  
,  
and  
whatever  
blanket  >>ARG1
and  
toys  
are*  
his  <ARG2
,  
and  
smell*  
like  
home  <ARG2
,  
and  
put*  
him  <ARG1
in  
a  
room  <ARG2
.  

the  
room  >>ARG1
you  >ARG0
sleep*  
in  <C-ARGM-LOC
is*  
best*  
(  
seeing*  >>ARG0
you  <ARG1
so  
relaxed  <ARG1
that  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
sleeping*  
will  >ARGM-MOD
send*  
the  
message  <ARG1
that  
everything  >ARG1
is*  
OK  <ARG2
)  
,  
but  
others  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
work*  
just  
as  <ARGM-MNR
well  
.  

close*  
the  
door  <ARG1
,  
and  
keep*  
him  <ARG1
in  
there  <ARG2
for  
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
.  

he  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
feel*  
much  >ARGM-CXN
safer*  
in  
that  
one  
room  <ARGM-LOC
,  
than  
in  
a  
huge  
unknown  
house  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

he  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
explore*  
the  
room  <ARG1
,  
mark*  
everything  <ARG2
with  
his  
cheek  <ARG3
,  
and  
try*  
to  
make*  
it  >ARG1
feel*  
like  
his  
territory  <ARGM-PRD
.  

he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
reassure*  
himself  <ARG1
that  
no  
other  
animal  >ARG1
is*  
in  
there  <ARG2
,  
and  
that  
no  
other  
animal  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
come*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
-  
he  >>ARG0
is*  
afraid*  
that  
he  >ARG1
is*  
in  
someone  
else  
's  
territory  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG1
is*  
in  
a  
new  
house  <ARG2
.  

in  
a  
week  
's  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
he  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
made*  
it  <ARG1
his  <ARG1
,  
and  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
getting*  
more*  >ARGM-CXN
bored*  
than  
afraid  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

let*  
him  <ARG1
out  <ARG1
for  
half  
an  
hour  <ARGM-TMP
,  
to  
explore*  
.  

then  >ARGM-TMP
put*  
him  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
in  <ARG2
.  

he  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
freaked*  
out  
,  
so  >>ARGM-DIS
going*  >ARG0
back  <ARG4
to  
his  
territory  
will  >ARGM-MOD
make*  
him  >ARG1
much  >ARGM-EXT
happier*  
.  

extend*  
the  
time  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG1
is*  
out  <ARG2
each  
day  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
for  
the  
first  
month  >ARGM-TMP
,  
always  >ARGM-TMP
put*  
him  <ARG1
in  
his  
room  <ARG2
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  
he  >>ARG0
feels*  
safe*  
to  
sleep*  
.  

soon  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
make*  
the  
whole  
house  <ARG1
his  <ARG1
,  
but  
he  >>ARG0
needs*  
that  
one  
safe  
place  >ARGM-DIR
to  
start*  
from  <C-ARGM-DIR
.  

remember*  
to  
visit*  
with  
him  <ARG1
while  
he  >ARG1
is*  
in  
the  
room  <ARG2
,  
and  
tell*  
him  <ARG2
how  
good  >ARG2
he  >ARG1
is*  
.  

remember*  
to  
give*  
him  <ARG2
the  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
needs*  
to  
feel*  
that  
the  
room  >ARG1
is*  
his  <ARG2
-  
rush*  
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
he  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
afraid*  
of  
the  
whole  
house  <ARG1
for  
a  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

he  >>ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
even  >ARGM-ADV
start*  
peeing*  
on  
things  <ARGM-LOC
in  
fear*  
.  

good  
luck  
with  
your  
new  
house  
and  
with  
his  
new  
territory  
!  

Let*  
her  >ARG0
explore*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG1
moved*  
my  
cat  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
explore*  
the  
entire  
house  <ARG1
before  
she  >ARG0
felt*  
comfortable  <ARG1
.  

In  
time  >ARGM-TMP
though  >ARGM-ADV
she  >ARG0
/  
he  
will  >ARGM-MOD
adjust*  
.  
:)  

they  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
do*  
it  <ARG1
on  
their  
own  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
adopted*  
a  
2  
year  
old  
male  
German  
Shepherd  <ARG1
with  
Major  
bad  
behaviors  
?  

Last  
night  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
adopted*  
a  
2  
year  
old  
Male  
German  
Shepherd  <ARG1
.  

(  
He  >ARG1
is*  
92  
pounds  <ARG2
)  
He  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
listen*  
to  
any  
commands  <ARG1
,  
but  
my  
major  
problem  >ARG1
is*  
that  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
outside  <ARG4
on  
command  <ARGM-MNR
,  
or  
even  
with  
me  
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
walk*  
outside  <ARG2
and  
he  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
stand*  
at  
the  
door  <ARG2
and  
stare*  
at  
me  <ARG1
or  
run*  
away  <ARGM-DIR
.  

My  
other  
MAJOR  
problem  >ARG1
is*  
that  
he  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
in  
his  
crate  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
get*  
a  
treat  <ARG1
and  
try*  
to  
get*  
him  <ARG1
in  
there  <ARG1
that  
way*  
,  
it  >ARG1
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
work*  
.  

He  >ARG1
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
get*  
close  <ARG2
to  
the  
crate  
.  

If  
I  >ARG1
come*  >ARGM-ADV
towards  
him  <ARGM-DIR
,  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
run*  
away  <ARGM-DIR
.  

How  >>ARGM-MNR
do*  
I  >ARG0
train*  
him  <ARG2
to  
feel*  
comfortable  <ARG1
in  
his  
crate  <ARGM-LOC
?  

and  
to  
willingly  >ARGM-MNR
go*  
outside  <ARG4
...  
and  
to  
come*  
on  
command  <ARGM-ADV
.  

He  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
anything  <ARG1
on  
command  <ARGM-CAU
.  

It  >ARG1
s*  
very  
frustrating  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
9  
month  
old  
German  
Shepherd  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
raised*  
from  
a  
puppy  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
trained*  
her  <ARG2
myself  <ARGM-REC
.  

She  >>ARG1
is*  
crate  
trained  <ARG2
,  
potty  
trained  
,  
and  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
sit*  
,  
lay*  
down  <ARGM-DIR
,  
stay*  
,  
come*  
,  
fetch*  
,  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
even  >ARGM-ADV
stay*  
in  
a  
down  
position  <ARG3
while  
I  >ARG0
throw*  
a  
treat  <ARG1
across  
the  
floor  <ARG2
or  
even  
right  
next  
to  
her  
paw  
,  
and  
she  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
it  <ARG1
until  
I  >>ARG0
give*  >ARGM-LVB
her  >ARG1
the  
command*  
.  

Yes  
,  
lots  
of  
time  
and  
lots  
of  
patients  
...  

I  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
do*  
it  <ARG1
with  
a  
grown  
dog  <ARG4
.  

She  >ARG0
tosses*  
me  <ARG1
around  <ARGM-DIR
like  
it  >ARG1
s*  
nothing  <ARG2
!  

...  
but  >>ARGM-DIS
basically  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
do*  >ARG1
is*  
the  
same  
thing  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
did*  
with  
my  
puppy  <ARG2
...  
lots  
of  
patience  
,  
lots  
of  
time  
,  
lots  
of  
praise*  
,  
lots  
of  
treats  
,  
and  
lots  
of  
repition*  
....  
Right  <<ARGM-DIS
?  

Is*  
there  
any  
tricks*  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
use*  
?  

Maybe  >ARGM-ADV
get*  
a  
book  <ARG1
on  
training*  
.  

You  >>ARG1
have*  
to  
be*  
in  
command  <ARG2
at  
all  
times  <ARGM-TMP
.  

There  
are*  
ways*  >ARGM-MNR
to  
get*  
your  
new  
dog  >>ARG0
used*  
to  
the  
crate  <ARG1
or  
going*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
start*  
with  
a  
leash  <ARG2
.  

Put*  
the  
leash  <ARG1
on  
the  
dog  <ARG2
and  
just  >ARGM-ADV
walk*  
around  
the  
crate  <ARG2
a  
few  
times  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Then  >>ARGM-TMP
take*  
the  
leash  <ARG1
off  <C-V
and  
do*  
nothing  <ARG1
else  
but  
that  
.  

Later  >ARGM-TMP
do*  
it  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
the  
dog  >ARG1
is*  
ok  >>ARGM-TMP
with  
this  
,  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
open*  
the  
door  <ARG1
and  
walk*  
around  
the  
crate  <ARG2
,  
leave*  
the  
door  >ARG1
open*  
all  
the  
time  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Put*  
something  <ARG1
fun  
inside  <ARG2
.  

Let*  
your  
dog  >ARG0
go*  
in  <ARG4
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
wants*  
to  <ARG1
for  
no  
reason  <ARG1
.  

Do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
shut*  
the  
door  <ARG1
.  

Let*  
him  >ARG0
walk*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
and  
out  
for  
a  
few  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

At  
some  
point  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
feel*  
ok  <ARG1
with  
this  
and  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
then  >ARGM-TMP
close*  
the  
door  <ARG1
but  
not  
for  
long  
at  
all  
.  

Open*  
the  
door  <ARG1
and  
let*  
him  <ARG1
out  <ARG1
and  
see*  
how  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
acts*  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
push*  >ARGM-ADV
it  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
work*  
.  

With  
going*  >>ARGM-ADV
outside  <ARG4
,  
put*  
the  
leash  <ARG1
on  <ARG2
and  
just  >ARGM-ADV
take*  
him  <ARG1
for  
a  
walk*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
learn*  
to  
really  >ARGM-EXT
like*  
this  <ARG1
.  

Potty  >ARG1
outside  
will  >ARGM-MOD
come*  
at  
some  
point  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Try*  
obedience  
classes  <ARG1
.  

Have*  
patience  <ARG1
with  
him  
,  
you  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
got*  
him  <ARG1
and  
who  >ARG0
knows*  
how  >>ARG2
he  >>ARG1
was*  
treated*  
before  
you  >ARG0
brought*  
him  <ARG1
home  <ARG2
.  

where  >ARGM-LOC
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
find*  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
tours*  
to  
the  
Mekong  
Delta  <ARG1
at  
reasonable  >ARGM-ADJ
prices*  
?  

will  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
in  
Ho  
chi  
Minh  <ARG2
for  
4  
days  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >>ARGM-MOD
am*  
looking*  
for  
a  
1  
day  >ARGM-TMP
or  
2  
day  
trip*  
to  
Mekong  
delta  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
researching*  
on  
line  <ARGM-MNR
and  
find*  
things  >ARG1
are*  
quite  
pricey  <ARG2
but  
the  
tours*  >>ARG1
look*  
great*  
.  

Should  >>ARGM-MOD
I  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
settle*  
and  
book*  
on  
line  <ARGM-MNR
?  

or  >>ARGM-DIS
is*  
it  >ARG1
better*  
if  
I  >ARG1
wait*  
till  
I  >ARG1
get*  
there  <ARG2
?  

If  
I  >ARG1
wait*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
the  
tours*  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
find*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
for  
less  
money  <ARGM-ADV
be*  
the  
same  
quality  
type  >ARGM-ADJ
tours*  
?  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
any  
tour  >ARG1
recommendations*  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful*  
a  
well  <ARGM-DIS
.  

Thank*  
you  <ARG1

St.  <ARGM-LOC

I  >>ARG0
have*  
taken*  >ARGM-LVB
this  
tour*  
and  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
great*  
.  

I  >ARG0
did*  
an  
overnight  >>ARG1
in  
a  
home  >ARG3
stay*  
that  >>R-ARG1
was*  
sweet*  
and  
the  
water  
market  >>ARG1
was*  
wonderful*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
remember*  
the  
exact  
cost  <ARG1
but  
remember*  
thinking*  
how  
inexpensive  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
was*  
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS

very  
reputable  <ARG2
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
no  >>ARGM-DIS

I  >>ARG0

not  >ARGM-NEG

:)  

I  >ARG1
am*  
just  <ARGM-ADV
a

And  >>ARGM-DIS
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
expect*  
to  
party*  
on  
this  
tour*  
.  

The  
south  >ARG1

the  
regular

Very  
few  
clubs  
and  
night

Oh

if  
you  >>ARG1

Sinh

have*  >ARGM-LVB

There  
is*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
much  >ARG1
to  
see*  
in  
the  
delta  <<ARGM-LOC
,  
it  >ARG1
's*  
a  
lifestyle  <ARG2
not  
a  
resort  
area  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG1
're*  
adventurous*  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
a  
bus  <ARG1
or  
water  
taxi  
to  
My

From  
either  >>ARGM-ADV

Most  >>ARG0

You  >>ARG0
take*  
a  
boat  <ARG1

then  >ARGM-TMP
spend*  
a  
day  <ARG1
biking*  
,  
eating*  
at  
a  
local  
restaurant  <ARGM-LOC
,  
buying*  
souvenirs  <ARG1
and  
doing*  
other  
things  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are*  
geared*  
towards  
tourists  <ARG2
.  

The  
countryside  >>ARG1
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
beautiful*  
,  
especially  
if  
you  >ARG0
have*  
a  
few  
months  >ARGM-TMP
(  
or  
years  
)  
to

It  >>ARG1
's*  
a

by  
foot  <ARGM-MNR
,  
they  >>ARG0
're*

.  

Have*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
trip*  
where  
-  
ever  >ARG2
you  >ARG1
end*  
up  
.  

We  >ARG0
went*  
with  
Intrepid  <ARGM-COM
as  
a  
part  <ARGM-PRD
of  
their  >ARG0
North  
to  
South  
Vietnam  >ARG1
Trip*  
,  
but  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
offer*  
this  
one  
day  <ARG1
separately  <ARGM-MNR
.  

We  >>ARG0
had*  
a  
great  
time  <ARG1
and  
visited*  
a  
location  >ARGM-LOC
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
they  >ARG0
made*  
coconut  
candies  <ARG1
,  
visited*  
a  
local  
restaurant  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
was*  
attached*  
to  
a  
fish  
farm  <ARG2
,  
rode*  
in  
modified  
quad  
bikes  <ARG1
and  
had*  
some  
tropical  
food  <ARG1
at  
what  >>ARG1
appeared*  
to  
be*  
a  
local  
hangout  <ARG2
.  

Intrepid  >>ARG1
is*  
good*  
at  
getting*  
you  <ARG1
away  <ARG2
from  
the  
most  
touristy  
spots  
and  
showing*  
you  <ARG2
something  <ARG1
a  
little  
different  
.  

yoga  
and  
horses  
.....  
?  

I  >ARG0
got*  
a  
riding  >ARG1
lesson*  
today  <<ARGM-TMP
on  
one  <<ARGM-LOC
of  
my  
boss  
's  
fino  
horses  
and  
it  >ARG0
made*  
me  >ARG0
realize*  
just  
how  
unsteady  >ARG2
my  
left  
leg  >ARG1
is*  
.  

I  >ARG0
mentioned*  
it  <ARG1
to  
my  
boss  <ARG2
and  
she  >>ARG0
said*  
to  
start*  
doing*  >ARGM-LVB
yoga*  
.  

But  
there  
are*  
just  
so  
many  
poses  <ARG1
and  
programs  
!  

Any  
good  
poses  >>ARG0
or  
programs  
(  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
willing*  
to  
buy*  
a  
dvd  <ARG1
as  
long  <<ARGM-ADV
as  
it  >ARG1
is*  
under  
$  <ARG2
20  
)  
to  
help*  
specifically  <ARGM-ADV
with  
leg  >ARG1
stabilization*  
?  

I  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-DIS
have*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
few  >ARGM-ADJ
issues*  
supporting*  
my  
back  <ARG1
and  
my  
left  
leg  >ARG1
flops*  
.  

Because  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
feel*  
like  
spending*  
over  
$  <ARG3
20  
on  
a  
freakin  
DVD  <ARG1

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
have*  
back  
problems  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
transfer*  
into  
my  
legs  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
done*  
Yoga  <ARG1
for  
riders  
for  
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
,  
a  
20  
minute  
routine  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
found*  
on  
YouTube  <ARGM-LOC
(  
I  >ARG0
think*  
it  >>ARG1
s*  
called*  
"  
Yoga  >>ARG1
for  
horse  
back  >ARG1
riding*  
"  
hosted*  
by  
a  
man  <ARG0
)  
It  >ARG0
helped*  
with  
noticing*  
slight  >ARGM-EXT
differences*  
in  
my  
balance  <ARG1
and  
weight  >ARG1
distribution*  
but  
not  
really  
for  
the  
way  >ARGM-MNR
I  >ARG0
use*  
my  
legs  <ARG1
and  
back  
.  

Here  >ARG2
is*  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
do*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
and  
it  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
helps*  
....  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
get*  >>ARGM-TMP
on  <ARGM-DIR
I  >>ARG0
take*  
1  
leg  <ARG1
and  
pull*  
it  <ARG1
back  
up  <ARG2
to  
touch*  
my  
butt  <ARG1
with  
my  
heel  <ARG2
and  
hold*  
it  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
for  
1  
lap  <ARGM-TMP
at  
a  
walk*  
around  
a  
large  
dressage  
arena  <ARG2
.  

Then  
the  
same  
thing  
with  
the  
other  
leg  
.  

Then  
1  
lap  
at  
a  
walk*  
around  
the  
arena  
with  
both  
my  
legs  >ARG1
pulled*  
out  <ARG2
as  
far  <ARG3
as  
I  
can  
,  
so  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
touching*  
the  
saddle  <ARG1
.  

Then  
a  
lap  
doing  
scissors  
,  
one  
leg  
forward  
as  
far  
as  
I  
can  
and  
the  
other  
back  
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
switch*  
legs  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-ADV
trot*  
doing*  
,  
down  >ARGM-DIR
2  
beats*  
,  
up  
one  
for  
a  
wile  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
then  
up  
2  
down  
1  
making*  
sure*  
the  
weight  >>ARG1
is*  
going*  
into  
the  
balls  <ARG4
of  
my  
feet  
.  

If  
the  
weight  >>ARG1
is*  
going*  >>ARGM-ADV
into  
your  
heels  <ARG4
(  
it  >ARG0
throws*  
your  
leg  <ARG1
forward  <ARG2
)  
put*  
the  
stirrups  <ARG1
up  
against  
the  
heel  <ARG2
of  
your  
boot  
.  

Do*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
working  >ARGM-PRD
trot*  
,  
not  
a  
slow  
trot  
.  

All  
this  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
help*  
you  >>ARG0
use*  
both  
legs  <ARG1
evenly  <ARGM-MNR
,  
keep*  >ARGM-LVB
proper  >ARGM-MNR
contact*  
and  
use*  
your  
wight  <ARG1
correctly  <ARGM-MNR
,  
to  
keep*  
your  
leg  <ARG1
in  
a  
good  
position  <ARG2
.  

BTW  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
your  
leg  >ARG1
locked*  
in  
place  <ARGM-LOC
,  
it  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
move*  
WITH  
the  
horse  <ARGM-MNR
a  
bit  <ARGM-EXT
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
started*  >>ARGM-TMP
doing*  
it  <ARG1
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
it  <ARG1
every  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
do*  
it  <ARG1
once  <ARGM-TMP
or  
twice  
a  
week  
or  
as  
needed*  
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
not  
only  >ARGM-NEG
is*  
my  
leg  >ARG1
better*  
,  
but  
my  
back  >>ARG1

would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
bother*  
with  
the  
yoga  <ARG1

sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
my  
back  >ARG0

more  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
flops*  
:/  
work*  
your  
calf

,  
maybe  >>ARGM-ADV
try*  
standing*  
on  
the  
edge  <ARG2
of  
your  >ARG1
steps*  
(  
on  
the  
ball  <<ARGM-MNR
of  
your  
foot  
)  
and  
balance*  
to  
strengthen*  
those  
muscles  <ARG1

You  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
spend*  
more  
than  
$  <ARG3
20  
and  
yet  
you  >ARG0
have*  
an  
expensive  
hobby  <ARG1
like  
riding*  
horses  <ARG1
?  

I  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
help*  
you  <ARG1
.  

What  >ARG1
to  
feed*  
my  
dog  <ARG2
after  
gastroenteritis  <ARGM-TMP
?  

My  
dog  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
sick*  
for  
about  
3  
days  <ARGM-TMP
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >>ARG0
has*  
been*  
having*  
diarheya  <ARG1
everywhere  <ARGM-LOC
and  
he  >>ARG0
began*  
to  
vomit*  
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
thought*  
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
pass*  
until  
he  >>ARG0
started*  
to  
vomit*  
blood  <ARG1
and  
would  
nt  
drink  
any  
water  
.  

I  >ARG0
took*  
him  <ARG1
to  
the  
Animal  
Hospital  <ARG3
and  
they  >ARG0
ran*  
blood  >ARG1
work*  
and  
everything  >>ARG1
came*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
normal*  
.  

No  
pancreatitis  
or  
anything  
abnormal  
.  

The  
vet  >ARG0
said*  
it  >>ARG0
was*  
gastroenteritis  <ARG2
and  
gave*  
him  <ARG2
fluids  <ARG1
under  
his  
skin  
,  
an  
injection*  
of  
nausea  >ARG3
medication*  
along  
with  
some  
take*  
home  <ARG3
antibiotics  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
my  
question  >ARG1
is*  
..  

Is*  
it  <ARG1
normal*  
for  
dogs  >>ARG0
to  
throw*  
up  
blood  <ARG1
while  
having*  
gastroenteritis  <ARG1
?  

and  >ARGM-DIS
will  >ARGM-MOD
these  
antibiotics  >ARG0
help*  
?  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
tryed*  
to  
give*  
him  <ARG2
water  <ARG1
but  
he  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
take*  
it  <ARG1
..  
what  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
i  >ARG0
do*  
?  

i  >>ARG0
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
him  >ARG1
to  
get*  
dehydrated  <ARG2
and  
also  
should  >ARGM-MOD
i  >>ARG0
try*  
to  
give*  
him  <ARG2
a  
little  
bit  <ARG1
of  
food  
?  

...  
Some  
help*  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
great*  
.  

thank*  
you  <ARG1
:)  

They  >>ARG0
did*  
nt  >>ARGM-NEG
take*  >>ARGM-LVB
x*  
-  
rays  >C-V
they  >ARG0
offered*  
them  <ARG1
but  
i  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
could  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
afford*  
any  
more  >ARGM-EXT
treatment*  
.  

I  >ARG0
feel*  
like  
shit  <ARG1
for  
saying*  
that  <ARG1
but  
after  
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
have*  
done*  >>ARGM-TMP
already  <ARGM-TMP
i  >>ARG0
wo  >>ARGM-MOD
nt  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
buying*  
grocerys  <ARG1
for  
the  
next  
few  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
give*  >ARGM-LVB
them  >ARG2
and  
call*  
and  
see*  
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
say*  
.  

Thank*  
you  <ARG1
for  
the  
help*  
.  

Ok  
so  >ARGM-DIS
i  >ARG0
spoke*  
to  
the  
vet  <ARG2
and  
he  >ARG0
said*  
the  >ARG0
give*  
him  <ARG2
white  
rice  <ARG1
and  
boiled  
chicken  
but  
only  
a  
little  
at  
a  
time  
.  

Seince  
he  >ARG0
recieved*  >ARGM-CAU
the  
fluids  <ARG1
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
said*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
worry*  
about  
drinking  
water  <ARG1
for  
at  
least  
a  
couple  <ARGM-TMP
of  
days  
.  

I  >>ARG0
went*  
home  <ARG4
at  
lunch  <ARGM-TMP
to  
check*  
on  
him  <ARG1
and  
he  >>ARG0
is*  
doing*  
1000  
etter  <ARGM-MNR
he  >>ARG0
was*  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
walkin*  
around  <ARGM-DIR
and  
wagin*  
his  
tail  <ARG1
:)  
thanks*  
everbody  <ARGM-DIS
for  
the  
info  <ARG2
it  >>ARG1
s*  
greatly  >ARGM-ADV
appreciated*  
.  

To  
answer*  
your  
questions  <ARG1
in  
order*  
:  

1  
)  
It  
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
normal*  
for  
dogs  >>ARG0
to  
be*  
vomiting*  
,  
much  
less  >ARGM-EXT
to  
have*  
blood  <ARG1
in  
it  <ARGM-LOC
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
vomiting*  >ARGM-ADV
numerous  
times  <ARGM-TMP
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
the  
blood  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
due  
to  
irritation*  
of  
the  
stomach  <ARG1
and  
intestines  
.  

He  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
have*  
Parvovirus  <ARG1
,  
a  
GI  
foreign  
body  
,  
or  
any  
number  
of  
things  
.  

Did*  
your  
vet  >>ARG0
take*  >ARGM-LVB
radiographs*  
(  
x*  
-  
rays  >C-V
)  
?  

2  
)  
Your  
vet  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
prescribe*  
them  <ARG1
if  
they  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
it  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
helpful*  
.  

3  
)  
If  
he  >>ARG1
shows*  >>ARGM-ADV
no  >ARGM-NEG
interest*  
in  
water  <ARG2
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
take*  
him  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
to  
your  
vet  
.  

It  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
due  
to  
nausea  <ARG2
or  
any  
number  
of  
things  
.  

He  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
become*  
severly  
dehydrated  <ARG2
(  
especially  
if  
he  >>ARG0
continues*  
to  
vomit*  
and  
have*  
diarrhea  <ARG1
)  
.  

From  
there  >ARGM-DIR
you  >ARG1
end*  
up  
with  
electrolyte  
imbalances  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
lead*  
to  
heart  
and  
kidney  
problems  <ARG2
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
being*  
dehydrated  >>ARG1
,  
vomiting*  
,  
and  
having*  
diarrhea  <ARG1
just  >>ARGM-ADV
does*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
feel*  
good*  
.  

4  
)  
Call*  
your  
vet  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
discussed*  
a  
bland  >ARGM-ADJ
diet*  
with  
you  <<ARG2
,  
including  
the  
frequency  <<ARGM-ADV
of  
feeding*  
and  
how  
much  >ARGM-EXT
to  
feed*  
at  
each  
sitting*  
.  

It  >ARG1
sounds*  
like  
your  
dog  >>ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
benefit*  
from  
being*  
hospitalized*  
,  
and  
put*  
on  
IV  
fluids  >>ARG0
to  
help*  
his  >ARG1
hydration*  
,  
administer*  
the  
antibiotics  
IV  <ARG1
,  
and  
to  
ensure*  
that  
he  >>ARG1
starts*  
to  
recover*  
.  

You  >>ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
ABSOLUTELY  >ARGM-ADV
call*  
your  
veterinarian  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
immediately  <ARGM-TMP
to  
clarify*  
anything  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0

questions*  
about  <C-ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
have*  
seen*  
your  
pet  <ARG1
,  
and  
are*  
most  >ARGM-ADV
aware*  
of  
his  
condition  <ARG1
.  

No  
one  >>ARG0
online  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
assist*  
you  <ARG1
more  <ARGM-EXT
than  
your  
vet  
can  
.  

You  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
ask*  
your  
vet  <ARG2
these  
questions  <ARG1
.  

Boiled  
WHITE  
rice  
and

chicken

Bland

NO  
SPICES

My  
vet  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
dog  >>ARG0
is*  
vomiting*  >ARGM-TMP
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT
,  
it  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
sign*  
of  
obstruction*  
.  

Did*  
they  >>ARG0
do*  >ARGM-LVB
any  
x*  
-  
rays  >C-V
?  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
if  
vomiting*  >>ARG1
blood  <ARG1
is*  
common*  
with  
this  
ailment  <ARG2
.  

You  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
call*  
your  
vet  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
and  
ask*  
them  <ARG2
what  >>ARG1
is*  
normal*  
or  
not  
.  

French  
dating  
etiquette  
?  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
really  >ARGM-ADV
love*  
to  
hear*  
what  >>ARG1
the  
French  >>ARG0
or  
those  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
had*  
dated*  
the  
French  <ARG1
to  
say*  
something  
about  
this  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
in  
my  
20's  <ARG2
and  
currently  >ARGM-TMP
studying*  
in  
France  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Coming*  >>ARGM-ADV
from  
an  
anglo  
-  
saxon  
country  <ARG3
my  
version  >>ARG1
of  
dating*  
is*  
'  
getting*  
the  
number  <ARG1
,  
asking*  
her  <ARG1
out  <C-V
,  
etc.  
.  
'  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
've*  
read*  
on  
the  
internet  <ARGM-LOC
that  
the  
French  
dating  
etiquette  >>ARG1
is*  
totally  >ARGM-EXT
different*  
.  

For  
them  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
dating*  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
normally  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
meeting*  
in  
groups  <ARGM-MNR
or  
parties*  
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
pairing*  
off  
.  

In  
addition*  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
from  
my  >ARG0
understanding*  >ARGM-ADV
one  
-  
on  
-  
one  
dates  >ARG1
is*  
something  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
comes*  
much  
later  <ARGM-TMP
and  
not  
'  
straight  
-  
away  
'  
like  
us  
anglo  
-  
saxons  
.  

They  >ARG1
are*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
very  
secretive  <ARG2
about  
being*  
in  
a  
relationship*  
.  

They  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
'  
go*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
in  
the  
open  <ARG4
'  
once  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
reached*  
a  
certain  
level  <ARG1
of  
seriousness  
.  

Is*  
it  >ARG1
true*  
?  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
told*  
a  
French  
girl  <ARG2
I  >ARG0
liked*  
her  <ARG1
,  
and  
she  >ARG0
accepted*  
.  

She  >>ARG1
is*  
friendly*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
see*  
each  
other  <ARG1
on  
campus  <ARGM-LOC
.  

She  >>ARG1
is*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
nicer*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG1
are*  
both  <ARGM-ADV
alone*  
.  

However  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG1
are*  
at  
parties*  >>ARGM-TMP
or  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  
are*  
people  <ARG1
around  
she  >>ARG0
seems*  
to  
ignore*  
me  <ARG1
.  

She  >>ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
seems*  
to  
hate*  
it  <ARG1
whenever  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
ask*  
her  <ARG1
out  <C-V
on  
a  
date  <ARG2
,  
to  
the  
point  >ARGM-ADV
she  >ARG0
said*  
stop*  
!  

My  
mind  >ARG0
thinks*  
she  >>ARG0
has*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
interest*  
in  
me  <ARG2
and  
just  >ARGM-ADV
stringing*  
me  <ARG1
along  <ARGM-PRD
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIR
the  
articles  >>ARG0
I  >ARG0
read*  
seemed*  
to  
say*  
the  
contrary  <ARG1
.  

Have*  
I  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-ADV
fallen*  
victim  <ARG2
in  
a  
cultural  
trap  <ARGM-LOC
?  

What  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
have*  
read*  
in  
the  
internet  <ARGM-LOC
is*  
fairly  >ARGM-EXT
accurate*  
but  
of  >>ARGM-ADV
course  
it  >>ARG1
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
fit*  
all  
scenarios  <ARG2
.  

You  >ARG1
are*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
French  <ARG2
for  
a  
start*  
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
"  
rules*  >ARG1
"  
or  
"  
customs  
"  
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
apply*  
to  
you  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
it  
comes*  
to  
entering*  
into  
a  
relationship*  
between  
people  <ARG0
from  
different  
backgrounds  
.  

From  
what  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
say*  
the  
messages  >>ARG1
given*  
by  
this  
girl  <ARG0
are*  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
clear*  
.  

She  >>ARG0
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
stringing*  
you  <ARG1
along  <ARGM-PRD
since  
she  >>ARG0
is*  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
discouraging*  
you  <ARG1
and  
is*  
honest*  >ARG2
enough*  
to  
tell*  
you  >>ARG0
to  
stop*  
asking*  
her  <ARG1
out  <C-V
.  

She  >>ARG1
is*  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
being*  
friendly*  
in  
public  <ARGM-LOC
because  
she  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
offend*  
you  <ARG1
and  
she  >ARG0
treats*  
you  <ARG1
like  
any  
other  
friend  <ARG2
.  

You  >ARG0
said*  
you  >ARG0
liked*  
her  <ARG1
and  
she  >ARG0
accepted*  
it  <ARG1
as  
a  
truth  <ARG3
and  
perhaps  
as  
a  
compliment  
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
mean*  
she  >>ARG0
fancies*  
you  <ARG1
or  
wants*  
to  
pair*  
off  
with  
you  <ARG1
.  

At  
parties*  >>ARGM-LOC
she  >>ARG1
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
be*  
considered*  
in  
any  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
attached*  
to  
you  <ARG2
,  
which  >>ARG1
is*  
consistent*  
.  

Take*  
the  
messages  <ARG1
for  
what  >ARG2
they  >ARG1
are*  
:  
she  >ARG0
has*  
no  
objection*  
in  
you  >ARG1
being*  
pals  <ARG2
at  
uni  
,  
but  
she  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
take*  
matters  <ARG1
further  <ARG3
.  

"  
Non  >ARG1
!  
"  
means*  
"  
non  <ARG2
"  
,  
not  
"  
I  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
consider*  
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
keep*  
you  >ARG1
attached*  
to  
my  
apron  
strings  <ARG2
just  
in  <<ARGM-ADV
case  
.  
"  

Christiane  
gave*  >ARGM-LVB
you  
a  
good  >ARGM-MNR
answer*  
.  

You  >>ARG1
have*  
fallen*  
in  
a  
cultural  >ARG3
misunderstanding*  
.  

What  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
have*  
to  
add*  
is*  
that  
it  
is*  
normal*  
in  
France  <ARGM-LOC
to  
have*  
mixed*  
gender  
groups  <ARG1
of  
friends  
,  
there  
's*  
nothing  <ARG1
unusual  
in  
boys  >ARG1
and  
girls  
being*  
only  
friends  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
is*  
obviously  <ARGM-ADV
what  >ARG1
this  
girl  >ARG0
wants*  
from  
you  <ARG4
.  

She  >ARG0
probably  >ARGM-ADV
finds*  
your  
company  <ARG1
pleasing  <ARG1
as  
a  
friend  <ARGM-PRD
but  
you  >ARG1
are*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
her  >ARG0
choice*  
a  
a  
boyfriend  <ARG1
and  
she  >>ARG0
is*  
trying*  
to  
keep*  
it  <ARG1
on  
a  
friendship  
level  <ARG2
,  
and  
trying*  
to  
make*  
you  >ARG0
understand*  
that  
she  >>ARG0
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
go*  
further  <ARGM-PRD
.  

If  
she  >>ARG1
is*  
nicer*  >>ARGM-ADV
when  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG1
are*  
alone*  
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
it  >ARG1
is*  
because  
in  
public  >ARG0
view*  >>ARGM-ADV
she  >>ARG0
is*  
making*  
sure*  
that  
people  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
that  
you  >ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
her  
boyfriend  <ARG2
.  

You  >>ARG0
do*  
find*  
the  
'  
get*  
the  
number  <ARG1
hop*  
in  
bed  <ARG4
with  
her  <ARGM-COM
'  
but  
be*  
aware*  
that  
they  >ARG0
usually  >ARGM-TMP
have*  
a  
reputation  <ARG1
as  
sluts  
.  

Unfair  
for  
the  
girl  
as  
boys  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
that  
kind  <ARG1
of  
handicap  
,  
but  
that  >ARG1
's*  
the  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
our  
own  
rules  >ARG0
work*  
.  

Should  
have*  
done*  >ARGM-LVB
research*  
before  
you  >ARG0
left*  
.  

Why  >>ARGM-CAU
not  >>ARGM-NEG
just  >>ARGM-ADV
take*  >ARGM-LVB
your  >ARG0
chances*  
and  
do*  
it  <ARG1
your  >ARG0
way*  
?  

True  
or  
false  
:  
being*  
a  
young  
New  
Zealander  >ARG1
means*  
having*  
no  
future  <ARG1
?  

There  
are*  
no  
jobs  <ARG1
in  
this  
country  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
trying*  
to  
make*  
up  
my  
mind  <ARG1
whether  
I  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
move*  
to  
Australia  <ARG2
or  
seek*  
work*  
in  
the  
sex  
industry  <<ARG2
.  

Is*  
there  
a  
future  <ARG1
for  
our  
nation  
's  
youth  
?  

@  
Ryan  
B  
,  

I  >ARG1
'm*  
two  
years  
into  
an  
undergraduate  
degree  <ARG2
.  

Everybody  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
know*  
at  
university  
intends*  
to  
stay*  
at  
uni  <ARG3
for  
as  
long  <ARGM-TMP
as  
possible  <ARGM-TMP
until  
there  
are*  
actually  <ARGM-ADV
jobs  <ARG1
available  
.  

Everybody  >>ARG1
seems*  
to  
flee*  
this  
country  <ARG1
and  
move*  
overseas  <ARG2
,  
to  
Australia  
,  
etc  
.  

There  
's*  
obviously  <ARGM-ADV
a  
reason  <ARG1
for  
that  
(  
lack*  
of  
employment*  
,  
low  
incomes  
,  
etc  
.  
)  

Your  >ARG0
answer*  >>ARG0
does*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
do*  
anything  <ARG1
but  
remind*  
me  <ARG2
that  
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
going*  
to  
be*  
$  
25,000  
in  
debt  <ARG2
by  
the  
time  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
'm*  
22  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
,  
thanks*  
.  

@  
W.a.b.b.y  
,  

I  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
like*  
you're  >ARG0
answer*  
.  

it  >>ARG1
's*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
logical*  
.  

I  >>ARG1
've*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
considered*  
becoming*  
a  
teacher  <ARG2
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
's*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
job  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG2
'm*  
cut*  
out  
for  <C-ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIR
wish*  
I  >>ARG0
'd*  
applied*  
for  
a  
scholarship  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
I  >>ARG2
'd  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
awarded*  
one  <ARG1
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
received*  
the  
Dux  
Litterarum  >ARG1
award*  
at  
high  
school  <<ARGM-LOC
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
my  >ARG0
chances*  >>ARG1
were*  
probably  >ARGM-ADV
better*  
than  
I  >ARG0
thought*  
they  >ARG1
were*  
.  

Obviously  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
completely  >ARGM-EXT
stupid*  
though  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
mean*  
,  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
smart*  
enough  <ARGM-CXN
to  
apply*  
for  
a  
scholarship  <ARG1
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG1
am*  
being*  
melodramatic  <ARG2
.  

Lol  
.  

@  
Hatmanone  
,  

*  
gasps*  
*  
So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
make*  
a  
good  
prostitute  <ARG2
?  

Are*  
you  >ARG0
saying*  
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
bad*  
in  
bed  <ARG2
?  

How  >ARGM-MNR
would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
know*  
?  

Joking*  
.  

Your  >ARG0
answer*  >>ARG1
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
sweet*  
,  
but  
I  >ARG1
'm*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
compassionate  <ARG2
towards  
teenage  
high  
school  
students  
.  

A  
little  
mellow  
dramatic  
?  

In  
my  
opinion  >ARGM-ADV
,  
far  
too  
many  
people  >>ARG0
are*  
at  
university  <ARG2
studying*  
worthless  
degrees  <ARG1
.  

Yes  >>ARGM-DIS
things  >>ARG1
like  
philosophy  
and  
fashion  >ARG1
design*  
are*  
interesting*  
,  
but  
how  
many  
jobs  >ARG1
are*  
out  
there  <ARG2
for  
someone  <ARGM-ADV
with  
these  
qualifications*  
?  

I  >>ARG1
'm*  
studying*  
to  
be*  
a  
teacher  <ARG2
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
know*  
that  
there  
will  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
jobs  <ARG1
out  
there  <ARGM-LOC
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
done*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
may  
have*  
to  
live*  
somewhere  <ARGM-LOC
rural  
or  
in  
Auckland  
,  
but  
at  >>ARGM-ADV
least  
I  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
pretty  >ARGM-ADV
sure*  
I  >ARG1
'll  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
employable  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
got*  
a  
bachelor  
s  
degree  <ARG1
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
go*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
and  
do*  >ARGM-LVB
further  >ARGM-EXT
study*  
or  
take*  
a  
different  
profession  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
know*  
that  
you  >>ARG2
do*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
get*  
paid*  
that  
much  
more  <ARG1
in  
Australia  <ARGM-LOC
than  
you  
do*  
here  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
it  >ARG1
's*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
all  
about  
how  
much  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
earn*  
,  
cost  >>ARG1
of  
living*  
is*  
much  >ARGM-EXT
higher*  
in  
many  
cities  <ARGM-LOC
in  
Australia  
.  

Try*  
living*  
in  
Sydney  <ARGM-LOC
on  
a  
teacher  
's  
salary  <ARGM-MNR
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
compare*  
it  <ARG1
to  
somewhere  <ARG2
like  
Central  
Otago  
.  

You  >>ARG0
also  
have*  
to  
put*  
up  
with  
all  
the  
annoying  
accents  <ARG1
in  
Australia  
.  

It  
's*  
probably  <ARGM-ADV
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
wise  
idea  <ARG2
to  
keep*  
studying*  
and  
having*  
a  
massive  >ARGM-ADJ
student  >ARG2
loan*  
.  

At  
the  
moment  >ARGM-TMP
there  
's*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
interest*  
,  
but  
that  >ARG1
'll  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
change*  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
add*  
interest  <ARG1
to  
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
've*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
racked*  
up  
.  

And  
they  >>ARG0
're*  
working*  
towards  
being*  
able*  
to  
extradite*  
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
have*  
left*  
the  
country  <ARG1
to  
avoid*  
paying*  
it  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
.  

At  
the  
moment  >>ARGM-TMP
if  
you  >ARG1
move*  >ARGM-ADV
overseas  <ARG2
you  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
come*  
back  <ARG4
to  
New  
Zealand  
for  
a  
short  
amount  <ARGM-TMP
of  
time  
before  
they  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
force*  
you  >ARG0
cough*  
up  
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
all  
that  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
're*  
overseas  <ARG2
you  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
racking*  
up  
interest  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
having*  
the  
option  <ARG1
to  
return*  
to  
NZ  <ARG4
.  

I  >ARG0
guess*  
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
fortunate*  
that  
I  >ARG0
received*  
a  
scholarship  >ARG0
which  >R-ARG0
paid*  
about  
800  <ARG1
f  
my  
course  
fees  
through  
my  
degree  <ARGM-TMP
.  

But  
I  >ARG0
worked*  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
and  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
working*  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
.  

There  
are*  
far  
too  
many  
lazy  
people  >ARG0
out  
there  
who  >R-ARG0
think*  
that  
they  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
sit*  
around  <ARGM-ADV
a  
job  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
fall*  
in  
their  
lap  <ARG4
.  

My  
2  
c.  
....  

Get*  
an  
education*  
!  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
doing*  
fine  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Whilst  
youth  
jobs  >>ARG1
are*  
thin*  >>ARGM-ADV
on  
the

,  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
assume*  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
better*  
in  
Oz  <ARGM-LOC

People  >>ARG0

a

load  <ARGM-ADV
per  
week  
for  
the  
past  
20  
+  
years  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
's*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
anything  <ARG2
new  
.  

It  >ARG0
depends*  
on  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
hunger*  
for  <C-ARG1
.  

700  
f  
jobs  >>ARG1

That  >ARG1

that  >ARG1

why  >>ARGM-CAU
does*  
my

with

it  >ARG1

he  >>ARG1

(

he  >>ARG0

it  <ARG1
out

also

me  <ARG2
a  
problem  <ARG1

that

i  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
stick*  
his

near  
the

he  >ARG0

it  <ARG1
down  <ARGM-DIR
.  
)  

i  >ARG0
handle*  
him  <ARG1
every  
few  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

he  >ARG1
is*  
feisty  <ARG2
,  
as  
most  
king  
snakes  >ARG1
are*  
,  
but  
he  >ARG1
is*  
a  
very  
nice  <ARG2
little  
guy  
-  
he  >>ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
tries*  
to  
bite*  
or  
anything  
.  

i  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
love*  
him  <ARG1
to  
death*  
.  

i  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
why  >ARGM-CAU
he  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
eat*  
though  <ARGM-DIS
!  

i  >>ARG0
have*  
tried*  
feeding*  
him  <ARG2
5  
or  
6  
live  
pinkies  <ARG1
and  
4  
or  
5  
frozen  
(  
thawed*  
)  
pinkies  <ARG1
.  

i  >>ARG0
have*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
tried*  
feeding*  
him  <ARG2
a  
pinky  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
was*  
bigger  
around  <ARG2
than  
he  >ARG1
is*  
.  

i  >>ARG0
have*  
tried*  
putting*  
him  <ARG1
in  
a  
small  
container  <ARG2
and  
putting*  
him  <ARG1
in  
a  
dark  
place  <ARG2
for  
an  
hour  <ARGM-TMP
or  
so  
and  
he  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
touch*  
the  
pinky  <ARG1
.  

he  >>ARG0
crawls*  
on  
top  <ARG1
of  
them  
but  
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
try*  
to  
eat*  
them  <ARG1
.  

he  >>ARG0
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem*  
to  
know*  
that  
they  >ARG1
are*  
food  <ARG2
.  

i  >>ARG0
have*  
tried*  
"  
braining*  
"  
both  
live  
and  
dead  
pinkies  <ARG1
,  
and  
bloodying*  
them  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-PRD
to  
get*  
his  >ARG0
attention*  
,  
but  
he  >>ARG0
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
care*  
.  

i  >>ARG0
have*  
tried*  
dipping*  
both  
live  
and  
thawed*  
pinkies  <ARG1
in  
tuna  
juice  
,  
and  
in  
used  >ARGM-ADJ
gerbil  >ARG1
bedding*  
.  

i  >>ARG0
have*  
bought*  
some  
long  
reptile  
feeding  
tweezers  <ARG1
and  
have*  
tried*  
holding*  
the  
pinky  <ARG1
in  
front  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
snake  
's  
face  
.  

he  >>ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
try*  
to  
bite*  
.  

i  >>ARG1
am*  
very  
discouraged  <ARG2
and  
sad*  
and  
i  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
what  >ARG1
to  
do*  
.  

he  >>ARG0
has*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
eaten*  
in  
an  
entire  
month  <ARGM-TMP
.  

i  >>ARG0
've*  
only  >ARGM-ADV
tried*  
to  
feed*  
him  <ARG2
one  <ARGM-MNR
at  
a  
time  
.  

he  >ARG1
's*  
just  
a  
tiny  
baby  <ARG2
,  
about  
the  
width  
of  
a  
pencil  
.  

do*  
babies  >ARG0
this  
small  
hibernate*  
?  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
feed*  
him  <ARG2
how  
many  
pinkies  >>ARG1
do*  
you  >ARG0
feed*  
him  <ARG2
?  

If  
you  >ARG0
feed*  >>ARGM-ADV
him  <ARG2
too  
many  <ARG1
he  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
just  >>ARGM-ADV
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
hungry*  
.  

If  
he  >>ARG1
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem*  >>ARGM-ADV
interested*  
in  
them  <ARG2
at  
all  <ARGM-EXT
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
he  >>ARG0
's*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG
hungry*  
.  

My  
boyfriend  >ARG0
has*  
one  <ARG1
and  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
she  >>ARG0
's*  
hungry*  >ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG0
attacks*  
the  
pinkie  <ARG1
right  
away  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
smell*  
it  <ARG1
so  >>ARGM-ADV
i  >>ARG0
'm*  
sure*  
he  >>ARG0
knows*  
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
is*  
and  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
it  <ARG1
.  

Remember*  
snakes  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
without  
eating*  
.  

In  
the  
winter  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
usually  >>ARGM-ADV
go*  
deep  
underground  <ARG4
and  
enter*  
a  
hibernation  
-  
like  
state  >ARG1
called*  
brumation*  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
characterized*  
by  
a  
slowed  >ARGM-ADJ
metabolism*  
and  
reduced  
activity  
.  

King  
snakes  >>ARG0
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
stop*  
eating*  
,  
particularly  
during  
the  
cooler  
part  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
year  
.  

They  >ARG0
have*  
a  
natural  
instinct  <ARG1
to  
hibernate*  
.  

If  
the  
snake  >>ARG0
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
pregnant  >>ARGM-ADV
or  
shedding*  
,  
and  
its  
enclosure  >>ARG1
is*  
properly  >ARGM-ADV
equipped*  
,  
a  
loss*  >ARG0
of  
appetite  <ARG1
probably  >ARGM-ADV
signals*  
a  
beginning*  
of  
hibernation*  
.  

Hibernation*  >ARG1
is*  
natural  <ARG2
,  
and  
a  
necessity  
for  
snakes  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are*  
going*  
to  
be*  
bred*  
.  

Another  
thing  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
cause*  
a  
king  
snake  >>ARG0
to  
stop*  
eating*  
is*  
shedding*  
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
tell*  
when  
your  
king  
snake  >>ARG0
is*  
about  <ARG2
to  
shed*  
,  
because  
its  
eyes  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
milky  
looking  <ARG2
.  

Its  
body  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
dull*  
looking  <ARGM-PRD
,  
too  <ARGM-DIS
.  

In  
a  
few  
days  >ARGM-TMP
the  
snake  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
begin*  
to  
shed*  
its  
skin  <ARG1
.  

For  
example  >ARGM-DIS
,  
some  
snakes  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
routinely  >ARGM-TMP
go*  
off  
their  
food  <ARG2
in  
both  
the  
summer  <ARGM-TMP
and  
winter  
,  
feeding*  
mainly  <ARGM-ADV
in  
spring  <ARGM-TMP
and  
fall  
.  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
natural*  
and  
so  
long  >>ARGM-TMP
as  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see*  
any  
serious  >ARGM-EXT
deterioration*  
in  
their  
health  <ARG1
is*  
nothing  >ARG1
to  
worry*  
about  <C-ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
see*  
,  
some  
snakes  >ARG0
for  
no  
obvious  
reason  >ARGM-PRP
will  >ARGM-MOD
simply  >ARGM-ADV
go*  
off  
their  
food  <ARG2
.  

They  >>ARG2
're*  
fit*  
and  
healthy*  
and  
their  >ARG0
care*  >>ARG1
is*  
suitable*  
.  

hope*  
this  >ARG0
helped*  
.  

That  >ARG1
's*  
why  >>ARGM-CAU
it  >>ARG0
's*  
good*  
to  
have*  
a  
python  <ARG1
!  

It  >>ARG0
's*  
twice  
my  
size  <ARG2
and  
eats*  
a  
rabbit  <ARG1
once  
a  
month  
.  

are*  
my  
two  
cats  >>ARG0
fighting*  
or  
playing*  
?  

how  
rough  >>ARG1
is*  
too  >ARGM-EXT
rough*  
?  

help*  
!?  

i  >ARG0
have*  
a  
1  
and  
a  
half  
year  
old  
male  
neutered  
cat  <ARG1
and  
a  
new  
2  
month  
old  
spayed  
female  
kitten  
.  

the  
first  
night  >>ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
brought*  
her  <ARG1
home  <ARG2
i  >>ARG0
did*  
the  
sniffing*  
under  
the  
door  <ARGM-LOC
thing  <<ARG1
and  
left*  
it  <ARG1
at  
that  <ARG1
.  

the  
next  
day  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
let*  
her  <ARG1
out  
of  
the  
bedroom  <ARG1
so  
they  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
check*  
each  
other  <ARG1
out  <C-V
,  
and  
the  
kitten  >ARG0
hissed*  
twice  <ARGM-TMP
within  
the  
first  
20  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
of  
meeting*  
each  
other  <ARG1
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG0
no  
longer  >ARGM-NEG
hisses*  
and  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
playing*  
(  
chasing*  
each  
other  <ARG1
up  
and  
down  
the  
hall  <ARGM-DIR
,  
rolling*  
around  <ARGM-DIR
on  
the  
ground  <ARG2
and  
pawing*  
at  
each  
other  <ARG1
)  
.  

only  
once  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG0
looked*  
like  
my  
male  
cat  >>ARG0
was*  
biting*  
at  
her  
neck  <ARG1
and  
then  
her  
stomach  
and  
she  >>ARG0
was*  
meowing*  
fairly  
loud  <ARGM-MNR
and  
hissed*  
once  <ARGM-TMP
then  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
backed*  
off  
and  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG1
are*  
fine*  
.  

were  
they  >ARG0
roughhouse  >ARGM-MNR
playing*  
?  

or  >ARGM-DIS
were  
they  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
fighting*  
?  

he  >>ARG0
has*  
been*  
"  
biting*  
"  
at  
her  
neck  <ARG1
and  
stomach  
previously  <ARGM-TMP
while  
they  >ARG0
play*  
without  
her  >ARG0
meowing*  
or  
anything  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
i  >>ARG0
m*  
wondering*  
if  
he  >ARG0

a  
little  
to  
far  <ARGM-EXT
that  
one  
time  <ARGM-TMP

any

you  >>ARG0

help*  
her  >>ARG1
to  
feel*  
safe*  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
give*  
her  >ARG0
a  
place  >ARG4
to  
go*  
to  <C-ARG4
when  >ARGM-TMP
scared*  
.  

right  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
your  
male  >>ARG0
is*  
fighting*  
off  
an  
intruder  <ARG1
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
feels*  
that  
all  >ARG1
of  
the  
house  
is*  
his  <ARG2
.  

put*  
her  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
in  
the  
room  <ARG2
,  
and  
keep*  
the  
door  >ARG1
closed*  
for  
a  
week  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

then  >ARGM-ADV
let*  
her  <ARG1
out  <ARG1
for  
ten  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
.  

make*  
it  <ARG1
fifteen  <ARG1
the  
next  
day  <ARGM-TMP
,  
then  
twenty  <C-ARG1
,  
and  
so  
on  <C-ARG1
.  

this  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
two  
things  <ARG1
;  
the  
new  
kitten  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
rub*  
her  
cheek  <ARG1
on  
the  
furniture  <ARG2
in  
her  
room  
,  
making*  
it  <ARG1
her  
territory  <ARG1
.  

she  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
start*  
to  
calm*  
down  
and  
feel*  
safe*  
-  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
bet*  
she  
does*  
n't  
now  <<ARG2
.  

she  >>ARG0
knows*  
she  >>ARG0
is*  
invading*  
someone  
else  
's  
territory  <ARG1
,  
but  
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
help*  
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
has*  
no  
where  >ARG4
to  
go*  
.  

she  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
sleep*  
without  
being*  
afraid*  
.  

as  >>ARGM-DIS
well  
,  
your  
male  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
see*  
that  
his  
territory  >>ARG2
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
threatened*  
.  

when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
door  >ARG1
opens*  >ARGM-TMP
,  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
that  
the  
one  
room  >ARG1
is*  
hers  <ARG2
,  
and  
he  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
OK  <ARG2
with  
that  
.  

the  
territory  
thing  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
solved*  
.  

your  
male  >>ARG0
is*  
hurting*  
her  <ARG1
to  
put*  
her  <ARG1
in  
her  
place  <ARG2
-  
biting*  >ARG1
her  
scruff  <ARG1
is*  
dominance*  
and  
biting*  >ARG1
the  
belly  <ARG1
is*  
a  
move*  >ARG1
cats  >ARG0
use*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
hunting*  
-  
to  
pull*  
the  
guts  <ARG1
out  
of  
their  
prey  <ARG2
.  

this  >>ARG1
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
good*  
.  

give*  
them  <ARG2
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
set*  
up  
their  
territories  <ARG1
,  
and  
once  
you  >ARG0
bring*  >ARGM-TMP
the  
new  
kitten  <ARG1
out  <ARG3
,  
pay*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
attention*  
to  
the  
male  <<ARG2
.  

you  >>ARG0
have*  
brought*  
someone  <ARG1
else  
into  
his  
territory  <ARG2
,  
and  
he  >>ARG2
needs*  
to  
be*  
reminded*  
that  
you  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
love*  
him  <ARG1
,  
and  
support*  
his  >ARG0
claim*  
to  
his  
space  <ARG1
.  

that  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
help*  
to  
reassure*  
him  <ARG1
,  
and  
he  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
less  >ARGM-CXN
aggressive*  
with  
her  <ARG1
.  

when  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
play  
fight*  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hiss*  
.  

if  
they  >ARG0
hiss*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
playing*  
.  

if  
they  >ARG0
bite*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
and  
one  >ARG0
cries*  
,  
you  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
separate*  
them  <ARG1
,  
and  
you  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
keep*  
an  
eye  <ARG2
on  
them  
.  

hissing*  >ARG1
is*  
OK  <ARG2
,  
unless  
they  >>ARG0
start*  
to  
fight*  
.  

if  
that  >ARG1
happens*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
separate*  
them  <ARG1
,  
and  
give*  
them  <ARG2
time  <ARG1
apart  
.  

putting*  >ARG0
the  
girl  <ARG1
in  
her  
territory  <ARG2
will  >ARGM-MOD
make*  
her  >>ARG0
feel*  
less  >ARGM-EXT
afraid*  
,  
and  
she  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
relax*  
.  

good  
luck  
!  

A  
hiss  >ARG1
is*  
basically  <ARGM-ADV
a  
"  
get*  >ARG3
the  
f*ck  
away  <ARG2
"  
sound*  
.  

It  >ARG1
means*  
they  >>ARG0
've*  
gone*  
too  
far  <ARGM-EXT
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG1
start*  >>ARGM-TMP
bleeding*  
that  >ARG1
means*  
they  >>ARG0
're*  
really  >ARGM-ADV
fighting*  
.  

If  
they  >>ARG0
're*  
going*  >>ARGM-ADV
kinda  
slow  <ARGM-MNR
and  
like  >>ARGM-DIS
fake  >ARGM-MNR
biting*  
(  
not  >ARGM-NEG
biting*  
as  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
as  
they  
can  
)  
,  
and  
fake  >ARGM-ADJ
scratching*  
(  
not  >ARGM-NEG
hitting*  
as  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
as  
they  
can  
with  
their  
paws  <ARGM-MNR
)  
then  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
're*  
playing*  
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
two  
cats  <ARG1
,  
and  
at  
first  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
hissed*  
at  
each  
other  <ARGM-GOL
because  
cats  >ARG1
are*  
very  
territorial  <ARG2
,  
but  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
do*  
fight*  
and  
play*  
.  

The  
difference*  >ARG1
is*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
cat  >ARG0
hisses*  >ARGM-TMP
,  
that  >ARG1
means*  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
annoyed*  
and  
they  >ARG0
want*  
the  
other  
cat  >ARG0
to  
go*  
away  <ARGM-DIR
.  

That  >ARG1
means*  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
fighting*  
.  

When  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
jumping*  >>ARGM-TMP
at  
each  
other  <ARGM-DIR
and  
their  
tails  >>ARG1
are*  
wagging*  
that  >ARG1
means*  
that  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
playing*  
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see*  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
you  >>ARG1
get*  
confused*  
though  <ARGM-DIS
.  
:)  

What  
was  
the  
goal  
for  
North  
Vietnam  
in  
the  
Tet  
offensive  
?  

When  >ARGM-TMP
Johnson  >ARG0
deployed*  >>ARGM-TMP
troops  <ARG1
in  
1964  <ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG1
was*  
advised*  
by  
the  
military  <ARG0
it  
would  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
a  
half  
-  
million  
troops  <ARG2
about  
ten  
years  <ARG1
to  
pacify*  
South  
Vietnam  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
refused*  
to  
believe*  
them  <ARG1
and  
ordered*  
the  
military  >ARG0
to  
win*  
the  
war*  
within  
two  
to  
three  
years  <<ARGM-TMP
(  
before  
the  
next  >ARGM-TMP
election*  
in  
1968  <ARGM-TMP
)  
.  

He  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
give*  
them  <ARG2
the  
number  >ARG1
of  
troops  
they  >ARG0
requested*  
.  

This  >ARG0
left*  
Westmoreland  <ARG1
with  
few  
options  <ARG1
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
he  >ARG0
adapted*  
a  
Search*  
and  
Destroy*  
strategy  <<ARG1
instead  
of  
a  
Clear*  
and  
Defend*  
strategy  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
is*  
,  
in  
the  
long  >ARGM-ADJ
run*  
,  
the  
preferred  
method  <<ARG2
of  
pacifying*  
an  
insurgency  <ARG1
.  

Thing  >ARG1
is*  
,  
it  >ARG1
worked*  
.  

The  
ARVN  >>ARG0
was*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
having*  
a  
big  
problem  <ARG1
with  
the  
Local  
VC  
(  
the  
guerilla  >ARG0
movement*  
)  
,  
they  >>ARG1
were*  
being*  
challenged*  
by  
the  
Main  
Force  
VC  >ARG1
(  
which  >R-ARG1
was*  
light  
infantry  <ARG2
)  
and  
the  
North  
Vietnamese  
Army  
(  
NVA  
)  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
the  
Americans  >ARG1
swept*  >>ARGM-TMP
in  <ARG3
with  
their  >>ARG0
Search*  >>ARG3
and  
Destroy*  
operations*  
the  
Communists  >ARG0
quickly  >ARGM-TMP
leaned*  
they  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
stand*  
up  
to  
the  
US  
firepower  <ARG2
,  
and  
these  
regular  
troops  >>ARG0
were*  
forced*  
to  
flee*  
the  
country  <ARG1
and  
take*  
sanctuary  <ARG1
across  
the  
borders  <ARG3
in  
Laos  <ARGM-LOC
and  
Cambodia  
.  

All  
those  
sunny  >ARGM-ADJ
reports*  >>ARG1
about  
the  
progress*  
in  
Vietnam  <ARGM-LOC
were*  
correct*  
,  
the  
Communists  >>ARG1
WERE*  
being*  
defeated*  
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
Johnson  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
let*  
the  
military  >>ARG0
cross*  
the  
borders  <ARG1
and  
clean*  
out  
the  
Communist  
bases  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG2
was*  
warned*  
that  
they  >>ARG0
were*  
building*  
up  
a  
huge  
Army  <ARG1
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
eventually  >ARGM-TMP
launch*  
an  
attack*  
,  
but  
he  >ARG0
ignored*  
his  
military  
advisers  <ARG1
.  

The  
Communists  >ARG0
agreed*  
.  

They  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
defeat*  
the  
Americans  <ARG1
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
hoped*  
to  
do*  
during  
the  
Tet  
Offensive  <ARGM-TMP
was*  
to  
sneak*  
past  
the  
Americans  <ARGM-DIR
and  
attack*  
the  
ARVN  <ARG1
in  
the  
urban  
areas  >>ARG2
where  >>R-ARG2
they  >>ARG0
were*  
deployed*  
doing*  >>ARGM-LVB
successful  >>ARGM-ADJ
Clear*  >>ARG3
and  
Defend*  
operations*  
.  

The  
Communists  >ARG0
thought*  
they  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
defeat*  
the  
ARVN  <ARG1
,  
cause*  
the  
fall*  
of  
the  
South  
Vietnamese  
government  <ARG1
,  
and  
the  
people  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
than  >>ARGM-TMP
rally*  
to  
the  
Communist  
cause  <ARG2
and  
leave*  
the  
Americans  <ARG1
stranded  <ARG2
in  
a  
sea  
of  
angry  
peasants  
.  

THAT  >ARG1
WAS*  
THE  
PLAN*  
.  

What  >ARG1
happened*  
?  

The  
Americans  >>ARG0
detected*  
the  
attempt*  
to  
infiltrate*  
the  
urban  
areas  <ARG1
and  
were*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
redeploying*  
troops  <ARG1
from  
the  
rural  
areas  
.  

The  
ARVN  >>ARG0
rushed*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
from  
holiday  >ARG1
leave*  
and  
counterattacked*  
.  

Within  
24  
hours  >>ARGM-TMP
every  
Communist  >ARG0
assault*  >>ARG1
had*  
been*  
defeated*  
except  
in  
the  
ancient  
capital  <ARGM-ADV
of  
Hue  
.  

The  
government  >>ARG1
did*  
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
fall*  
.  

And  
the  
South  
Vietnamese  
people  
?  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
give*  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
ultimate  >ARGM-ADJ
choice*  
,  
they  >ARG1
rallied*  
…  

TO  
THE  
SOUTH  
VIETNAMESE  
GOVERNMENT  
….  

Tet  >ARG1
was*  
a  
huge  
military  
and  
political  
disaster  <ARG2
for  
the  
Communists  
.  

They  >>ARG1
were*  
chased*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
into  
Laos  
and  
Cambodia  
with  
the  
ARVN  <ARGM-ADV
in  
hot  >ARGM-ADJ
pursuit*  
.  

The  
people  >ARG0
rejected*  
their  >ARG0
attempt*  
to  
topple*  
the  
government  <ARG1
,  
and  
for  
all  
intents  >ARGM-ADV
and  
purposes  
the  
US  
military  >ARG0
(  
and  
the  
ARVN  
)  
handed*  
Johnson  <ARG2
the  
victory*  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
had*  
ordered*  
them  >ARG0
to  
achieve*  
within  
the  
time  
-  
frame  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
ordered*  
it  <ARG2
.  

All  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
do*  
for  
a  
complete  >ARGM-EXT
victory*  
was*  
allow*  
the  
military  >>ARG0
to  
go*  
into  
Laos  <ARG4
and  
Cambodia  
and  
finish*  
off  
the  
shattered  
Communist  
forces  <ARG1
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
Johnson  >ARG1
was*  
so  
obtuse  <ARG2
he  >>ARG0
did*  
n’t  >ARGM-NEG
understand*  
he  >>ARG0
had*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
victory*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
was*  
handed*  
to  
him  <ARG2
on  
a  
silver  
platter  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Instead  >>ARGM-DIS
he  >>ARG0
pulled*  
the  
military  <ARG1
off  <ARG2
,  
stopped*  
the  
bombing*  
of  
North  
Vietnam  <ARG1
,  
withdrew*  
from  
the  
presidential  >ARG2
race*  
,  
and  
spent*  
the  
rest  <ARG1
of  
his  
term  
in  
office  
trying*  
to  
surrender*  
to  
North  
Vietnam  <ARG2
.  

They  >>ARG0
screwed*  
up  
by  
not  >ARGM-NEG
accepting*  
his  >ARG0
surrender*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
offered*  
it  <ARG1
.  

The  
American  
people  >>ARG0
were*  
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
having*  
any  <ARG1
of  
it  
,  
and  
elected*  
Richard  >>ARG0
Nixon  
to  
fix*  
the  
mess  >>ARG1
LBJ  >>ARG0
had*  
made*  
(  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
surrender*  
like  
the  
antiwar  >ARG1
movement*  >>ARG0
was*  
demanding*  
)  
.  

In  
the  
end*  >ARGM-TMP
Nixon  >ARG0
kept*  
his  >ARG0
promise*  
for  
“  
…  
peace*  
with  
honor*  
….  
”  

But  >ARGM-DIS
that  >ARG1
’s*  
another  
question  <ARG2
.  

To  
emancipate*  
the  
south  <ARG1
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
was*  
a  
serious  
failure  <ARG2
.  

To  
make*  
the  
war*  
unpalatable  <<ARG1
to  
the  
American  
public  
.  

In  
that  >ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >ARG0
pretty  
much  >ARGM-EXT
succeeded*  
.  

Before  
Tet  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
war*  >>ARG1
was*  
unpopular  <ARG2
but  
tolerable*  
to  
the  
majority  <ARG0
of  
Americans  
in  
that  
the  
loss*  >>ARG1
of  
American  
lives  <ARG1
was*  
seen*  
as  
the  
cost  <ARG2
of  
subduing*  
the  
VC  <ARG1
and  
NVA  
.  

Tet  >ARG0
made*  
it  <ARG1
clear*  
that  
the  
war*  >ARG1
was*  
a  
long  >ARGM-DIR
way*  
from  
being*  
over  <ARG2
if  
the  
Americans  >ARG0
thought*  
they  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
preserve*  
the  
South  <ARG1
and  
that  
the  
North  >>ARG0
was*  
perfectly  >ARGM-ADV
willing*  
to  
suffer*  
great  >ARGM-EXT
losses*  
to  
continue*  
their  >ARG0
fight*  
.  

There  
is*  
a  
very  
good

Bearded  
dragon  
question  
...  
?  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
bought*  
a  
baby  <ARG1
one  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
basking  
spot  
lamp  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
says*  
it  >>ARG0
is*  
a  
double  
reflector  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
focuses*  
35  
%  
more  
light  <ARG1
/  
heat  
and  
provides*  
beneficial  
UVA  
rays  <ARG1
important  
to  
the  
psycholical  >ARGM-MNR
well  >ARGM-MNR
-  
being*  
of  
him  <ARG1
.  

My  
question  >ARG1
is*  
does*  
that  >ARG1
mean*  
it  >ARG0
gives*  
him  <ARG2
not  
only  
the  
heat  <ARG1
,  
but  
the  
"  
sun  
rays  >ARG1
"  
he  >ARG0
needs*  
?  

I  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-DIS
was*  
wondering*  
how  
long  >ARGM-EXT
should  >ARGM-MOD
this  
light  >ARG1
be*  
on  <ARG2
.  

The  
lady  >ARG0
at  
pet  
smart  
said*  
4  
hours  <ARG1
,  
but  
on  
places  >ARGM-LOC
on  
the  
net  
it  >ARG0
says*  
10  
to  
12  
hours  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
's*  
getting*  
used*  
to  
his  
new  
home  <ARG1
,  
but  
has*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
eatin*  
yet  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
bearded  
dragon  
juvenile  
food  <ARG1
and  
freeze  
-  
dried  
crickets  
.  

Any  
advice  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
greatly  >ARGM-ADV
appreciated*  
.  

Thank*  
you  <ARG1
for  
your  
time  <ARG2
.  

Let*  
me  >>ARG0
try*  
to  
break*  
this  <ARG1
down  <C-V
as  
simply  <ARGM-MNR
as  
I  
can  
:  
diurnal  
(  
active  
during  
the  
day  
time  
)  
reptiles  >ARG0
like  
the  
bearded  
dragon  
require*  
3  
types  <ARG1
of  
"  
light  
,  
"  
UVA  
,  
UVB  
,  
and  
heat  
.  

Any  
white  
light  
emitting  
light  
source  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
emit*  
UVA  <ARG1
,  
including  
heat  
bulbs  <C-ARG0
,  
that  >ARG1
's*  
the  
easy  
one  >ARG2
to  
provide*  
for  <C-ARG2
.  

UVB  >>ARG1
on  
the  
other  
hand  >>ARGM-ADV
can  >>ARGM-MOD
only  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
reproduced*  
by  
a  
fluorescent  
source  <ARG0
.  

UVB  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
always  >ARGM-TMP
be*  
a  
separate  
bulb  <ARG2
from  
the  
heat  
lamp  
,  
unless  
you  >ARG0
use*  
a  
MVB  >ARG1
(  
mercury  
vapor  
bulb  
)  
which  >R-ARG1
is*  
the  
only  
reptile  >ARG0
use*  
bulb  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
emit*  
both  
UVB  <ARG1
and  
heat  
from  
one  
bulb  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
that  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
use*  
coiled  
/  
compact  
UVB  
bulbs  <ARG1
as  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
known*  
to  
cause*  
severe  >ARGM-EXT
eye  >ARG1
damage*  
and  
/  
or  
blindness  
in  
reptiles  <<ARGM-LOC
not  
to  
mention  
they  >ARG0
have*  
trouble  <ARG1
maintaining*  
UVB  >ARG1
output*  
over  
time  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
long  
tube  
UVB  
bulbs  >>ARG1
are*  
best*  
,  
like  
Zoomed  
's  
Repsitun  
model  <ARGM-PRD
:  
http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/  
Remember*  
to  
replace*  
UVB  
bulbs  <ARG1
according  
to  
the  
manufacturer  >ARG0
s  >ARG0
recommendation*  >ARGM-TMP
after  
which  
time  >R-ARGM-TMP
the  
bulb  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
no  
longer  >ARGM-TMP
produce*  
UVB  <ARG1
even  
if  
visible  
light  
still  
is*  
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
to  
answer*  >>ARGM-PRP
your  
question  <ARG1
,  
no  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
have*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
bulb  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
says*  
it  >ARG0
produces*  
UVA  <ARG1
then  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
"  
the  
sun  
's  
rays  >ARG1
"  
that  >R-ARG1
your  
bearded  >ARG0
needs*  
.  

You  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
also  >ARGM-ADV
provide*  
a  
source  <ARG1
a  
UVB  
lighting  
.  

The  
person  >>ARG1
at  
Petsmart  
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
wrong*  
;  
in  
fact  >ARGM-ADV
it  
is*  
always  <ARGM-TMP
a  
good  
idea  <ARG2
to  
second  >ARGM-ADV
guess*  
what  >ARG1
most  
pet  
store  
employees  >ARG0
tell*  
you  <ARG2
;  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
the  
best  
track  
record  <ARG1
regarding  
giving*  
reliable  
pet  >ARG1
care*  
info  <<ARG1
.  

UVB  >>ARG2
and  
basking  
temp  
(  
should  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
about  
110  
F  <ARG2
for  
a  
baby  
,  
95  
F  
for  
an  
adult  
)  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
available*  
for  
10  
-  
12  
hours  
a  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Freeze  
dried  
food  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
good  
staple  
food  
source  <ARG2
;  
you  >ARG0
need*  
to  
offer*  
live  
feeder  
insects  <ARG1
.  

Bearded  
dragons  >ARG1
are*  
sight  
hunters  <ARG2
,  
they  >ARG0
need*  
to  
see*  
the  
food  >ARG1
move*  
to  
trigger*  
a  
feeding  >ARGM-PRD
response*  
,  
especially  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG1
are*  
babies  <ARG2
.  

Live  
food  >>ARG1
is*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
higher*  
in  
nutritional  
value  <ARG2
than  
freeze  
dried  <ARGM-CXN
.  

Crickets  >ARG1
,  
silk  
worms  
,  
phoenix  
worms  
,  
and  
various  
feeder  
roaches  
,  
like  
red  
-  
lobster  
,  
turkistan  
,  
and  
dubia  
,  
are*  
good  
example  <ARG2
of  
staple  
insects  >ARG1
to  
offer*  
your  
bearded  <ARG3
.  

Wax  
worms  >>ARG1
and  
meal  
worms  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
only  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
offered*  
as  
treat  
items  <ARGM-PRD
,  
for  
variety  
's  
sake  <ARGM-PRP
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
that  
you  >>ARG0
read*  
through  
some  
reliable  
bearded*  
guides  <ARG1
to  
make*  
sure*  
you  >ARG0
have*  
everything  >ARG1
set*  
up  
correctly  <ARGM-MNR
:

http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/caresheet/?page=1  

mm  >ARGM-DIS
it  >ARG0
depends*  
on  
the  
size  <ARG1
of  
his  
tank  
or  
cage  
or  
whatever  
you  >ARG0
have*  
him  <ARG1
in  
..  
atleast  
as  
far  <<ARGM-ADV
as  
i  >>ARG1
'm*  
concerned*  
.  

if  
there  
are*  >ARGM-ADV
shady  
areas  <ARG1
he  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
move*  
to  <ARG2
(  
for  
example  
a  
3  
x  
5  
x  
4  
tank  
with  
light  
on  
one  
side  
)  
then  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
leave*  
it  <ARG1
on  <ARG1
a  
full  
12  
-  
14  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
,  
if  
it  >ARG1
s*  
a  
small  
tank  <ARG2
and  
he  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
escape*  
the  
light  <ARG1
then  
4  
-  
6  
at  
most  
at  
a  
time  
though  
quite  
possibly  
4  
-  
6  
hours  
at  
a  
time  
twice  
a  
day  
.  

either  
way*  >ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
need*  
to  
keep*  
an  
eye  <ARG1
on  
the  
temperature  <ARG2
if  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
using*  
a  
dry  
fish  
tank  <ARG1
as  <ARG2
UV  
lights  <ARG2
in  
my  >ARG0
experience*  >>ARGM-ADV
up  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
temperature  
significantly  
and  
without  
proper  >ARGM-MNR
ventilation*  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
become*  
an  
oven  <ARG2
.  

as  
to  
what  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
light  >ARG0
provides*  
it  >ARG0
gives*  
UV  
rays  >>ARG1
..  <ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
important*  
for  
health  <ARG2
in  
lizards  <ARGM-LOC
as  
it  >ARG1
is*  
in  
humans  <ARGM-LOC
.  

That  
lady  >ARG1
at  
PetSmart  
is*  
a  
disgrace  <ARG2
to  
the  
rest  
of  
us  
PetSmart  
associates  
...  
sheesh  <ARGM-DIS
.  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
it  >ARG0
gives*  
him  <ARG2
the  
"  
sun  
rays  <ARG1
"  
necessary  
,  
that  >ARG1
's*  
what  >ARG2
UVA  >ARG1
is*  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
it  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
on  <ARG2
10  
-  
12  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
,  
just  
like  
the  
sun  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
up  <ARG2
for  
10  
-  
12  
hours  <ARGM-EXT
in  
his  
natural  
environment  <ARGM-LOC
.  

As  
for  
the  
heat  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
sure*  
to  
use*  
a  
thermometer  <ARG1
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
Beardies  >>ARG0
often  >>ARGM-TMP
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
eat*  
food  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
moving*  
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
it  
s*  
anyone  >ARG0
's  
guess*  
whether  
or  
not  
he  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
touch*  
the  
freeze  
-  
dried  
crickets  <ARG1
or  
the  
processed  
food  
.  

I  >ARG0
tell*  
all  
my  
customers  <ARG2
they  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
try*  
it  <ARG1
,  
but  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
count*  
on  
it  <ARG1
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
try*  
green  
leafy  
veggies  <ARG1
,  
like  
kale  
and  
spinach  
.  

Best  
of  
luck  
!  

Is*  
a  
finch  >ARG1
or  
a  
parakeet  
better*  
?

a  
christmas  
list  <ARG1
for  
my  
parents  <ARG3
and

going*  
to

the  
affordable  
ones  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
i  >ARG0
like*  
,  
and  
i  >>ARG0
was*  
wondering*

and  
which  >ARG1

more  >ARGM-EXT
fun*  >ARG1
to  
have*  
as  
pets  <ARGM-PRD
AND  
I  >>ARG0
NEED*  
TO  
KNOW*  
WHICH  >>ARG1
WOULD  >>ARGM-MOD
BE*  
QUIETEST*  
i  >>ARG0
honestly  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
care*  
but  
my  
family  
does*  
!  

Please  >ARGM-DIS

me  <ARG1
!  

oh  
and  
please  >ARGM-DIS
say*  
y  >>ARGM-CAU
one  >>ARG1
is*  
better*  
thx  
!!!!!!  

Hi  
there  
,  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
choose*  
the  
parakeet  <ARG1
...  

Here  >ARG2
s*  
my  
reason  <ARG1
.....  

I  >ARG0
did*  
the  
same  
thing  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
you  >ARG0
did*  
for  
christmas  <<ARGM-PRP
.  

I  >>ARG0
ended*  
up  
getting*  
a  
pair  <ARG1
of  
zebra  
finches  
for  
christmas  <ARGM-TMP
.  

At  
first  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
was*  
all  >ARGM-ADV
cool*  
and  
all  
.  

They  >>ARG0
were*  
chirping*  
and  
doing*  
their  
every  
day  
business  <ARG1
.  

After  
a  
couple  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
weeks  
I  >>ARG0
got*  
tired*  
of  
them  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG1
are*  
quite  
messy  <ARG2
and  
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
hold*  
or  
pet*  
them  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
ve*  
tried*  
to  
tame*  
them  <ARG1
and  
they  >>ARG1
just  >>ARGM-ADV
would  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
get*  
tamed*  
.  

They  >>ARG1
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
be*  
held*  
or  
touched*  
.  

I  >ARG0
want*  
a  
bird  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
hold*  
and  
do*  
tricks*  
.  

I  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
have*  
them  <ARG1
and  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
doing*  
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

A  
couple  
of  
months  
after  
I  >ARG0
got*  
parakeets  
/  
budgies  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG1
are*  
adorable*  
they  >ARG0
have*  
beautiful  
colors  <ARG1
and  
personality  
.  

I  >ARG0
love*  
them  <ARG1
.  

First  >ARGM-TMP
of  
all  
they  >ARG1
are*  
very  
tame  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
tamed*  
them  <ARG1
in  
4  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
tricks*  
and  
they  >ARG1
are*  
nt  <ARGM-NEG
messy  <ARG2
.  

The  
whole  
family  >ARG0
loves*  
them  <ARG1
.  

My  
parents  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
plays*  
with  
them  <ARG3
.  

They  >ARG1
are*  
a  
big  
part  <ARG2
of  
our  
family  
.  

I  >ARG0
hope*  
this  >ARG0
helps*  
you  <ARG2
with  
your  >ARG0
decision*  
.  

They  >ARG1
are*  
both  <ARGM-ADV
about  
the  
same  
noise  
level  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
choosing*  >ARGM-TMP
a  
parakeet  <ARG1
look*  
for  
a  
young  
one  <ARG1
.  

(  
the  
younger  
the  
eaiser  
to  
tame*  
)  
Look*  
for  
clean  
smooth  
feathers  
,  
beak  <ARG1
,  
and  
clean  
vent  
feathers  
(  
the  
feathers  
around  
the  
butt  
..  
dirty  
vent  
feathers  >ARG1
means*  
the  
bird  >>ARG2
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
healthy*  
)  
Look*  
for  
a  
dark  
eye  <ARG1
with  
no  
circles  
(  
the  
older  
ones  >ARG0
have*  
a  
circle  
ring  <ARG1
in  
their  
eyes  
)  
.  

Look*  
for  
a  
lot  >>ARG0
of  
stripes  
in  
their  
head  
that  >>R-ARG0
starts*  
from  
the  
beak  <ARGM-DIR
and  
goes*  
back  <ARG4
to  
the  
back  
fo  
the  
bird  
.  

the  
stripes  >ARG1
are*  
like  
hair  <ARG2
the  
less  
stipes  
the  
older  
.  

(  
think*  
of  
a  
balding  
man  <ARG1
lol  <ARGM-DIS
)  
Look*  
for  
clean  
feathers  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
want*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
boy  <ARG1
the  
cere  >>ARG1
(  
the  
nostrils  
piece  
above  
the  
beak  
)  
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
blue*  
.  

The  
girl  >ARG0
has*  
either  
pink  <ARG1
or  
brown  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
that  
you  >ARG0
get*  
two  
parakeets  <ARG1
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
get*  
either  
one  
male  <ARG1
and  
one  
female  
,  
or  
two  
males  
.  

Do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
two  
females  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG1
sometimes  >>ARGM-TMP
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
along  
(  
you  >ARG0
know*  
how  >ARG2
some  
girls  >ARG1
are*  
lol  
hahahaahh  
but  
for  
real  >ARGM-ADV
though  >ARGM-ADV
,  
two  
girls  >>ARG0
tend*  
to  
fight*  
a  
lot  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
one  
yellow  
girl  <ARG1
and  
a  
green  
and  
yellow  
boy  
.  

They  >ARG1
are*  
the  
best  <ARG2
!  

If  
you  >>ARG0
choose*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
get*  
a  
parakeet  <ARG1
this  >ARG1
is*  
a  
trick*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
used*  
to  
tame*  
them  <ARG1
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
if  
you  >ARG0
plan*  >>ARGM-ADV
on  
getting*  
one  <ARG1
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
get*  
more  
than  
one  <ARG1
at  
the  
same  
time  <ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
need*  
company  <ARG1
.  

My  
mom  >ARG0
told*  
me  >ARG0
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
tame*  
them  <ARG1
and  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
happy*  
with  
the  
results  <ARG0
.  

It  
took*  
me  <ARG2
4  
days  <ARG1
to  
get*  
the  
new  
one  >>ARG0
to  
be*  
able*  
to  
step*  
on  <ARG2
and  
eat*  
out  
of  
my  
hand  <ARGM-DIR
.  

These  >ARG1
are*  
the  
steps*  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
used*  
.  

Honestly  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
have*  
worked*  
for  
me  <ARG2
twice  <ARGM-TMP
with  
my  
parakeets  <ARG1
.  

Hopefully  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
work*  
for  
you  <ARG2

him  <ARG1

Leave*  
them  <ARG1

such  
for  
about  
2

Then  >ARGM-TMP
place*  
you

I  >>ARG0

it  >>ARG0

them  <ARG1

Do*  
this  <ARG1

about  
one

After  
about

on  
my

They  >>ARG0

awesome*  
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

And  >ARGM-DIS
that  >ARG1
s*  
my  
reason  >ARGM-CAU
why  >R-ARGM-CAU
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
choose*  
a  
parakeet  <ARG1
over  
a  
finch  <ARGM-ADV
.  

a  
parakeet  >>ARG1
is*  
friendlier*  

Parakeet  
.  

They  >>ARG1
are*  
normally  >ARGM-MNR
quiet*  
and  
it  
is*  
easy*  
to  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
them  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG1
are*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
friendly*  
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
parakeet  >ARG1
named*  
Cookie  <ARG2
.  
:P  

When  >ARG2
is*  
the  
best  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
travel*  
to  
Ireland  <ARG1
?  

My  
sister  >>ARG0
and  
I  
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
go*  
to  
Ireland  <ARG4
.  

I  >ARG1
graduate*  
in  
the  
spring  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
go*  
between  
then  <ARGM-TMP
and  
winter  
.  

We  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
too  
many  
tourists  <ARG1
,  
and  
since  
we  >ARG1
'll  >ARGM-MOD
both  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
out  
of  
school  >ARGM-CAU
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
anytime  <ARGM-TMP
between  
the  
middle  
of  
June  
to  
early  
November  
.  

We  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
it  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
too  >ARGM-EXT
cold*  
(  
not  
sure  
when  >ARG2
exactly  
there  
fall  >ARG1
is*  
...  
or  
what  >ARG2
the  
weather  >ARG1
is*  
really  <ARGM-ADV
like  <C-ARG2
there  <ARGM-LOC
during  
our  
autumn  
months  <ARGM-TMP
)  
,  
but  
we  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
feel*  
like  
we  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
go*  
right  
in  
the  
middle  <ARGM-TMP
of  
summer  
either  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

We  >>ARG0
're*  
both  >ARGM-ADV
in  
our  
early  
20s  <ARG2
and  
just  >ARGM-ADV
wanting*  
to  
explore*  
the  
beautiful  
country  <ARG1
while  
we  >>ARG1
're*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
young*  
and  
before  
our  
lives  >>ARG1
start*  
to  
get*  
even  >ARGM-ADV
crazier*  
!  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
anyone  >ARG0
give*  
me  <ARG2
an  
idea  <ARG1
of  
when  >>ARG2
the  
best  
time  >>ARG1
for  
us  >ARG0
to  
go*  
to  
Ireland  <ARG4
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
?  

People  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
to  
Ireland  <ARG4
on  
holiday*  
for  
the  
weather  <<ARGM-PRP
,  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
unpredictable*  
.  

One  
thing  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
sure*  
of  <C-ARG1
about  
Irish  
weather  
is*  
how  
little  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
sure*  
of  <C-ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
shirtsleeves  <ARG2
and  
sunglasses  
in  
February  
,  
but  
winter  
woollies  
in  
March  
and  
even  
during  
the  
summer  
.  

And  
then  >ARGM-ADV
there  
’s*  
the  
rain  <ARG1
.  

Ireland  >ARG0
receives*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
rain  
,  
with  
certain  
areas  >>ARG1
getting*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
soaking*  
as  
many  
as  
270  
days  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
year  
.  

County  
Kerry  >ARG1
is*  
the  
worst  
affected  <ARG2
.  

The  
southeast  >>ARG0
is*  
the  
driest  <ARG2
,  
enjoying*  
a  
more  
continental  
climate  <ARG1
.  

The  
Irish  
weather  
works  
on  
the  
‘  
four  
seasons  
in  
a  
day  
’  
principle  
,  
which  
basic­ally  
means  
that  
you  
ca  
n’t  
predict  
a  
thing  
when  
it  
comes  
to  
the  
behaviour  
of  
the  
sky  
.  

Some  
basic  >ARGM-ADJ
assumptions*  >>ARGM-PRR
,  
however  
,  
can  
be*  
made*  
.  

In  
summer  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
from  
May  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
July  
,  
the  
days  >>ARG1
are*  
reasonably  >ARGM-EXT
warm*  
and  
–  
most  
importantly  >ARGM-ADV
–  
very  >ARGM-EXT
long*  
:  
at  
the  
height  >ARGM-TMP
of  
summer  
you  >>ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n’t  >ARGM-NEG
need*  
to  
turn*  
on  
lights  <ARG1
until  
after  
10  
pm  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
also  <ARGM-DIS
peak  
tourist  
season  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
means*  
there  
are*  
far  
more  
people  <ARG1
just  
about  
everywhere  <ARGM-LOC
but  
the  
most  
remote  
corners  
of  
the  
island  
,  
and  
prices*  >ARG1
are*  
at  
their  
highest  <ARG2
.  

Not  
surprisingly  >ARGM-ADV
,  
most  >ARG1
of  
the  
yearly  
festivals  
occur*  
during  
these  
times  <ARGM-TMP
so  
as  
to  
take*  
advantage  <ARG1
of  
the  
crowds  <ARG2
and  
the  
more  
favourable  
weather  
.  

Spring  >ARG1
(  
February  
to  
April  
)  
and  
Autumn  
(  
August  
to  
October  
)  
make*  
good  
alternatives  <ARG2
,  
although  
the  
country  
’s  
ever  
-  
growing  
popularity  >ARG0
as  
a  
tourist  
destination  
can  >ARGM-MOD
often  >ARGM-TMP
blur*  
the  
lines  <ARG1
between  
mid  
-  
and  
high  
-  
season  
tourism  
.  

Still  >ARGM-ADV
,  
you  >ARG0
have*  
a  
better  >ARGM-ADJ
chance*  
of  
some  
peace*  
and  
quiet  
,  
and  
the  
weather  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
surprisingly  
better  <ARG2
in  
April  <ARGM-TMP
and  
September  
than  
in  
mid-July  <C-ARG2
–  
again  >ARGM-ADV
,  
it  >ARG1
’s*  
all  <ARGM-ADV
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
uncertainty  
principle  
.  

Spring  
festivities  >ARG2
include*  
the  
ever  
-  
popular  
St  
Patrick  
’s  
Festival  <ARG1
.  

Although  
temperatures  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
often  >ARGM-TMP
venture*  >>ARGM-ADV
below  
freezing*  
,  
winter  >>ARG0
(  
December  
to  
February  
)  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
brutal*  
,  
for  
huge  
parts  <ARG2
of  
the  
country  
–  
the  
west  
and  
northwest  
in  
particular  
.  

Crowds  >ARG1
are*  
at  
their  
thinnest  <ARG2
,  
but  
many  >>ARG1
of  
the  
country  >>ARG0
’s  
tourist  >ARG1
attractions*  
and  
services*  
close*  
down  
in  
October  <ARGM-TMP
and  
do*  
n’t  >ARGM-NEG
reopen*  
until  
Easter  <ARGM-TMP
,  
which  >ARG0
paradoxically  >ARGM-ADV
leaves*  
visitors  <ARG1
with  
a  
more  
convincing  >ARGM-ADJ
taste*  
of  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
Ireland  >>ARG1
is*  
experienced*  
by  
most  <ARG0
of  
the  
Irish  
:  
it  >>ARG1
’s*  
cold*  
,  
grey*  
and  
dark*  
by  
5  
pm  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
there  
’s*  
always  <ARGM-TMP
a  
pub  >ARGM-GOL
to  
escape*  
into  <C-ARGM-GOL
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
rain  >>ARG1
starts*  
sheeting*  
down  <ARGM-PRD
.  

The  
thing  >>ARG1
to  
do*  
is*  
to  
bring*  
the  
right  
clothing  <ARG1
with  
you  <ARGM-COM
,  
clothes  
so  
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
layer*  
up  <ARGM-ADV
if  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
cold*  
and  
take*  
off  
layers  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
warms*  
up  
.  

Waterproof  
clothing  >>ARG1
and  
footwear  
are*  
essential*  
plus  
an  
umbrella  <C-ARG1
..  

As  
that  
famous  
Scotsman  >ARG0
Billy  
Connolly  
says*  >ARGM-ADV
"  
there  
is*  
no  
such  
thing  <ARG1
as  
bad  
weather  
just  
the  
wrong  
clothes  
"  

Afraid  
I  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
more  >ARGM-ADV
helpful*  
,  
it  >ARG1
is*  
really  <ARGM-ADV
a  
case*  
of  
pot  
luck  <ARG1
,  
although  
as  
the  
weather  >ARG1
is*  
so  
changeable  >ARGM-CAU
often  >ARGM-TMP
a  
cold  
wet  
morning  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
turn*  
into  
a  
lovely  
warm  
sunny  
afternoon  <ARG2
and  
evening  
or  
visa  
versa  
.  

If  
you  >ARG1
mean*  
the  
Republic  <ARG2
of  
Ireland  
(  
Dublin  
)  
then  
anytime  
.  

The  
summer  >>ARG1
there  
is*  
much  
more  >ARGM-CXN
mild*  
than  
most  <C-ARGM-CXN
of  
the  
US  
(  
are*  
you  >ARG1
coming*  
from  
the  
US  <ARG3
?  
)  
.  

Their  
seasons  >ARG1
are*  
the  
same  <ARG2
as  
all  
the  
countries  
in  
the  
Northern  
Hemisphere  
but  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
suggest*  
fall  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
does*  
get*  
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
cold*  
in  
Ireland  <ARGM-LOC
so  >>ARGM-ADV
going*  >ARG1
before  
winter  <ARGM-TMP
is*  
your  >ARG0
best  >ARGM-ADJ
bet*  
.  

September  
for  
example  
.  

Rent*  
a  
car  <ARG1
and  
spend*  
a  
couple  
days  <ARG1
outside  
of  
Dublin  <ARGM-LOC
seeing*  
the  
countryside  <ARG1
and  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
the  
trip*  
of  
a  
lifetime  <ARGM-TMP
.  

To  
explore*  >ARGM-PRP
the  
beautiful  
countryside  <ARG1
you  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
to  
be*  
old*  
enough  <ARGM-CXN
to  
hire*  
a  
car  <ARG1
because  
public  >ARGM-ADJ
transport*  >>ARG1
is*  
expensive*  
&  
only  >ARGM-ADV
goes*  
as  
far  <ARG4
as  
the  
main  
towns  
/  
cities  
,  
most  
rural  
places  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
have*  
a  
bus  >ARG1
or  
train  
service*  
.  

You  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
stay*  
in  
a  
city  <ARG3
&  
get*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
bus  >ARGM-MNR
tour*  
to  
say  
the  
Cliffs  <ARG1
of  
Moher  
or  
Dingle  
peninsula  
but  
you  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
with  
all  
the  
other  
tourists  <ARG2
.  

By  
definition*  >ARGM-MNR
most  
tourists  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
to  
the  
best  
places  <ARG4
so  
you  >>ARG0
might  
have*  
to  
put*  
up  
with  
a  
few  
tourists  <ARG1
along  
the  
way*  
.  

Best  
weather  >>ARG1
the  
past  
couple  
of  
years  
has*  
been*  
around  
late  
April  <ARG2
-  
late  
May  
but  
it  
can  >ARGM-MOD
pour*  
with  
rain  <ARGM-MNR
for  
days  <ARGM-TMP
on  
end  
at  
any  
time  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
year  
so  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
prepared  <ARG2
with  
waterproof  
jackets  <ARGM-MNR
/  
boots  
etc  <ARGM-MNR
.  

We  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
had*  
a  
few  
sunny  
days  <ARG1
this  
summer  <ARGM-TMP
,  
barely  
24  
C  
on  
a  
few  >ARGM-ADJ
occasions*  
,  
more  
like  
14  
C  
most  
days  
.  

We  >ARG0
used*  
our  
BBQ  <ARG1
on  
precisely  
4  
occasions*  
.  

Autumn  >ARG1
is*  
from  
mid  
August  <ARG2
onwards  
as  
far  <ARGM-ADV
as  
the  
weather  >ARG1
goes*  
if  
not  
officially  <<ARGM-ADV
according  
to  
the  
calender  
.  

The  
days  >>ARG1
start*  
to  
shorten*  
&  
it  >>ARG1
gets*  
even  >ARGM-ADV
wetter  <ARG2
,  
windier  
&  
colder*  
.  

We  >>ARGM-GOL
had*  >ARGM-LVB
frosts*  
in  
October  <ARGM-TMP
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
advise*  
visiting*  
late  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
year  
to  
be*  
honest*  
,  
Spring  
time  >ARG1
is*  
your  >ARG0
best  >ARGM-ADJ
bet*  
.  

You  >>ARG0
do*  
realise*  
it  
is*  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
expensive*  
to  
visit*  
Ireland  <ARG1
?  

You  >>ARG0
are*  
going*  
to  
need*  
a  
few  
thousand  
dollars  >ARG1
saved*  
up  
for  
flights*  
,  
insurance  
,  
food  
,  
accommodation*  
&  
spending  
money  
.  

Eating*  >>ARG1
out  <ARGM-LOC
in  
particular  >>ARGM-ADV
is*  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
expensive*  >ARG1
compared  
to  
America  <ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
believe*  
.  

Golden  
Wonder  
KilliFish  >>ARG2
Breeding*  >ARG1
Help*  
?  

I  >ARG0
have*  
4  
Golden  
Wonder  
Killifish  <ARG1
.  

1  >>ARG1
of  
them  
is*  
really  
colorful  <ARG2
and  
is*  
about  
6  
cm  >ARG2
long*  
.  

2  >>ARG1
of  
them  
are*  
kinda  
whitish  <ARG2
and  
are*  
about  
4  
-  
5  
cm  >ARG2
long*  
.  

The  
last  
one  >ARG1
is*  
colourful  <ARG2
too  <ARGM-DIS
but  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
about  
4  
cm  >ARG2
long*  
.  

I  >ARG0
feed*  
them  <ARG2
Flakes  <ARG1
,  
and  
Live  
Earthworms  
uncut  
everyday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
tell*  
me  <ARG2
the  
whole  >ARGM-ADJ
process*  
of  
breeding*  
them  <ARG1
and  
taking*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
the  
babies  <ARG1
?  

Thanks*  
in  
Advance*  
.  

Wow  
!  

If  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
able*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
take*  
earthworms  <ARG1
uncut  <ARGM-PRD
,  
that  >>ARG0
is*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
impressive*  
!  

I  >ARG0
aspire*  
to  
your  
feeding  
regime  <ARG1
,  
flakes  
early  
and  
something  
live  
later  
in  
the  
day  
.  

Worms  >>ARG0
(  
and  
Daphnia  
)  
are*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
rich*  
in  
Lipids  <ARG2
,  
substances  
important  
in  
forming*  
eggs  <ARG1
and  
growing*  
young  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
that  
you  >ARG0
understand*  
that  
your  
largest  
and  
smallest  
golden  
wonders  >ARG1
are*  
males  <ARG2
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  >>ARGM-ADV
more  <ARG1
on  
sexing*  
out  <ARGM-PRD
Aplocheilus  
lineatus  <ARG1
take*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
look*  
at  
the  
discussion*  
in  
the  
first  
source  <ARGM-LOC
below  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
have*  
plants  <ARG1
in  
your  
tank  
.  

your  
lineatus  >>ARG0
are*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
spawning*  
.  

If  
conditions  >ARG1
are*  
favorable  >>ARGM-ADV
(  
78  
-  
82  
F  
)  
and  
the  
fish  >ARG1
are*  
obviously  <ARGM-ADV
well  
fed  <ARG2
as  
yours  >ARG1
are*  
,  
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
spawn*  
.  

(  
I  >>ARG0
've*  
even  >ARGM-ADV
had*  
a  
pair  >ARG0
of  
killies  
leave*  
eggs  <ARG1
on  
a  
floating  
thermometer  <ARG2
!  

If  
you  >>ARG0
wish*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
pick*  
eggs  <ARG1
make*  
a  
acrylic  
spawning  
mop  <ARG1
.  

Check*  
out  
the  
second  
source  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
prefer*  
darker  
colors  <ARG1
because  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see*  
their  
eggs  <ARG1
,  
more  
easily  <ARGM-ADV
and  
the  
fish  >>ARG1
look*  
better*  
next  <ARGM-LOC
to  
them  
.  

Use*  
a  
well  >ARGM-MNR
rinsed*  
medicine  
vial  <ARG2
,  
a  
cork  
,  
new  
fishing  
bobber  
or  
even  
a  
piece  
of  
non-crumbly  
styrofoam  
to  
float*  
them  <ARG1
.  

There  
are*  
a  
couple  
ways  >ARGM-MNR
one  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
spawn*  
lineatus  <ARG1
-  
mop  >ARGM-MNR
spawning*  
&  
water  >ARG2
incubating*  
them  <ARG1
for  
two  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
,  
picking*  
eggs  <ARG1
from  
a  
mop  <ARG2
&  
putting*  
them  <ARG1
in  
a  
tray  <ARG2
of  
treated  
,  
seasoned  
water  
or  
setting*  
up  
the  
parents  <ARG1
in  
a  
planted*  
tank  <ARG1
&  
moving*  
them  <ARG1
so  
the  
fry  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
hatch*  
out  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
have*  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
room  >>ARGM-LOC
to  
separate*  
the  
male  <ARG1
(  
s  
)  
&  
females  
(  
s  
)  
,  
&  
feed*  
them  <ARG2
well  <ARGM-MNR
on  
live  
foods  <ARG1
,  
(  
assuming*  >>ARGM-ADV
that  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
doing*  
weekly  >ARGM-TMP
50  
%  >ARGM-EXT
water  >ARG1
changes*  
)  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
put*  >ARGM-TMP
them  <ARG1
together  <ARG2
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
leave*  
a  
lot  
more  
eggs  <ARG1
.  

Just  >ARGM-ADV
making*  
up  
examples  <ARG1
,  
but  
if  
a  
pair  >ARG1
is*  
constantly  <ARGM-TMP
together  >ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
lay*  
10  
-  
15  
eggs  <ARG1
a  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

With  
extra  
blackworms  >>ARGM-MNR
and  
maybe  
frozen  
(  
defrosted*  
,  
rinsed*  
)  
frozen  
foods  <ARG2
earlier  
in  
the  
day  
,  
they  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
leave*  
30  
-  
40  
eggs  <ARG1
at  
a  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Separated*  >>ARGM-ADV
and  
feed*  
extremely  
nourishing  
stuff  <ARG1
,  
they  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
produce*  
more  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Separating*  >>ARG0
a  
pair  <ARG1
some  
time  
before  
a  
show*  
(  
killies  >>ARG1
are*  
usually  >>ARGM-TMP
shown*  
&  
judged*  
&  
often  >ARGM-TMP
sold*  
as  
pairs  <ARGM-PRD
)  
will  >ARGM-MOD
encourage*  
them  >>ARG0
to  
court*  
and  
show*  
their  
best  
colors  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
start*  
the  
day  <ARG1
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
nicks  <ARGM-MNR
or  
dings*  
in  
their  
fins  <ARG1
.  

The  
water  >ARG1
changes*  >ARG0
help*  
with  
that  <ARG1
too  <ARGM-DIS
.  

You  >>ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
may  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
to  
treat*  
the  
incubation  
water  <ARG1
.  

The  
chlorine  >>ARG1
and  
ammonia  
(  
choramine  
)  
are*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
good*  
for  
the  
eggs  <ARG2
.  

Ironically  >>ARGM-ADV
sometimes  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG0
is*  
wise*  
to  
leave*  
the  
newly  
picked  
eggs  <ARG1
in  
fresh  
tap  
water  <ARG1
with  
some  
chlorination*  
to  
kill*  
microscopic  
critters  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
ride*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
with  
the  
eggs  <ARG1
.  

THEN  >ARGM-TMP
put*  
the  
eggs  >>ARG0
in  
water  >ARG1
treated*  
a  
couple  
of  
days  
before  <ARGM-TMP
with  
a  
water  >ARG2
treatment*  
and  
left*  
open*  
to  
"  
breathe*  
"  
.  

Leaving*  >ARG0
a  
jar  <ARG1
with  
a  
dozen  
black  
worms  
in  
it  
will  >ARGM-MOD
sate*  
the  
adult  
's  
desire  <ARG1
for  
snacks  
and  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
more  >ARGM-EXT
likely*  
to  
leave*  
fry  >ARG1
or  
eggs  
alone*  
.  

If  
a  
pair  >>ARG0
is*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
leaving*  >ARGM-ADV
eggs  <ARG1
...  
check*  
the  
following  <ARG1
:  

1  
.  
Is*  
a  
tank  
mate  >ARG0
(  
such  
as  
another

rating*  
the

3  
.  
Is*  
there

Aplo.  
lineatus  >>ARG1

wide*

That  >ARG0

that  
they  >ARG1

Still  
if

water  >>ARG0
treated*  
a  
couple  
of  
days  
before  <ARGM-TMP
with  
a  
water  >ARG2
treatment*  
and  
left*  
open*  
to  
"  
breathe*  
"  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
get*  >>ARGM-ADV
eggs  <ARG1
in  
the  
mail  <ARGM-MNR
in  
a  
medicine  
vial  <ARGM-MNR
,  
that  >>ARG1
is*  
fine*  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
get*  
the  
eggs  <ARG1
out  <ARG2
,  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
rinsed*  
in  
fresh  
tap  
water  <ARGM-LOC
and  
then  
into  
the  
incubation  
water  <ARGM-LOC
.  

In  
time  >ARGM-TMP
the  
eggs  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
suffocate*  
in  
the  
shipping  
container  <ARGM-LOC
.  

After  
a  
number  >ARG1
of  
people  
began*  >>ARGM-TMP
complaining  <C-ARG1
about  
"  
mystery  >ARGM-ADJ
deaths*  
"  
among  
incubating  
eggs  
,  
some  >>ARG0
of  
the  
more  
advanced  
killie  
people  
began*  
suggesting*  
that  
after  
7  
-  
8  
days  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
incubation*  
,  
one  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
a  
100  
%  >ARGM-EXT
water  >ARG1
change*  
-  
as  
the  
eggs  >ARG2
develop*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
release*  
waste  
material  <ARG1
.  

Another  
problem  >ARG1
is*  
that  
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
bad  
eggs  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
fungus*  
and  
the  
fungus  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
spread*  
out  
and  
kill*  
all  
the  
eggs  <ARG1
.  

Some  
people  >>ARG0
put*  
in  <ARG2
a  
very  
dilute  
Acriflaven  
solution  <ARG1
to  
slow*  
down  
the  
fungus  <ARG1
,  
so  
one  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
white  
eggs  <ARG1
out  <ARGM-DIR
with  
a  
pipette  <ARGM-MNR
or  
eyedropper  
.  

Other  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
add*  
a  
drop  <ARG1
of  
Methylene  
blue  
.  

If  
an  
egg  >>ARG1
turns*  >>ARGM-ADV
blue*  
,  
it  >>ARG1
had*  
died*  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
became*  
dyed  <ARG2
as  
the  
outer  
membrane  >ARG1
broke*  
down  
.  

Get*  
those  <ARG1
out  <ARG2
ASAP  <ARGM-TMP
too  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Hope*  
there  
is*  
useful  
grist  <ARG1
for  
the  
mill  
here  
.

Disney  
cruises  >ARG1

is*  
a  
simple  >ARGM-ADJ
answer*  
to  
this  <ARG1
.  

There  
are*  
many  
reasons  >ARGM-ADV

say*  
Disney

From

The

special  
regions  >ARG1
uniquely  >ARGM-ADV

imposingly

They  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
spend*  
many  
hours  <ARG1
enjoying*  
the  
Disney

magic  <ARG1
.  

These

Video  >ARG3
shows*  
,  
cartoon

wonderful  
games  
and  
many  
such  
facilities  
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
really  <ARGM-ADV
an  
entertainment  <ARG2
for  
the  
kids  
.  

The  
amusing  
world  >ARG1
of  
cartoons  
and  
stories  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
memorable  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
for  
the  
children  <ARG0

There  
are*  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
amnesties*  
also  <<ARGM-DIS
.  

These  >ARG2
include*  
space  <ARG1
for  
dances*

music  
,  
bar  
facility  
,  
gambling

the  
elder  
,  
spaciously  
made  
open  
area  
aboard  
and  
many  
such  
nice  
facilities  
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
one  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
keep*  
their  
privacy  <ARG1
in  
the  
cabins  <ARGM-LOC
and  
make*  
the  
time  <ARG1
in  
seclusion*  
.  

To  
relax*  >>ARGM-PRP
and  
to  
rejuvenate*  
Disney  
cruise  >ARG1
are*  
the  
best  
option  <ARG2
.  

There  
are*  
many  
online  
sites  >ARG0
offering*  
the  
booking  
facility  <ARG1
with  
affordable  
rates  
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
select*  
the  
proper  
route  <ARG1
and  
travel  >ARG1
plans*  
by  
consulting*  
the  
agents  <ARG1
prior  
to  
the  
booking  <ARGM-TMP
........  

Off  
season  >>ARG1
is*  
good*  
,  
however  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
Disney  
cruises  >ARG1
are*  
almost  
ALWAYS  <ARGM-TMP
completely  
booked  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
suggest*  
a  
warmer  
season  <ARG1
,  
but  
not  
Spring  >ARG2
Break*  
or  
early  
summer  
.  

You  >>ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
want*  
to  
avoid*  
Thanksgiving  
week  <ARG1
and  
the  
Christmas  >ARG3
holidays*  
.  

We  >ARG0
REALLY  >ARGM-ADV
enjoyed*  
our  
balcony  <ARG1
--  
coffee  
in  
the  
mornings  
,  
drinks  
at  
night  
,  
standing*  
outside  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
docking*  
and  
leaving*  
port  <ARG1
--  
however  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
quite  
a  
bit  
more  >ARGM-EXT
expensive*  
.  

With  
young  
ones  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
get*  
a  
window  <ARG1
or  
view  
room  
so  
they  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see*  
outside  <ARGM-DIR
.  

Check*  
out  
the  
kids  
'  
space  <ARG1
as  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
as  
you  >ARG1
get*  
onboard  <ARG2
.  

Do*  
NOT  >>ARGM-NEG
feel*  
guilty*  
about  
taking*  
them  <ARG1
there  <ARG3
.  

They  >>ARG0
have*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
BLAST*  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
sooner  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG1
get*  >>ARGM-TMP
there  <ARG2
,  
the  
sooner  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  >ARGM-LVB
fun*  
.  

We  >ARG0
liked*  
getting*  
the  
late  
dinner  
seating  <ARG1
,  
so  
you  >>ARG0
have*  
more  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
see*  
movies  <ARG1
and  
stuff  
but  
if  
your  
kids  >ARG1
are*  
'  
early  >ARGM-ADV
to  
bed  
'  
you  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
want*  
the  
earlier  
seating  <ARG1
for  
dinners  
.  

Bring*  
some  
sort  <ARG1
of  
magnet  
or  
small  
magnetic  
whiteboard  
for  
your  
door  
.  

All  >>ARG1
of  
the  
doors  
tend*  
to  
look*  
alike*  
and  
having*  >ARG0
'  
something  <ARG1
'  
on  
your  
door  
helps*  
you  >ARG0
and  
your  
kids  
find*  
your  
room  <ARG1
easier  <ARGM-MNR
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
leave*  
notes  <ARG1
for  
the  
rest  <ARG2
of  
your  
family  
(  
husband  
)  
about  
where  >ARG2
you  >ARG1
are*  
at  
any  
given  
point  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Cell  
phones  >>ARG1
do*  
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
work*  
on  
board  <ARGM-LOC
but  
they  >ARG0
give*  
you  <ARG2
a  
'  
walkie  
-  
talkie  
'  
kind  >ARG1
of  
phone  
in  
your  
room  
that  >R-ARG1
WILL  >ARGM-MOD
work*  
onboard  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Each  
evening  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
a  
'  
magazine  >>ARG0
'  
called*  
The  
Navigator  <ARG2
which  >R-ARG0
lists*  
all  <ARG1
of  
the  
activities  
for  
the  
next  
day  
.  

We  >>ARG0
always  >>ARGM-TMP
took*  
ours  <ARG1
to  
dinner  <ARG3
and  
discussed*  
what  
things  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
felt*  
we  >>ARG0
'  
had*  
'  
to  
do*  
and  
which  
ones  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
felt*  
like  
skipping*  
in  
lieu  <ARGM-ADV
of  
just  >ARGM-ADV
chilling*  
.  

Any  
time  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
great*  
.  

off  
season  
cruises  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
better*  
with  
preschoolers  <ARGM-COM
as  
prices*  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
lower*  
in  
the  
off  
season  <ARGM-TMP
.  

My  
wife  >ARG0
and  
I  
,  
in  
our  
60's  
at  
the  
time  
,  
originally  >ARGM-ADV
planned*  
a  
3  
generation  >ARG0
trip*  
but  
some  
family  
emergencies  >ARG0
caused*  
everyone  >ARG0
else  
to  
cancel*  
.  

We  >ARG0
had*  
a  
ball  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
had*  
an  
inside  
cabin  <ARG1
and  
it  >ARG1
is*  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
.  

There  
are*  
so  
many  
things  >ARG1
to  
do*  
that  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
use*  
your  
room  <ARG1
for  
sleeping*  
and  
the  
extra  
cost  >>ARG1
of  
the  
balcony  
is*  
wasted*  
.  

The  
children  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
checked*  
in  <ARG1
and  
checked*  
out  <ARG1
in  
a  
safe  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  
at  
many  
activities  <<ARGM-LOC
so  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
a  
bit  <ARG1
of  
free  
time  
without  
the  
little  
ones  
.  

The  
range  >>ARG1
of  
activities  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
illustrated*  
by  
describing*  
the  
water  
activities  <ARG1
.  

There  
is*  
a  
splash  
fountain  <ARG1
(  
no  
standing  
water  
)  
for  
little  
ones  
still  
in  
diapers  
;  
Next  >ARG2
is*  
a  
wading  
pool  <ARG1
for  
those  >ARG1
who  >R-ARG1
are*  
potty  
trained  <ARG2
;  
Then  
a  
family  
pool  
;  
Finally  >ARGM-ADV
there  
is*  
a  
pool  <ARG1
for  
adults  
only  
with  
kids  >ARG1
not  >ARGM-NEG
allowed*  
.  

You  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
so  
spoiled  <ARG2
in  
your  
life  <ARGM-TMP
as  
you  >ARG1
are*  
on  
a  
Disney  
Cruise  <ARGM-LOC
.  

If  
you  >ARG1
stay*  >ARGM-ADV
with  
your  
dining  
schedule  <ARG3
,  
every  
night  >ARG1
is*  
dinner  <ARG2
and  
a  
show*  
.  

The  
real  
payoff  >ARG1
is*  
that  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
the  
same  
waiter  <ARG1
for  
the  
entire  
cruise  
.  

Our  
waiter  >ARG0
quickly  >ARGM-TMP
grasped*  
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
I  >ARG0
like*  
Ginger  
ale  <ARG1
and  
rather  
spicy  
foods  
while  
my  
wife  >ARG0
's  
taste*  >ARG1
ran*  
to  
lemonade  <ARG4
and  
less  
spicy  
fare  
.  

Since  
they  >ARG0
knew*  >>ARGM-CAU
our  >ARG0
preferences*  
,  
we  >>ARG1
almost  
always  >>ARGM-TMP
went*  
along  <ARG2
with  
their  >ARG0
menu  >ARG1
suggestions*  
and  
were*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
sorry*  
we  
did*  
.  

Obviously  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG0
had*  
a  
full  
beverage  
list  >ARG2
including*  
alcohol  <ARG1
for  
adults  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
wanted*  
it  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
miss*  
a  
meal  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
missed*  
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
show*  
.  

but  
food  >>ARG2
is*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
available*  
and  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
consistently  >ARGM-MNR
good*  
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
I  >ARG0
gained*  
three  
pounds  <ARG1
in  
my  
week  
long  
cruise  <ARGM-TMP
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
about  
my  
farrier  <ARG2
,  
girls  <ARGM-DIS
.  

That  >ARG1
's*  
why  >>ARGM-CAU
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
posting*  
here  <ARG2
!  

Help*  
?  

I  >ARG0
posted*  
this  <ARG1
in  
singles  <ARG2
and  
dating*  
too  <<ARGM-DIS
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
've*  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
copied*  
and  
pasted*  
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
try*  
to  
make*  
this  >ARG1
short*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
known*  
this  
guy  <ARG1
for  
a  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
we  >>ARG1
've*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
been*  
good  
friends  <ARG2
or  
anything  
.  

He  >ARG1
is*  
my  
farrier  <ARG2
(  
shoes*  
my  
horse  
s  
feet  <ARG1
)  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG1
am*  
technically  <ARGM-ADV
a  
client  <ARG2
if  
you  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
view*  
it  <ARG1
that  
way*  
.  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
almost  
two  
weeks  
ago  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG1
came*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
and  
did*  
my  
horse  
s  
feet  <ARG1
and  
was*  
SO  
flirty  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
hugs*  
me  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG1
comes*  
,  
but  
he  >>ARG0
gave*  >ARGM-LVB
me  >ARG1
at  
least  
5  >ARGM-ADJ
tight  >ARGM-MNR
,  
long  >ARGM-ADJ
,  
back  
rubbing  >ARGM-MNR
hugs*  
while  
he  >ARG1
was*  
there  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG0
were*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
just  >ARGM-ADV
talking*  
about  
my  
horse  
's  
crappy  
feet  <ARG1
and  
he  >ARG0
mentioned*  
.  

"  
Well  
,  
if  
you  >>ARG0
ever  >ARGM-TMP
just  >ARGM-ADV
want*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
see*  
me  <ARG1
I  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
come*  
out  
and  
look*  
him  <ARG1
over  <C-V
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
grab*  
a  
coffee  <ARG1
after  <ARGM-TMP
.  
"  

That  >>ARG1
has*  
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
happened*  
before  <ARGM-TMP
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
was*  
kinda  >ARGM-EXT
realizing*  
at  
that  
point  <ARGM-TMP
that  
he  >>ARG1
was*  
a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
interested*  
.  

Right  
??  

Anyway  >ARGM-DIS
,  
so  >ARGM-DIS
he  >>ARG0
ended*  
up  
leaving*  
one  
nail  <ARG1
out  
of  
my  
horse  
s  
foot  <ARG2
(  
I  >>ARG0
've*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
heard*  
of  
a  
farrier  >ARG0
doing*  
this  <ARG1
)  
and  
telling*  
me  >ARG0
to  
call*  
him  <ARG1
in  
a  
few  
days  <ARGM-TMP
(  
first  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
was*  
a  
week  <ARG2
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
was*  
a  
few  
days  <ARG2
lol  <ARGM-DIS
)  
and  
he  >>ARG0
'd  >>ARGM-MOD
come*  
back  
out  <ARG4
and  
put*  
it  <ARG1
in  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
told*  
me  >>ARG0
to  
remember*  
to  
call*  
like  <ARGM-DIS
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
before  
he  >ARG0
left*  
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
waited*  
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
to  
call*  
because  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
busy*  
and  
I  >>ARG0
wanted*  
to  
have*  
him  >ARG1
come*  
out  
on  
a  
day  <ARGM-TMP
when  
I  >>ARG2
am*  
more  >ARGM-EXT
available*  
in  
case  
we  >ARG1
were*  
to  
hang*  
out  
after  <ARGM-TMP
;)  

Anyway  
,  
so  >ARGM-DIS
that  >ARG1
was*  
2  
days  
ago  >>ARGM-TMP
that  >>R-ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
called*  
and  
left*  
a  
message  <ARG1
,  
but  
he  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
has*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
called*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
yet  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
if  
I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
call*  
him  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
tomorrow  <ARGM-TMP
or  
not  
?  

I  >ARG0
know*  
a  
lot  >>ARG1
of  
people  
say*  
to  
wait*  
until  
he  >ARG0
calls*  
you  <ARG1
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
different*  
because  
I  >ARG1
'm*  
a  
client  <ARG2
and  
technically  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG1
's*  
all  >ARG2
I  >ARG1
am*  
at  
this  
point  <ARGM-TMP
.  

On  
the  
other  
hand  >>ARGM-ADV
though  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
I  >ARG1
'm*  
a  
client  >>ARGM-ADV
he  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
really  >>ARGM-ADV
of*  
called*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
by  
now  <ARGM-TMP
because  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
leave*  
a  
customer  >ARG1
hanging*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
my  
number  <ARG1
either  <ARGM-ADV
because  
this  >ARG1
was*  
the  
first  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
've*  
called*  
HIM  <ARG1
instead  
of  
his  
dad  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
a  
father  
and  
son  
business  <ARG2
.  

Anyway  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
appreciate*  
ANY  
insight  <ARG1
on  
this  
at  
all  
.  

Thank*  
you  <ARG1
for  
reading*  
if  
you  
did*  
!  
:)  

Ok  
,  
well  
as  
far  >>ARGM-ADV
as  
him  >ARG1
being*  
a  
bad  
farrier  <ARG2
for  
leaving*  
a  
nail  <ARG1
out  <C-V
-  
That  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
case*  
,  
they  >ARG1
are*  
extremely  
well  
known  
farriers  <ARG2
in  
the  
area  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
lot  
more  >ARGM-EXT
concerned*  
if  
the  
shoe  >ARG1
fell*  
off  <ARGM-DIR
because  
it  >>ARG0
was*  
missing*  
one  
lousy  
nail  <ARG1
.  

The  
reason  >>ARG1
he  >ARG0
said*  
he  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
put*  
that  
nail  <ARG1
in  <ARG2
was*  
because  
he  >>ARG0
"  
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
risk*  
it  <ARG1
"  
with  
my  
horse  
's  
horrible  
feet  <ARGM-CAU
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
about  
the  
fourth  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
've*  
done*  
my  
horse  
's  
feet  <ARG1
because  
I  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-TMP
switched*  
back  <ARGM-ADV
to  
them  <ARG2
.  

The  
only  
reason  >>ARG1
I  >ARG1
switched*  
away  <ARG3
from  
them  
in  
the  
first  
place  <ARGM-ADV
is*  
because  
my  
good  
friend  >>ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
apprenticed*  
with  
them  <ARG2
was*  
starting*  
out  
on  
his  
own  <ARGM-MNR
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >ARG0
left*  
my  
horse  <ARG1
without  
a  
shoe  <ARG1
for  
TWO  
WEEKS  <ARGM-TMP
(  
now  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG1
's*  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
call*  
a  
crap  
farrier  <ARG2
)  
.  

Which  >>ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
add*  
is*  
the  
same  
foot  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
keeps*  
crumbling*  
with  
the  
nails  <ARGM-ADV
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
,  
obviously  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
switched*  
back  <ARG2
to  
these  
guys  
.  

Ok  >ARGM-DIS
,  
calm*  
down  
,  
it  >ARG1
's*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
like  
he  >ARG1
's*  
some  
stranger  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
came*  
up  
and  
groped*  
me  <ARG1
lol  <<ARGM-DIS
.  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
known*  
the  
guy  <ARG1
for  
about  
10  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG1
am*  
21  <ARG2
,  
so  >ARGM-DIS
yeah  >ARGM-DIS
we  >ARG1
were*  
both  <ARGM-ADV
kids  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
knew*  
each  
other  <ARG1
!  

He  >>ARG1
is*  
a  
few  
years  >ARGM-EXT
older*  
than  
me  <ARGM-CXN
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
like*  
him  <ARG1
.  

To  
answer*  >>ARGM-PRP
Barry  <ARG1
White  
,  
yes  >>ARGM-DIS
that  >>ARG1
did*  
occur*  
to  
me  <ARG2
:)  
I  >ARG0
hope*  
that  >ARG1
is*  
all  >>ARG2
he  >>ARG1
's*  
waiting*  
for  <C-ARG2
.  

On  
the  
other  
hand  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
very  
easily  >>ARGM-MNR
just  >>ARGM-ADV
call*  
me  <ARG1
and  
say*  
hey  >>ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
busy*  
right  
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
call*  
you  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
come*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
as  
far  >>ARGM-ADV
as  
scheduled  >ARGM-ADJ
visits*  >ARG1
go*  
,  
I  >ARG0
have*  
no  
idea  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
done*  
that  <ARG1
before  <ARGM-TMP
though  <ARGM-DIS
either  <ARGM-DIS
.  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
always  <ARGM-TMP
just  <ARGM-ADV
"  
Okay  
,  
they're  
feet  >ARG0
need*  
to  
be*  
done*  
,  
better  
call*  
the  
farrier  <ARG1
.  
"  

And  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG1
usually  >ARGM-ADV
come*  
out  
within  
a  
few  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
call*  
you  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
I  >>ARG0
m*  
sure*  
!  

Sounds*  
like  
He  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-EXT
likes*  
you  <ARG1
..  

But  >ARGM-DIS
you  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
ask*  
yourself  <ARG2
do*  
you  >ARG0
feel*  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  
?  

would  >ARGM-MOD
You  >>ARG0
like*  
going*  
for  
*  
coffee  <ARG1
*  
with  
him  <ARGM-COM
?  

or  
is*  
he  <ARG1
Not  <ARGM-NEG
your  
type  <ARG2
?  

Or  >>ARGM-DIS
are*  
you  >ARG0
undecided*  
?  

If  
i  >ARG1
were*  
you  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
Go*  
...  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
if  
he  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
call*  >ARGM-ADV
you  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
by  
friday  <ARGM-TMP
call*  
him  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
playing*  
hard*  
to  
get*  
?  

I  >ARG0
think*  
he  >>ARG0
left*  
the  
Nail  <ARG1
out  
of  
the  
shoe  <ARG2
as  
a  
excuse*  >>ARGM-CAU
to  
come*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
and  
see*  
you  <ARG1
hey  
he  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
your  
Prince  
charming  <ARG2
..  

Edit  
...  
I  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
Your  
horse  >ARG1
Is*  
in  
danger  <ARG2
Of  
being*  
hurt*  
With  
one  
Nail  >ARG1
missing*  
..  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
seen*  
horses  >>ARG0
Loose*  
Nails  <ARG1
On  
there  
Own  <ARGM-MNR
And  
do*  
just  
fine  <ARGM-MNR
with  
ONE  
nail  >ARG0
gone*  
Now  >>ARGM-TMP
if  
he  >>ARG0
had*  
left*  >>ARGM-ADV
out  
2  <ARG1
or  
3  
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
wondering*  
to  <ARG1
...  

I  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
belive*  
he  >ARG0
left*  
the  
nail  <ARG1
out  <C-V
becuse  
of  
the  
horse  
s  
Hoof  
condition  <ARGM-CAU
and  
It  
s*  
a  
added  
bonus  <ARG2
he  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
to  
see*  
her  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP

When  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG1
was*  
Younger*  >ARGM-TMP
In  
my  
early  
20s  >ARGM-TMP
My  
farrier  >ARG1
was*  
A  
hottie  >ARG1
named*  
Joby  <ARG2
..  
(  
for  
those  >>ARGM-ADV
who  >>R-ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
Know*  
I  >ARG1
AM*  
A  
GIRL  <ARG2
read*  
my  
Bio  <ARG1
on  
my  
Page  
)  
dumb  
as  
a  
post  
about  
everything  
But  
horses  
..  

He  >>ARG0
was*  
In  
his  
30s  <ARG2
divorced  
and  
Had*  
2  
kids  <ARG1
..  
but  
we  >ARG0
both  
flirted*  
Horribly  <ARGM-ADV
with  
each  
other  <ARG1
..  
but  
neither  
one  >>ARG0
of  
us  
took*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
chance*  
and  
Asked*  
to  
other  <ARG2
on  
a  
date  <ARG1
.  
:(  

sort  
a  >ARGM-ADV
wonder*  
what  >>ARG2
it  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
like  <C-ARG2
?  

But  >ARGM-DIS
That  >ARG1
was*  
Years  
ago  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
had*  
this  
Habit  <ARG1
of  
telling*  
you  <ARG2
Everything  <ARG1
..  

Well  
one  
day  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
said*  
to  
me  <ARG2
You  >ARG0
know*  
i  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
wear*  
Underwear  <ARG1
as  
he  >>ARG0
was*  
bent*  
over  <ARGM-DIR
Working*  
on  
my  
Mare  
s  
Right  
front  
hoof  <ARG1
..  
and  
I  >ARG1
was*  
Like  <ARGM-DIS
Ummmm  <ARG2
okay  
???  

I  >>ARG1
m*  
glad*  
his  
butt  >>ARG0
was*  
facing*  
me  <ARG1
so  
he  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see*  
my  
red  
face  <ARG1
I  >ARG0
think*  
my  
Mare  >>ARG0
was*  
even  >ARGM-ADV
laughing*  
..  

Well  
6  
weeks  
Later  >>ARGM-TMP
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG1
came*  >>ARGM-TMP
back  
out  <ARGM-DIR
He  >>ARG0
was*  
again  >ARGM-TMP
working*  
on  
my  
mare  
s  
front  
Foot  <ARG1
and  
I  >ARG0
looked*  
Down  <ARGM-DIR
and  
Yeah  >ARGM-DIS
he  >ARG0
had*  
Wholes  <ARG1
In  
his  
pants  
In  
the  
wrong  
places  
I  >>ARG0
bust*  
out  
Laughing*  
and  
He  >ARG1
was*  
like  <ARGM-DIS
what  <ARG2
???  

I  >ARG1
was*  
like  <ARGM-DIS
Ummmm  >ARGM-DIS
i  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see*  
your  
ass  
cheeks  <ARG1
...  
he  >ARG1
was*  
like  <ARGM-DIS
Oops  >>ARGM-DIS
did*  
i  >ARG0
forget*  
my  
Underwear  <ARG1
???  

that  >ARG1
was*  
a  
strange  >ARGM-MNR
way*  >ARGM-MNR
to  
flirt*  
..  
but  
i  >ARG0
guss*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
his  >ARG0
way*  
...  

But  
like  
i  >ARG0
said*  >ARGM-ADV
nothing  >ARG1
ever  >ARGM-TMP
came*  
of  
It  <ARG2
..  
the  
next  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
saw*  
him  <ARG1
He  >>ARG0
had*  
told*  
Me  <ARG2
he  
had*  
To  
get*  
married*  
to  
a  
girl  >ARG3
Who  >R-ARG3
he  >ARG0
worked*  
with  <C-ARG3
becuse  
he  >ARG0
knocked*  
Her  <ARG1
Up  <C-V
..  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
heartbroken  <ARG2
..  
but  
then  >ARGM-TMP
realized*  
He  >ARG1
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
Guy  <ARG2
for  
me  
..  

Wow  
he  >>ARG1
does*  
sound*  
interested*  
in  
you  <ARG2
,  
my  
farrier  >>ARG0
never  >>ARGM-NEG
gives*  >ARGM-LVB
me  >ARG1
hugs*  
like  
that  <ARGM-MNR
(  
probably  
a  
good  
thing  
as  
he  >ARG0
has*  
a  
wife  <ARG1
and  
2  
kids  
)  
anyway  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
find*  
that  
they  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
busy*  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
wait*  
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
lo9nger  
and  
if  
still  
no  >ARGM-NEG
reply*  >>ARGM-ADV
give*  >ARGM-LVB
him  >ARG1
a  
call*  
but  
do*  
n’t  >ARGM-NEG
leave*  
a  
message  <ARG1
so  
you  >>ARG1
do*  
n’t  
have*  
to  
necessarily  >ARGM-ADV
wait*  
for  
him  >ARG0
to  
call*  
.  

From  
the  
point  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
view*  
of  
a  
business  <ARG0
,  
and  
client  >ARG0
/  
operator  
relationships*  
,  
he  >>ARG0
's*  
doing*  
a  
really  
shitty  
job  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Leaving*  
nails  <ARG1
out  <C-V
so  
you  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
call*  
and  
have*  
him  >ARG1
come*  
back  
out  <ARGM-DIR
later  <ARGM-TMP
?  

Cute*  >ARGM-ADV
or  
not  
,  
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
call*  
a  
different  
bloke  <ARG1
because  
he  >>ARG0
's*  
doing*  
a  
sub-par  
job  <ARGM-MNR
at  
something  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
needs*  
to  
be*  
doing*  
his  
best  <ARGM-MNR
at  <C-ARG1
,  
whether  
he  >>ARG0
's*  
flirting*  
or  
trying*  
to  
ask*  
you  <ARG1
out  <C-V
or  
not  
,  
he  >ARG0
ought  
to  
put*  
quality  <ARG1
first  <ARG2
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
,  
after  
all  <ARGM-ADV
,  
his  
business  <ARG2
,  
and  
if  
he  >ARG0
wants*  
you  >ARG1
to  
remain*  
a  
customer  <ARG3
why  >>ARGM-CAU
on  
earth  
is*  
he  >>ARG0
doing*  >ARGM-LVB
shoddy  >ARGM-MNR
work*  
?  

EPM  >ARGM-DIS
,  
Anyone  >ARG0
Dealt*  
with  
it  <ARG2
?  

Might  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
something  <ARG2
different  
?  

I  >ARG0
have*  
the  
opportunity  <ARG1
to  
pick*  
up  
a  
super  
nice  
6  
year  
old  <ARG1
for  
free  <ARG3
.  

He  >>ARG1
's*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
lame*  
,  
but  
he  >>ARG1
's*  
been*  
having*  >ARGM-LVB
issues*  
.  

Here  >ARG2
's*  
what  >>ARG1
the  
owner  >>ARG0
has*  
said*  
:  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
5  
year  
old  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
lost*  
all  <ARG1
of  
his  
cheek  
muscle  
on  
the  
right  
side  
about  
3  
-  
4  
months  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
chalked*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
to  
possible  >ARGM-ADJ
nerve  >ARG1
damage*  
,  
because  
this  >ARG1
is*  
what  >ARG1
the  
vet  >ARG0
thought*  
and  
the  
other  
cheek  
muscle  >>ARG1
was*  
fine*  
and  
he  >ARG0
had*  
no  
theeth  
problems  <ARG1
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
sent*  
him  <ARG1
to  
the  
trainers  <ARGM-DIR
the  
first  <ARGM-TMP
of  
September  
to  
be*  
started*  
on  
the  
barrels  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
got*  
him  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-ADV
the  
first  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
month  
and  
he  >>ARG1
had*  
lost*  
some  
weight  <ARG1
but  
attributed*  
that  <ARG1
to  
be*  
worked*  
everyday  <ARGM-TMP
(  
I  >ARG0
expected*  
him  >ARG0
to  
drop*  
some  <ARG1
)  
.  

He  >>ARG0
is*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
losing*  
the  
cheek  
muscle  <ARG1
on  
the  
left  
side  <ARGM-LOC
of  
his  
face  
and  
seems*  
to  
be*  
dropping*  
weight  <ARG1
by  
the  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Had*  
him  <ARG1
to  
a  
dentist  <ARG1
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
and  
there  
is*  
no  
teeth  
problems  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
eat*  
all  
his  
feed  <ARG1
and  
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
drop*  
any  <ARG1
,  
but  
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
eat*  
hay  <ARG1
from  
lack*  
of  
muscle  >ARGM-MNR
to  
chew*  
it  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
is*  
gant  
looking  <ARG2
in  
his  
flank  
area  <ARGM-LOC
and  
is*  
losing*  
topline  
muscle  <ARG1
.  

The  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
neurological  >ARGM-MNR
sign*  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
he  >ARG0
shows*  
is*  
that  
he  >>ARG0
barely  >ARGM-ADV
drags*  
his  
toes  <ARG1
and  
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
has*  
trouble  <ARG1
with  
his  
right  
lead  
.  

The  
horse  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
had*  
posted*  
about  <C-ARG1
a  
couple  
weeks  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
with  
the  
atrophied*  
cheek  
muscles  <ARG1
is*  
down  
to  
his  >ARG0
last  >ARGM-TMP
resort*  
for  
life  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
CAN  >ARGM-MOD
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
afford*  
to  
treat*  
whatever  >>ARG1
is*  
wrong*  
with  
him  <ARG2
.  

NO  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
not  
done*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
EPM  >ARG2
test*  
but  
have*  
done*  
an  
extensive  
blood  
panel  <ARG1
and  
my  
vet  >ARG0
did*  
a  
neurological  
physical  
exam  <ARG1
.  

We  >>ARG0
elected*  
to  
not  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
the  
EPM  >ARG2
test*  
because  
there  
was*  
NO  >ARGM-NEG
neurological  >ARGM-MNR
signs*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
is*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
showing*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
signs*  
other  <ARGM-ADJ
than  
the  
weight  >ARG1
loss*  
,  
and  
some  
muscle  
atrophy  
.  

He  >ARG0
eats*  
all  <ARG1
of  
his  
grain  
but  
it  
just  >ARGM-ADV
takes*  
him  <ARG2
a  
while  <ARG1
to  
get*  
it  >ARG1
chewed*  
because  
of  
the  
lack*  
of  
muscle  <ARG1
in  
his  
jaws  
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
get*  
the  
horse  <ARG1
and  
see*  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
getting*  
with  
my  
vet  <ARG1
first  <ARGM-TMP
and  
if  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
get*  >ARGM-ADV
him  <ARG1
,  
have*  
the  
spinal  
fluid  >ARG1
test*  >ARGM-PRR
done*  
for  
EPM  <<ARG2
and  
a  
titer  >ARG1
test*  
.  

Will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
getting*  
a  
copy*  
of  
the  
blood  
results  >>ARG1
the  
owner  >>ARG0
has*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
ran*  
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

My  
other  
theory  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
wobblers  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
having*  
my  
equine  
chiro  
/  
acupuncturist  <ARG1
out  
to  
do*  >ARGM-LVB
some  >ARGM-EXT
work*  
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
if  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
get*  
him  <ARG1
....  

So  
any  
ideas  
?  

Think*  
I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
it  <ARG1
?  

Arby  
,  

Horse  >>ARG1
is*  
out  
of  
state  <ARG2
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
local*  
.  

Owner  >>ARG0
is*  
willing*  
to  
meet*  
me  <ARG1
half  
way  <ARGM-EXT
with  
him  <ARGM-COM
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
calling*  
my  
vet  <ARG1
and  
chiro  
about  
him  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Worse  >ARG1
comes*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
worse  <ARG2
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
out  
of  
the  
$  
$  <ARG2
and  
have*  
to  
put*  
him  <ARG1
down  <ARG2
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
or  
have*  
a  
pretty  
pasture  
ornament  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
's*  
still  <ARGM-TMP
rideable  <ARG2
currently  <ARGM-TMP
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
having*  
many  >ARGM-ADJ
issues*  
under  
saddle  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
a  
horse  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
otherwise  >>ARGM-ADV
would  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
able*  
to  
afford*  
and  
even  
if  
I  >ARG0
spend*  >>ARGM-ADV
2  
K  <ARG3
and  
treatment*  
I  >ARG1
come*  
out  
ahead  
of  
his  >ARG1
purchase  >ARG1
price*  
.  

I  >ARG0
posted*  
what  >>ARG1
the  
owner  >>ARG0
as*  
said*  
in  
paragraph  <ARGM-LOC
2  
&  
3  
,  
that  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
me  <ARG2
to  
clarify*  
.  

She  >ARG1
is*  
the  
one  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
afford*  
to  
do*  
anything  <ARG1
else  
for  
him  <ARG2
in  
case  
he  >>ARG1
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
recover*  
fully  <ARGM-EXT
.  

He  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
eat*  
grain  <ARG1
and  
I  >ARG0
already  >ARGM-TMP
have*  
a  
feed  
regimen  <ARG1
in  
my  
head  <ARGM-LOC
for  
the  
guy  <ARGM-GOL
since  
he  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
eat*  
regular  
hay  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
it  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
hard*  
to  
keep*  
his  
weight  <ARG1
up  <ARG2
so  
long  <<ARGM-ADV
as  
he  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
eat*  
the  
grain  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
not  
going*  
to  
go*  
pick*  
up  
a  
horse  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
afford*

I  >>ARG0
am*  
willing*  
to  
pull*  
the  
EPM  >ARG2
test*  
and  
treat*  
.  

The  
owner  >ARG1
is*  
the  
one  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG1
is*  
unable*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD

my  
other  
vet  >ARG1
up  <ARG1
who  >R-ARG1

a  
chiro  <ARG2
&  
acupuncturist  
to  
evaluate*  
him  <ARG1
for  
wobblers  <ARG2
.  

July  >>ARG0
is*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >C-ARG1
started*  
to  
exhibit*  
slight  
symptoms  <ARG1
and  
the  
owner  >ARG0
and  
vet  
originally  >ARGM-TMP
thought*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
just  >ARGM-ADJ
some  
nerve  >ARG1
damage*  
from  
something  <ARG0
in  
the  
pasture  
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
visible  >ARGM-ADJ
injury*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
's*  
only  >ARGM-ADV
exhibited*  
weight  >ARG1
loss*  
and  
some  
muscle  
atrophy  
,  
with  
the  
slight  >ARGM-ADJ
toe  >ARG1
drag*  
and  
a  
bit  >>ARG1
of  
trouble  
with  
the  
right  
lead  
(  
which  >>R-ARG1

or

The

The

He  >>ARG0
's*

but  
most  >>ARG1

that  
came*  
from  
being*  
at  
the  
trainer  <ARG2
s  
and  
being*  
ridden*  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
for  
60  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >>ARG0
's*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
putting*  
it  <ARG1
back  
on  <ARG2

I  >ARG0
know*

the

treating*  
him  <ARG1

put*  
him  <ARG1
down  <ARG2

At  
the  
same  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
do*  
know*  
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
have*  
had*  
horses  >ARG1

back  <ARGM-DIR
successfully  <ARGM-MNR
after  
EPM  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
this  >>ARG1
is*  
going*  
to  
be*  
expensive*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
willing*  
to  
give*  >ARGM-LVB
it  >ARG2
a  
shot*  
.  

Gallop  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
've*  
already  >>ARGM-TMP
read*  
that  
whole  
site  <ARG1
and  
been*  
reading*  
through  
research  
articles  <ARG1
from  
the  
research  
colleges  
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

Looked*  
at  
studies*  
,  
treatment  
options  
and  
such  
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
the  
EPM  >ARG2
test*  >ARGM-PRR
done*  
before  
treating*  
.  

The  
chiro  
/  
acupuncturist  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
there  <ARG2
to  
evaluate*  
the  
horse  <ARG1
for  
wobblers  >>ARG2
which  >>R-ARG2
is*  
often  >ARGM-TMP
caused*  
by  
spinal  >ARG1
compression*  
and  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
confused*  
with  
EPM  <ARG3

If  
that  >ARG1
is*  
the  
case  <ARG2
then  
acupuncture  >>ARG0

n't

It  >ARG1
's*  
actually  <ARGM-ADV
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
alternative  
therapies  
for  
EPM  

I  >ARG0
think*  
it  
is*  
wonderfully  >ARGM-ADV
responsible*  
that  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
going*  
into  
this

eyes  >ARG1

are*  
getting*  
the  
opinions  <ARG1
of  
qualified  
professionals  
(  
and  
a  
bunch  
of  
Yahoos  
)  
before  
you  >>ARG0
decide*  
to  
take*  
this  
horse  <ARG1
on  <C-V
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
think*  
some  
Y!A  
users  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
work*  
on  
their  >ARG0
reading  >ARG1
comprehension*  
as  
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
comprehend*  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
taking*  >>ARG1
a  
horse  <ARG1
in  <C-V
as  
a  
rescue*  
and  
getting*  
it  <ARG4
qualified  >ARGM-ADJ
medical  >ARGM-ADJ
treatment*  
is*  
abuse*  
.  

Worst  
case  
scenario  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG1
fall*  
in  
love*  
and  
after  
spending*  
thousands  <ARG3
of  
dollars  
you  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
put*  
the  
horse  <ARG1
down  <ARG2
.  

Is*  
that  <ARG1
something  <ARG2
you  >ARG1
are*  
up  <ARG2
for  
?  

If  
so  >ARGM-ADV
go*  
for  
it  <ARG1
and  
I  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
give*  >ARGM-LVB
you  >ARG1
all  
the  
moral  >ARGM-ADJ
support*  
I  
can  <ARGM-ADJ
as  
you  >ARG0
figure*  
out  
what  >ARG1
is*  
up  <ARG2
.  

It  
is*  
heartbreaking  <ARG2
to  
try*  
to  
bring*  
a  
horse  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
and  
then  
have*  
to  
put*  
it  <ARG1
down  <ARG2
,  
but  
some  
horses  >>ARG1
are*  
worth*  
the  
risk*  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
feel*  >>ARGM-ADV
this  
guy  >>ARG1
is*  
worth*  
it  <ARG2
then  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
hope*  
your  
vet  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
figure*  
things  <ARG1
out  <C-V
.  

As  
to  
EPM  
like  
Shee  >>ARG1
said*  
being*  
in  
MI  <ARG2
we  >>ARG0
've*  
had*  
to  
deal*  
with  
it  <ARG2
.  

Pretty  
much  
every  
large  
stable  
has*  
here  
.  

Our  
first  
diagnosed  
EPM  
horse  >ARG1
was*  
back  
when  >ARGM-TMP
there  
was*  
no  
treatment*  
in  
the  
US  <ARGM-LOC
and  
only  
an  
experimental  
chicken  
feed  
additive  
in  
Canada  
.  

We  >>ARG0
hauled*  
the  
horse  <ARG1
to  
Windsor  <ARGM-DIR
and  
got*  
him  >ARG1
treated*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

That  
horse  >ARG1
returned*  
to  
racing*  
and  
we  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
notice*  
much  >ARGM-EXT
difference*  
.  

We  >>ARG0
've*  
had*  
a  
few  <ARG1
since  
then  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
none  
since  
our  
race  
horses  >>ARG0
began*  
wintering*  
in  
Florida  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
no  
idea  <ARG1
if  
that  >>ARG1
is*  
related*  
or  
farmers  >>ARG0
are*  
doing*  
a  
better  
job  <ARG1
of  
clearing*  
out  
opossums  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
because  
they  >ARG0
know*  
opossums  >ARG1
are*  
carriers  <ARG2
,  
but  
we  >>ARG0
have*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
had*  
an  
EPM  
horse  <ARG1
in  
at  
least  
10  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
all  >>ARG1
of  
our  
EPM  
horses  
were*  
treated*  
early  <ARGM-TMP
when  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
were*  
showing*  
mild  >ARGM-EXT
signs*  
like  
Shee  >ARG0
gave*  
and  
all  >C-ARG1
returned*  
to  
racing*  
.  

One  
horse  >>ARG1
even  >ARGM-ADV
got*  
his  >ARG0
lifetime  >ARG1
mark*  
after  
being*  
treated*  
for  
EPM  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG0
've*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
liked*  
big  
long  
trotters  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
do*  
better  <ARGM-MNR
on  
mile  
tracks  <ARGM-LOC
then  
1  
/  
2  
mile  <ARGM-ADV
.  

The  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
difference*  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
noticed*  
is*  
that  
the  
EPM  
horses  >>ARG0
seemed*  
to  
do*  
worse  <ARGM-MNR
on  
the  
smaller  
tracks  <ARGM-LOC
after  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
coincidence  <ARG2
or  
the  
fact  
those  
great  
big  
trotters  >ARG0
with  
those  
extremely  
long  
backs  
lost*  
a  
bit  <ARG1
of  
fine  >ARGM-ADJ
coordination*  
to  
get*  
those  
gangly  
bodies  <ARG1
around  
those  
tighter  >ARGM-ADJ
turns*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
.  

MSU  >ARG0
does*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
EPM  >ARG1
studies*  
because  
of  
how  
common  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
is*  
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

You  >>ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
want*  
to  
see*  
if  
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
get*  
in  
touch*  
with  
their  
EPM  
group  <<ARGM-COM
and  
get*  
this  
guy  <ARG1
in  
a  
study*  
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
they  >ARG0
did*  
lab  >ARG0
work*  >ARG0
showing*  
that  
Strongid  
C  >>ARG0
used*  
daily  <ARGM-TMP
could  >ARGM-MOD
help*  
prevent*  
EPM  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
believe*  
they  >ARG0
have*  
a  
real  >ARGM-ADJ
study*  >ARG0
testing*  
the  
lab  >ARG0
work*  
in  
real  
world  
situations  <<ARGM-LOC
now  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
some  
time  <ARG2
before  
those  
results  >>ARG1
are*  
released*  
.  

Another  
thought*  
with  
this  >ARG1
being*  
a  
mosquito  
season  >ARGM-ADV
from  
hell  
could  >ARGM-MOD
it  >ARG1
be*  
West  
Nile  <ARG2
?  

West  
Nile  >>ARG2
can  >ARGM-MOD
cause*  
EPM  
like  
symptoms  <ARG1
and  
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
always  >ARGM-TMP
include*  
a  
fever  <ARG1
.  

Let*  
us  >ARG0
know*  
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
decide*  
to  
do*  
.  

You  >>ARG0
hate*  
to  
see*  
talent  >>ARG1
get*  
wasted*  
,  
but  
honestly  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
in  
a  
horse  <ARG1
right  
now  <ARGM-TMP
these  
issues*  
.  

Personally  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
think*  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
keep*  
on  
walking*  
by  <ARGM-DIR
.  

You  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
you  
chiro  <ARG1
out  <ARG1
before  
you  >ARG0
decide*  
if  
you  >ARG0
want*  
this  
horse  <ARG1
or  
not  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
have*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
good  
repoire  <ARG1
(  
which  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
sure*  
you  
do*  
)  
with  
them  
,  
they  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
honest*  
on  
if  
this  
horse  >ARG1
is*  
fixable  <ARG2
to  
any  
degree  <ARGM-EXT
...  
not  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-ADV
sure*  
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
do*  
with  
him  <ARG2
...  

Even  
if  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
figure*  >>ARGM-ADV
out  
what  >>ARG1
is*  
wrong*  
with  
this  
poor  
poneh  <ARG2
,  
there  
is*  
always  <ARGM-TMP
the  
chance*  
for  
remission*  
and  
then  
relapse  
so  
you  
may  
have*  
to  
do*  
deal*  
with  <ARG2
again  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
future  <ARGM-TMP
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
all  >ARGM-ADV
in  
all  
,  
put*  
the  
money  <ARG1
up  
front  <ARG2
before  
taking*  
on*  
this  
horse  <ARG1
.  

A  
few  
hundred  >ARG3
out  
of  
pocket  
now  
will  >ARGM-MOD
possibly  >ARGM-ADV
save*  
you  <ARG2
thousands  <ARG1
once  
the  
horse  >ARG1
is*  
in  
your  
name  <ARG2
.  

Could  >>ARGM-MOD
he  >>ARGM-GOL
have*  
had*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
blow*  >ARG0
to  
the  
head  <ARG1
causing*  
this  
atrophy  <ARG1
?  

Or  
a  
difficult  >ARGM-MNR
birth*  
?  

Was  
it  
always  
like  
this  
?  

Or  
has*  
it  >ARG1
occurred*  
since  
birth*  
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
wonder*  
if  
he  
might  
have*  
had*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
slight  >ARGM-EXT
stroke*  
?  

I  >ARG0
think*  
if  
you  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
afford*  
to  
get*  
him  >ARG1
treated*  
that  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
consider*  
him  <ARG1
as  
a  
prospect*  
.  

Who  >ARG0
knows*  
what  >ARG1
the  
future  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
hold*  
,  
and  
it  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
expensive*  
?  

Extremely  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
customer  >ARG2
service*  

Do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
to  
this  
salon  <ARG4
,  
especially  
if  
you  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
get*  
your  
hair  >ARG1
straightened*  
.  

They  >>ARG0
did*  
a  
very  
bad  
job  <ARG1
with  
my  
hair  <ARG2
and  
were*  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
rude*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
went*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
to  
ask*  
them  <ARG2
why  >>ARGM-CAU
it  >>ARG1
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
work*  
for  
my  
hair  <ARG2
.  

Rude  
,  
insensitive  
,  
discourteous  
people  
!!!!!  

Great  
Doc  

Dr  >>ARG0
Greenwalt  
fixed*  
my  
neck  <ARG1
from  
a  
snowboard  >ARG2
injury*  
and  
was*  
way  >ARGM-EXT
more  >ARGM-CXN
effective*  
that  
a  
regular  
doctor  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

He  >>ARG0
did*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
prescribe*  
pain  
meds  <ARG1
or  
other  
drugs  
,  
he  >ARG0
used*  
his  
bodytalk  
method  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
unusual*  
but  
the  
results  >ARG1
are*  
undeniable  <ARG2
.  

My  
neck  >>ARG1
is*  
fixed*  
!.  

He  >ARG0
knows*  
what  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
s*  
doing*  
.  

Our  >ARG1
Wedding*  
11/7/08  <ARGM-TMP

We  >>ARG1
just  >>ARGM-TMP
had*  >ARGM-LVB
our  >ARG2
wedding*  
on  
11/7/08  <ARGM-TMP
and  
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
impressed*  
.  

Cj  >ARG0
and  
company  
did*  
all  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
we  >ARG0
ask*  
and  
10  
times  
more  
.  

The  
food  >ARG1
was*  
out  
standing  <ARG2
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
need*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
cater  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is*  
affordable*  
and  
easy*  
to  
work*  
with  <ARG3
they  >ARG1
are*  
the  
ones  <ARG2
.

Excellent  
Tattoo  
Shop  

I  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
got*  
a  
tattoo  >ARG1
done*  
at  
Aztec  <ARGM-LOC
and  
I  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
happier*  
.  

It  >>ARG1
came*  
out  
better*  
than  
I  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
imagined*  
.  

The  
shop  >>ARG1
was*  
great*  
,  
the  
service*  >>ARG1
was*  
excellent*  
and  
the  
employees  >ARG1
were*  
fun  
guys  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0

shop  <ARG1
to  
anyone  >ARG0
looking*  
to  
get*  
a  
quality  
tattoo  >ARG1

.  

Good  
and  
Bad  

I  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
the  
ants  <ARG1
myself  <ARGM-REC
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
found*  
the  
location  >ARG1
wonderful*  
and  
the  
neighbors  >ARG0
very  >ARGM-EXT
kind*  
.  

Never  >ARGM-NEG
had*  
a  
problem  <ARG1
with  
the  
staff  
and  
found*  
them  >ARG0
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
something  >>ARG2
went*  
wrong*  
.  

Loved*  
the  
pool  <ARG1
and  
BBQ  
.  

Because  
of  
the  
ants  >ARGM-CAU
I  >ARG0
dropped*  
them  <ARG1
to  
a  
3

Great  >ARGM-ADJ

how  
much  >ARGM-EXT

I  >>ARG0

This

with  
a  
great

cool

the

scrumptious  <ARG2
(  
and  
especially  
their

Sure  >ARGM-DIS

some

a

Best  
Chineese  
food  
in  
the  
area  

The  
food  >>ARG1
here  
is*  
fresh*  
and  
hot*  
out  
of  
the  
Wok  <ARGM-DIR
.  

The  
food  >>ARG1
is*  
cooked*  
fast  <ARGM-MNR
by  
the  
two  
chefs  <ARG0
on  
duty  
.  

The  
lunch  
specials  >ARG1
are*  
more  
food  <ARG2
than  
most  
people  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
eat*  
for  
about  
$  <<ARGM-ADV
6  
.  

It  >>ARG1
is*  
busy*  
every  
day  <ARGM-TMP
at  
lunch  
for  
a  
reason  <ARGM-CAU
,  
the  
service*  >>ARG1
is*  
fast*  
and  
the  
food  >>ARG1
is*  
great*

Pure  
Pilates  
!!  

It  >ARG1
is*  
the  
real  
thing  <ARG2
-  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
practicing*  
Pilates  <ARG1
for  
over  
7  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
anywhere  <ARG4
else  
.  

It  
is*  
the  
attention*  >>ARG0
to  
detail  <ARG1
and  
the  
quality  
of  
the  
work*  >ARG1
taught*  
at  
TomiPilates  <ARGM-LOC
that  >R-ARG0
sets*  
this  
studio  <ARG1
apart  
from  
the  
others  
.  

The  
teachers  >>ARG1
are*  
highly  
trained  <ARG2
and  
are*  
expert*  
at  
handling*  
all  
types  <ARG1
of  
clients  
.  

I  >ARG0
phoned*  
this  
company  <ARG1
for  
advice  <ARGM-PRP
on  
our  
office  
refurb  
and  
although  
we  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
use*  >>ARGM-ADV
them  <ARG1
in  
the  
end*  
(  
as  
our  
building  
contractor  >ARG0
carried*  
out  
the  
electrical  >ARG1
work*  
)  
,  
they  >ARG0
provided*  
me  <ARG2
with  
plenty  <ARG1
of  
useful  
information  
over  
an  
hour  >ARGM-TMP
phone  >ARGM-MNR
call*  
and  
subsequently  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG0
are*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
using*  
PJC  <ARG1
as  
our  
electrical  >ARG1
maintenance*  
contractor  <<ARG2
.  

Thoroughly  
recommended  

They  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
go*  
above  <ARG2
and  
beyond  
!  

For  
example  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
forgot*  
to  
feed*  
my  
cat  <ARG2
,  
and  
they  >>ARG0
went*  
out  
of  
their  >ARG0
way*  
to  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
him  <ARG1
.  

Additionally  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
there  
was*  >>ARGM-TMP
confusion*  
(  
my  >ARG1
fault*  
)  
,  
they  >ARG0
left*  
me  <ARG2
flowers  <ARG1
along  
with  
a  
personalized*  
gift  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
100  
%  >ARGM-EXT
reliable*  
and  
professional  
.  

Definitely  >ARGM-ADV
recommend*

The

Like

Extensive

wish*  
they  >ARG0
had*  
a  
bit  
more  <ARG1
on  
their  
food  
menu  <ARGM-LOC
,  
although  
popcorn  >ARG1
is*  
a  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ

!  

(

:  
chicken  
fingers  
,  
wings  
,  
asian  
pizza  
,  
and

and  
regular

Their  
food  >>ARG0
and  
sweets  
are*  
awesome*  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
service*  >>ARG2
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
poor*  
.  

Attitude  
of  
staff  
very  
bad  
.  

Never  >ARGM-NEG
gives*  
a  
receipt  <ARG1

Sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
even  >ARGM-ADV
gives*  
wrong  
dish  <ARG1
.  

So  
confused  
at  
the  
payment  
area  
.  

Line  
up  >>ARG1

so  >ARGM-EXT
stupid*

so  >>ARGM-ADV
what  >>ARG2
they  >ARG0

might  >>ARGM-MOD
never  >>ARGM-NEG

First  
Time  
Ballerina  

My  
daughter  >>ARG0
is*  
starting*  
ballet*  
this  
year  <<ARGM-TMP
for  
the  
first  
time  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG1
'm*  
a  
soccer  
mom  <ARG2
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
was*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
sure*  
what  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
was*  
looking*  
for  <C-ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
it  
comes*  
to  
dancewear  <ARG1
.  

The  
staff  >>ARG0
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful*  
and  
gave*  
me  <ARG1
exactly  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
needed*  
for  
my  
first  
time  
ballerina  <ARGM-PRP
.  

The  
service*  >>ARG1
at  
Instep  <ARGM-LOC
was*  
great*  
!!  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
them  <ARG1
to  
anyone  <ARG2
!  

Outstanding  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
&  
quality  
at  
a  
very  
affordable  >ARGM-ADJ
price*  
!  

This  
place  >>ARG1
is*  
top  
notch  <ARG2
and  
highly  >ARGM-EXT
affordable*  
!  

I  >>ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
it  <ARG1
hands  <ARGM-ADV
down  
and  
am*  
a  
loyal  
customer  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
sent*  
over  <ARGM-DIR
a  
number  >ARG0
of  
friends  
to  
use*  
the  
services*  
here  <ARGM-LOC
and  
everyone  >>ARG1
is*  
extraordinarily  >ARGM-ADV
pleased*  
!  

Thanks*  
for  
doing*  >ARGM-LVB
such  >ARGM-ADJ
great  >ARGM-ADJ
work*  
on  
my  
important  
pieces  >>ARG1
of  
clothing  
that  >>R-ARG1
always  >>ARGM-TMP
look*  
great*  
!  

Tried*  
Crust  <ARG1
on  
Broad  
on  
3  
occasions*  
.  

Twice  
for  
dinner  
and  
once  
for  
lunch  
Absolutely  
rude  >ARGM-MNR
service*  
every  
time  
!  

The  
staff  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
answer*  
the  
phone  <ARG1
for  
take  
out  
.  

Tonight  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
called*  
several  
times  <ARGM-TMP
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
answer*  
(  
Btwn  
5:30  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
6  
pm  
)  
and  
finally  >ARGM-TMP
drove*  
there  <ARGM-GOL
to  
place*  
my  >ARG0
order*  
in  
person  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

There  
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
customer  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
found*  
.  

we  >>ARG0
purchased*  
a  
new  
home  <ARG1
but  
was*  
unable*  
to  
sell*  
our  
old  
house  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
contacted*  
this  
property  >ARG1
management*  
company  <<ARG1
and  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
helped*  
us  >>ARG0
quickly  >ARGM-MNR
rent*  
out  
our  
house  <ARG1
and  
keep*  
it  >ARG1
maintained*  
.  

Since  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG0
have*  
decided*  
to  
have*  
them  >ARG0
manage*  
our  
other  
investment  
properties  <ARG1
as  <ARGM-DIS
well  
as  
we  >>ARG0
getting*  
older*  
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
no  
longer  >ARGM-NEG
perform*  
all  
the  
inquires  <ARG1
.  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
help*  
!  

We  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
got*  
our  
sunroom  >ARG1
built*  
by  
Patio  
World  <ARG0
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
that  
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
happy*  
with  
the  
whole  
thing  <ARG0
.  

From  
the  
amount  >ARG1
of  
time  
spent*  
with  
us  <ARGM-COM
to  
explain*  
things  <ARG1
during  
the  
initial  >ARGM-TMP
quote*  
,  
to  
the  
communication*  
through  
the  
approval  >ARG1
process*  
to  
the  
actual  
workmanship  
of  
the  
build*  
itself  <ARGM-REC
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
nothing  >ARG1
bad  
to  
say*  
.  

Very  
glad  
that  
we  >ARG0
went*  
with  
them  <ARGM-COM
.  

No  >ARGM-NEG
Customer  >ARG2
Service*  

Employees  >>ARG0
seemed*  
to  
be*  
having*  
a  
good  
time  <ARG1
chatting*  
and  
laughing*  
with  
each  
other  <ARGM-COM
,  
while  
myself  >>ARG1
and  
other  
customers  
were*  
completely  >ARGM-EXT
ignored*  
.  

Another  
person  >>ARG0
in  
the  
store  
stood*  
there  <ARG2
with  
an  
item  <ARGM-ADV
and  
repeatedly  >ARGM-ADV
tried*  
to  
get*  
a  
sales  
person  >ARG0
s  
attention*  
.  

It  
was*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
until  
he  >>ARG0
gave*  
up  
and  
walked*  
out  
the  
door  <ARG2
that  >ARGM-ADV
someone  >ARG0
asked*  
Can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
help*  
you  <ARG2
.  

do*  
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
bring*  
your  
car  <ARG1
here  <ARG2

I  >ARG0
got*  
a  
coupon  <ARG1
from  
Pennysaver  <ARG2
for  
this  
station  <C-ARG1
.  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
they  >ARG0
accepted*  
it  <ARG1
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
during  
the  
test*  >ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >ARG0
did*  
whatever  <ARG1
they  
can  
to  
get*  
my  >ARG1
test*  >ARG2
failed*  
.  

Then  >ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >ARG0
sold*  
me  <ARG2
overpriced  
stuffs  <ARG1
,  
such  
as  
oil  
tank  
cap  
,  
so  
that  
my  
car  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
pass*  
it  <ARG2
right  
away  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
ended*  
up  
paying*  
much  
more  <ARG1
.  

Are*  
you  >ARG0
kidding*  
me  <ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
it  <ARG1
.  

Spongy  
and  
sweet  
bread  >ARG1
(  
microwaved*  
?  
)  
,  
heartless  
salsa  
,  
tiny  
dogs  
...  

You  >ARG0
order*  
at  
the  
counter  <ARGM-LOC
and  
there  
is*  
a  
space  <ARG1
for  
tip*  
on  
your  
credit  
card  
receipt  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
dude  >>ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
grills*  
the  
retarded  
dogs  <ARG1
is*  
rude*  
.  

If  
this  >ARG1
is*  
the  
best  >>ARGM-ADV
that  >>ARG1
Tucson  >ARG0
has*  
to  
offer*  
,  
I  >ARG1
am*  
out  
ta  
here  <ARG2
...  

I  >>ARG0
called*  
on  
a  
Friday  <ARGM-TMP
at  
12:30  <ARGM-TMP
complaining*  
of  
a  
severe  
toothache  <ARG1
.  

Dr.  >ARG0
Obina  
told*  
me  <ARG2
that  
his  
office  >ARG1
closed*  
at  
noon  <ARGM-TMP
and  
that  
I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
call*  
him  <ARG1
on  
Monday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
had*  
been*  
a  
patient  <ARG2
of  
Dr.  
Olbina  
for  
9  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
had*  
spent*  
thousands  <ARG3
of  
dollars  
on  
crowns  <ARG3
etc  
.  

There  
are*  
plenty  <ARG1
of  
good  
dentists  
in  
Fernandina  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
to  
Amelia  
Gentle  
Dentistry  <ARG4
.  

Good  
location  

For  
a  
hotel  >ARGM-CAU
like  
this  
you  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
expect*  
some  
form  <ARG1
of  
free  
internet  
.  

What  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
get*  
is*  
a  
$  >ARG1
13  
/  
day  
charge*  >ARGM-ADV
to  
access*  
the  
internet  <ARG1
through  
a  
slow  
512  
/  
512  
kb  >ARG1
/  
s  
that  >R-ARG1
you  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
use*  
to  
check*  
email*  
etc  
(  
Read*  
:  
No  >ARGM-NEG
downloading*  
)  
.  

Other  >ARGM-ADV
than  
that  
the  
hotel  >ARG1
is*  
in  
a  
good  
location  <ARG2
and  
the  
breakfast  >>ARG1
is*  
great*  

Make*  
You  >ARG0
Feel*  
Like  
a  
Number  <ARG1

Stay*  
away  <ARG3
from  
Kids  
First  
West

.  

You  >ARG0
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
a  
human  <ARG1
on  
the  
phone  <ARGM-MNR
.  

It  
's*  
impossible*  
to  
get*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
appointment*  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG1
get*  
caught*  >>ARGM-ADV
in  
traffic  <ARG2
and  
are*  
a  
couple  
minutes  >ARGM-TMP
late*  
they  >ARG0
make*  
you  >ARG0
re-schedule*  
...  
for  
6  
weeks  <ARG3
later  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
worst  >ARGM-ADV
of  
all  
your  
child  >ARG0
feels*  
like  
a  
number  <ARG1
not  
a  
patient  
.  

Go*  
somewhere  <ARG4

November

,  
2010  
First  
time  >ARGM-TMP
eating*  
at  
Caffe  
Bella  
Italia  <ARGM-LOC
and  
it  >ARG1
was*  
a  
wonderful  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
.  

From  
the  
delectable  
Antipasto  
Misto  
to  
the  
Spaghetti  
alla  
Barese  
and  
the  
Parmigiana  
and  
ending*  
with  
gelato  <ARG2
,  
all  >ARG1
was*  
mouth  >ARG1
watering*  
.  

Too  
bad  
they  >ARG1
were*  
out  
of  
the  
Chocolate  
Lava

Maybe  >ARGM-ADV

will  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
it  <ARG1
.  

Service*  >>ARG1

attempts*  
I  >>ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
in  
touch*  
with  
the  
manager  <<ARGM-COM
to  
even  >ARGM-ADV
lodge*  
an  
official  >ARGM-ADJ
complaint*  
.  

My  
advise  >ARG1
to  
all  
is*  
I  >>ARG1
have*  
fallen*  
into  
this  
trap  <ARG2

you  
do*  
nt

Course  >>ARG1

HCC  
's  
new  
nine  >ARG1
was*  
a  
little  
shaky  <ARG2
at  
first  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
the  
NEW  
grounds  
superintendant  >>ARG1
has*  
done*  >ARGM-LVB
wonders*  
for  
the  
course  <ARGM-GOL
!!  

The  
comment*  >>ARG1
below  <ARGM-LOC
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
needs*  
to  
be*

!  

Come*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
and  
give*  
HCC  <ARG2
a  
second  >ARGM-TMP
chance*  
at  <<ARGM-ADV
least  
!  

It  >ARG1
is*  
a  
great  
course  >>ARG1
for  
local  
golfers  >>ARG0
to  
be*  
proud*  
of  <C-ARG1

all  
the

Excellent  
Physiotherapists  
!  

Kusal  >>ARG1
Goonewardena  
and  
his  
team  
of  
Physios  
are*  
unbelievable*  
!  

I  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
suffering*  
from  
back  
pain  <ARG1
for  
over  
12  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
have*  
been*  
to  
numerous  
specialists  <ARG2
,  
physios  
,  
osteos  
and  
chiros  
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
help*  
.  

It  
took*  
the  
Vigor  
team  <ARG2
only  
4  >ARGM-ADV
visits*  
to  
get*  
me  >>ARG1
feeling*  
normal*  
!  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
now  >>ARGM-TMP
2  
months  
after  
my  >ARG0
last  >ARGM-TMP
appointment*  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG1

these

My  
husband  >ARG1
and  
I  
happened*  
in  <ARGM-PRD
on  
a  
whim  <ARGM-CAU
.  

We  >ARG1
sat*  
in  
the  
front  
dining  
area  <ARG2
,  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
cozy  <ARG2
and  
pleasant*  
.  

Our  
server  >>ARG0
was*  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
attentive*  
and  
the  
food  >>ARG1
was*  
fantastic*  
.  

My  
husband  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
a  
professional  
chef  <ARG2
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
he  >ARG1
is*  
a  
good  
judge  <ARG2
of  
quality  
food  
.  

This  >ARG1
was*  
a  
flavorful  
,  
enjoyable  
meal  <ARG2
for  
both  
of  
us  
.

an  
uneven

took*  
him  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-PRD
to  
get*  
evened*  
up  <ARGM-PRD
what  
a

!  

she  >>ARG0

nt  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
let*  
me  >ARG0
finish*  
a  
sentence*  
without  
insulting*  
me  <ARG1
and  
telling*  
me  <ARG2
how  >>ARGM-MNR
i  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
said*  
it  <ARG1
!  

i  >ARG0

she  >>ARG0
needs*  
to  
develop*  
a  
personality  <ARG1
!  

brought*  
dog  <ARG1
home  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
s*  
all  
choppy  <ARG2
now  <ARGM-TMP
!  

It  
's*  
helpful*  
to  
know*  
a  
quite  
a  
bit  <ARG1
about  
bull  >ARG1
fighting*  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
watch*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
fights*  
(  
youtube  <<ARGM-MNR
)  
and  
research*  
some  <ARG1
of  
the  
history  
(  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting  <ARGM-MNR
)  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
find*  
yourself  >ARG0
enjoying*  
it  <ARG1
a  
lot  
more  <ARGM-EXT
!  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
after  
seeing*  >ARGM-TMP
a  
handful  <ARG1
of  
bullfights  
,  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
that  
they  >>ARG1
're*  
a  
lot  
more  >ARGM-EXT
enjoyable*  
if  
you  >ARG1
're*  
smashed  <ARG2
(  
BAC  
>=  
.15  
)  
.  

All  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
is*  
that  
I  >>ARG1
am*  
glad*  
I  >ARG0
went*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
!  

The  
nurses  >>ARG1
are*  
sweet*  
as  
pie  <ARGM-EXT
and  
the  
doctor  >>ARG1
is*  
wonderful*  
.  

This  
place  >ARG1
is*  
about  
healing*  
,  
not  
making*  
a  
buck  <ARG1
.  

The  
followup  >ARGM-ADJ
visit*  >>ARG1
is*  
FREE*  
!!  

After  
going*  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
the  
hospital  <ARG4
and  
paying*  
ER  >ARG1
prices*  
...  
there  
is*  
no  
way*  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG1
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
back  
here  <ARG2

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
back  <ARG2
and  
telling*  
EVERYONE  <ARG2
about  
this  
clinic  <ARG1
.  

THANK*  
YOU  <ARG1
!!  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
like*  
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
he  >>ARG0
was*  
able*  
to  
do*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
specific  
type  >>ARG1
of  
repair*  
I  >ARG0
wanted*  
(  
a  
reball  
)  
and  
give*  
me  <ARG2
the  
longest  
warranty  <ARG1
and  
even  >ARGM-ADJ
a  
lower  >ARGM-ADJ
price*  
.  

Someone  >>ARG0
else  
I  >ARG0
found*  
that  >>R-ARG0
said*  
they  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
it  <ARG1
but  
wanted*  
to  
charge*  
me  <ARG2
more  <ARG1
and  
give*  
me  <ARG2
less  
warranty  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
a  
no  
brainer  <ARG2
really  <ARGM-ADV

I  >ARG0

is*  
bad*  
.  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
dark*  
,  
dingy  
&  
dirty*  
.  

The  
salads  >ARG1
are*  
limp  <ARG2
and  
the  
rest  >>ARG1
of  
the  
food  
is*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
any  >ARGM-EXT
better*  
(  
ok  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
nachos  >>ARG1
are*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
too  >ARGM-EXT
bad*

This

RIP  

This  >ARG1
is*  
the  
original  
Ham  
's  
restaurant  >ARG1
,  
expanded*  
into  
a  
regional  
chain  <ARG4
in  
the  
late  
80's  <ARGM-TMP
--  
but  
this  
one  >ARG1
is*  
no  
more  <ARG2
.  

Victim  
of  
hard  
times  
and  
I  >ARG0
suspect*  
failing  >ARGM-PRD
corporate  >ARGM-ADJ
management*  
.  

According  
to  
news  >ARG0
accounts*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
company  >>ARG0
is*  
struggling*  
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
many  
fond  
memories  <ARG1
of  
my  
college  
evenings  
there  
long  
ago  
.  

So  
long  >>ARGM-DIS
Ham  
s  
...  
you  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
missed*  
.  

We  >>ARG1
are*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
pleased*  
with  
the  
services*  
of  
First  
Glass  
Window  <ARG1
.  

Our  
window  
panes  >>ARG1
were*  
so  >ARGM-CXN
dirty*  
that  
they  >ARG0
needed*  
a  
specialist  >>ARG0
to  
come*  
and  
clean*  
them  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
called*  
few  
companies  <ARG1
before  
we  >>ARG0
decide*  
to  
hire*  
them  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
came*  
on  
time  <ARGM-TMP
and  
completed*  
their  >ARG0
work*  
quickly  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

We  >>ARG1
were*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
happy*  
how  
clean  >ARG1
looked*  
our  
windows  <ARG0
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
have*  >ARGM-ADV
some  
problems  <ARG1
with  
your  
windows  
,  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
call*  
them  <ARG1
.  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
help*  
even  
near  
closing  
time  
!  

I  >>ARG0
came*  
in  
to  
town  <ARG4
for  
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
and  
forgot*  
my  
trainers  <ARG1
!  

Oh  
no  
!!  

I  >ARG1
came*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
30  
min  
before  
close*  
and  
the  
staff  >>ARG0
was*  
super  >ARGM-EXT
helpful*  
.  

They  >>ARG0
spent*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
time  
with  
me  <ARGM-COM
and  
got*  
me  <ARG1
into  
a  
great  
pair  <ARG1
of  
shoes  
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
they  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
even  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
better*  
than  
the  
pair  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
using*  
this  
past  
year  <ARGM-TMP
!  

Thanks*  
Run  
on  <ARGM-DIS
!  

Great  

This  >ARG1
is*  
a  
perfect  
place  >ARGM-LOC
to  
get*  
your  
hair  >ARG1
done*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
gone*  
there  <ARG4
time  <ARGM-TMP
and  
time  
again  
whenever  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
get*  
my  
hair  >ARG1
done*  
or  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
want*  
a  
haircut  <ARG1
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
get*  >>ARGM-TMP
my  
hair  >ARG1
done*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
,  
they  >ARG0
use*  
enough  
hairstyling  
products  <ARG1
while  
it  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
ruin*  
your  
hair  <ARG1
.  

The  
service*  >>ARG1
is*  
great*  
and  
during  
weekends  >ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
tends*  
to  
get*  
busy*  
,  
but  
the  
wait  >>ARG1
is*  
worthwhile*  
.  

Highly  >ARGM-EXT
Recommend*  

I  >>ARG1
have*  
worked*  
with  
Shannon  <ARG3
as  
my  
massage  
therapist  
and  
intuitive  
bodyworker  
for  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
have*  
never  >>ARGM-NEG
been*  
disappointed*  
.  

No  
matter  >>ARGM-ADV
what  
state  >ARG2
I  >ARG1
am*  
in  <C-ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
arrive*  
,  
I  >>ARG1
always  >ARGM-TMP
leave*  
feeling*  
better*  
.  

She  >>ARG0
has*  
not  
only  
helped*  
me  <ARG2
through  
some  
challenging  >>ARGM-ADJ
computer  >ARG1
-  
work*  
and  
sports  
related  >ARG2
injuries*  
,  
she  >>ARG1
was*  
wonderful*  
to  
work*  
with  <ARG3
throughout  
my  
pregnancy  <ARGM-TMP
and  
beyond  
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
her  <ARG1
.  

Best  
Store  
In  
Boothbay  
Harbor  

What  
a  
fantastic  
store  
,  
I  >ARG0
love*  
this  
place  <ARG1
.  

Not  
the  
same  
old  
stuff  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
all  
the  
other  
stores  >ARG0
have*  
.  

Their  
items  >>ARG1
are*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
unique*  
,  
great  
quality  
,  
great  >ARGM-MNR
prices*  
.  

They  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
have*  
the  
best  
tea  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had*  
,  
not  
at  
all  
like  
the  
junk  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
get*  
at  
the  
grocery  
stores  <ARGM-LOC
,  
I  >ARG0
stock*  
up  
when  
ever  
there  <ARGM-TMP
because  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
closed*  
in  
the  
winter  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
BEST  

Dr.  >>ARG1
Aster  
and  
her  
team  
have*  
been*  
a  
strong  
advocate  <ARG2
in  
the  
health  
of  
both  
my  
daughters  
.  

Dr.  >ARG1
Aster  
is*  
very  
kind  <ARG2
an  
gentle  
with  
the  
children  
,  
but  
also  
positive  
and  
to  
the  
point  
with  
the  
parents  
.  

She  >ARG1
is*  
and  
excellent  
doctor  >ARG1
to  
have*  
on  
one  
's  
team  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Even  
though  
I  >ARG0
live*  >>ARGM-ADV
pretty  
far  <ARGM-LOC
from  
her  
office  
I  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
make*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
trip*  
so  
my  
daughters  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
the  
BEST  <ARG1
!  

My  
wife  >>ARG0
and  
I  
avoided*  
doing*  >ARGM-LVB
some  
fairly  
simple  >ARGM-ADV
electrical  >ARG1
re-wiring*  
in  
our  
home  <ARGM-LOC
for  
several  
years  <ARGM-TMP
due  
to  
overall  >ARGM-ADJ
hassle*  >ARG1
and  
cost  
involved*  
.  

I  >ARG0
finally  >ARGM-TMP
called*  
Matt  <ARG1
from  
Bonafide  
and  
he  >ARG0
made*  
the  
project  >>ARG1
both  
easy*  
for  
us  <ARGM-GOL
and  
reasonable*  
.  

He  >ARG1
was*  
prompt  <ARG2
,  
knowledgable  
,  
friendly  
,  
clean  
and  
just  
an  
overall  
great  
guy  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
obviously  >ARGM-ADV
cares*  
about  
his  
business  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
reccommend*  
his  >ARG0
services*  
however  <<ARGM-ADV
/  
whenever  
possible  
!  

Real  
pros  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
had*  
writer  
friends  >ARG0

their

I  >ARG0
tell*  
them  <ARG2
:  
why  >ARGM-CAU

The

Neptune

Monday  >ARGM-TMP

I  >>ARG1
was*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
happy*  
with  
the  
way*  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
looked*  
,  
very  
wavy  
,  
uneven  
edges  
,  
and  
with  
the  
exception*  >ARGM-ADV
of  
1  <ARG1
,  
there  
is*  
a  
dip  <ARG1
in  
the  
center  
of  
each  
nail  
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
had*  
a  
pedicure  <ARG1

my  
nails  >ARG1
too  >ARGM-EXT
short*  
,  
one  >ARG0
of  
my  
big

I  >ARG1
'm*  
certainly  <ARGM-ADV
no  
expert  <ARG2
on  
asian  
food  
in  
fact  
not  
even  
a  
lover  
of  
Vietnamese  
food  
but  
I  >>ARG0
wanted*  
to  
try*  
the  
real  
things  <ARG1
here  
at  
A  
Dong

Cold  >ARG1

The  
asparagus  >ARG1

the  
best  >ARG1

Then  >ARGM-TMP
the

they  >ARG1
were*  
out  <ARG2

the  
day  <ARGM-TMP
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
go*  
way  
before  
they  >ARG1
close*  
.  

Got*  
the

and  
shrimp

As  
a

can  >ARGM-MOD
tell*  
you  <ARG2

not  <ARGM-NEG
authentic  
Mexican  
food  <ARG2
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS

I  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
like*

Esp.  
the  
mole

My  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADJ

is*  
the  
QUESO  <ARG2
.  

It  >>ARG1
used*  
to  
be*  
fabulous*  
,  
why  >>ARGM-CAU
did*  
you  
guys  >ARG0
change*  
it  <ARG1
??  

Queso  >ARG1

.  

In  
fact  >ARGM-ADV
my  
friend  >ARG0
vomited*  
after  
our  
meal  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Maybe  >ARGM-DIS
we  >ARG0
ordered*  
the  
wrong  
dish  <ARG1
but  
my  >ARG0
experience*  >>ARG2
here  <ARGM-LOC
was*  
poor*  
.  

Service*  >>ARG1

okay  <ARG2
not  >ARGM-NEG
great*  
,  
we  >ARG1
came*  
for  
a

Good  
Pizza  
at  
a  
good  >ARGM-MNR
price*  

I  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-TMP
moved*  
nearby  <ARG2

this  >ARG1
was*  
the  
first  
one  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
stuck*  
with  
it  <ARG2
.  

The  
pizza  >>ARG1
is*  
usually  >ARGM-TMP
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
good*

the  
only  
bad  
one  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
got*  
was*  
on

it  >>ARG1
just  >ARGM-ADV
needed*  
to  
be*  
cooked*  
a  
little  
more  <ARGM-EXT
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
good*  
.  

Their  
BBQ  
chicken  
pizza  >ARG1
is*  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
better  
ones  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had*  
.

They  >ARG0

you  <ARGM-MNR

if  
you  >ARG0

after

is*  
probably  <ARGM-ADV
a  
question*  
of  
practice  <ARG1
.  

A  
wonderful  
place  
,  
if  
you  >ARG0

do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem*  
to  
be*  
interested*  
in  
selling*

Went*  
there  <ARG4
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP

are*  
trying*  
to  
decide*  
between  
two

so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0
wanted*  
to  
test  >ARGM-PRP

drive*  
both  <ARG1

.  

The

for  
two  
test  >ARGM-PRP

.  

We  >ARG1
were*  
the

Do*

time  <ARG1
,  
just  >ARGM-ADV
drive*  
10  
minutes  
more  <ARGM-TMP
down  <ARG1
to  
Stevens

,  
they  >>ARG0

their

Good  
place  >ARG2
to  
be*  
on  
a  
Sunday  
Night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
beers  >>ARG1
were*  
good*  
,  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
choice*  
of  
beers  <ARG2
as  
well  
,  
and  
as  
usual  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
mussels  >>ARG1
were*  
great*  
,  
the  
place  >ARG1
upstairs  
is*  
a  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
addition*  
to  
the  
bar  <ARG2
downstairs  
.  

Filled*  
up  
on  
too  
much  
beer  <ARG2
and  
hence  >ARGM-ADV
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
comment*  
on  
the  
food  <ARG3
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
the  
menu  >ARG0
had*  
standard

that  >R-ARG1
one  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
at  
a

.  

If  
you  >ARG1

this  >ARG1
is*  
a

.  

Perfect  
Location  
plus  

I  >ARG1
moved*  
into  
the  
Tanglewood

in  
late  
2008  <ARGM-TMP
and  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
been*  
a  
refreshing*  >ARGM-PRD
change*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
used*  
to  
live*  
at  
Meadowrun  <ARGM-LOC
and  
that  >ARG1
was*  
a

.  

The

-  
Tiffany  
-  
is*  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
very  >ARGM-EXT
nice*  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
a  
bit  >ARGM-EXT
surprised*  
by  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
comments*  
.  

She  >ARG1
's*  
very  
reachable  <ARG2
and  
she  >>ARG0
has*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
responded*  
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
to  
any  
questions*  
or  
requests*  
.  

Plus  >ARGM-DIS
she  >ARG0
plans*  
a  
monthly

and  
other  
events  
at  
the  
clubhouse  
which  >ARG1
is*  
a  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
added  >ARGM-PRD
benefit*  
.  

great  >>ARGM-ADJ
service*  
/  
deals*  
-  
support*  
this  
local  
business  <ARG1

I  >>ARG0
have*  
used*  
these  
guys  <ARG1
for  
new  
snows  <ARG2
,  
fixing*  
lots  <ARG1
of  
flats  
,  
used  
replacement  
tires  <<ARG2
,  
and  
oil  >ARG1
changes*  
.  

They  >ARG0
have*  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
prices*  
locally  <ARGM-LOC
and  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
customer  >ARG2
service*  
.  

One  
guy  >ARG1
is*  
a  
little  
surley  <ARG2
,  
but  
who  >ARG0
gives*  
a  
crap  <ARG1
as  
long  <ARGM-ADV
as  
your  
car  >ARG1
's  
work*  >ARG1
is*  
outstanding  <ARG2
.  

AND  
they  >>ARG0
're*  
usually  >ARGM-TMP
able*  
to  
help*  
you  <ARG2
as  
a  
walk  
-  
in  <ARGM-PRD
,  
and  
they  >>ARG1
're*  
fast*  
.  

Overall  
-  
good  
stuff  
.  

Another  
great  
business  >ARG0
bites*  
the  
dust  <ARG1
!  

The  
best  
cakes  
EVER  
!  

A  
bit  
pricey  
,  
so  >>ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
very  
often  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
was*  
always  <ARGM-TMP
a  
treat  <ARG2
when  
I  
did*  
.  

The  
prices*  >>ARG1
were*  
worth*  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
got*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
assuming*  
they  >ARG1
are*  
completely  <ARGM-EXT
out  
of  
business  <ARG2
since  
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
find*  
any  
contact  
information  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
hoping*  
the  
bakers  >>ARG0
continue*  
to  
do*  >ARGM-LVB
their  >ARGM-GOL
baking*  
out  
of  
another  
place  <ARGM-LOC
,  
because  
it  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
shame*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
have*  
these  
cakes  <ARG1
any  
longer  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Super  
nice  
people  
,  
really  
good  
food  

What  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
love*  
most  <ARGM-EXT
about  
this  
place  <ARGM-ADV
,  
other  <ARGM-ADV
than  
the  
food  
,  
is*  
that  
eating*  >ARG0
here  <ARGM-LOC
makes*  
you  >ARG0
feel*  
like  
you  >ARG1
're*  
in  
a  
small  
town  <ARG2
rather  
than  
Baltimore  
.  

The  
owners  >>ARG1
are*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
nice*  
,  
they  >ARG0
serve*  
good  
food  <ARG1
at  
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
price*  
,  
and  
the  
option  >>ARG1
to  
eat*  
outside  <ARGM-LOC
on  
the  
deck  <ARGM-LOC
(  
esp  
on  
the  
weekend  >>ARGM-TMP
whether  
there  
is*  
hardly  <ARGM-ADV
any  
traffic  <ARG1
)  
is*  
great*  
.  

One  
of  
my  
top  
5  
places  >ARGM-LOC
to  
eat*  
in  
Baltimore  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Overpriced  

This  
place  >>ARG1
is*  
identical*  
to  
the  
Youngstown  
Sports  
Grille  <ARG2
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
imagine*  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
owned*  
/  
operated*  
by  
the  
same  
people  <ARG0
.  

The  
food  >ARG1
is*  
mediocre  <ARG2
at  
best  <ARGM-ADV
,  
and  
largely  
overpriced  
given  
the  
portion  
size  
and  
quality  
.  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
get*  
me  >ARG0
started*  
on  
how  
expensive  >ARG2
it  
is*  
to  
drink*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
ate*  
here  <ARGM-LOC
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
since  
they  >ARG1
first  >ARGM-TMP
opened*  
,  
and  
the  
service*  >>ARG2
has*  
been*  
poor*  
each  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
staff  >ARG1
always  >ARGM-TMP
comes*  
across  
as  
somewhat  
rude  <ARG3
and  
slow  
.

so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
had*  
the  
salmon  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
good*  
but  
the  
steaks  >>ARG0
looked*  
amazing*  
and  
if  
I  >ARG1
am*  
in

again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
order*  
a  
steak  <ARG1
.  

A  
perfect

for

romantic  
dinner

Lots

pretty

Great

Very  
helpful  
!!!!  

They  >>ARG0
interviewed*  
me  <ARG1
,  
gave*  
me  <ARG2
tests*  
in  
the  
software  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
included*  
on  
my

placed*

that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
kept*  
for  
several  
years  <ARGM-TMP

Re-interviewed*

am*

I  >ARG1
'm*  
really  
thankful  <ARG2
for  
the  
folks  
at  
HR  
Office  
.  

They  >>ARG1
are*  
dependable  <ARG2
,  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
great  >ARGM-ADJ
connections*  
in  
the  
community  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
are*  
a  
great  
resource  <ARG2
for  
finding*  
a  
job  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
them  <ARG1
to  
all  <ARG2
of  
my  
friends  
!!!!  
!  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
-  
consider*  
checking*  
out  
their  
puppies  <ARG1
before  
buying*  
from  
a  
breeder  <ARG2
!  

I  >ARG0
adopted*  
a  
3.5  
month  
old  
yellow  
lab  <ARG1
last  
winter  <ARGM-TMP
from  
the  
Dumb  
Friends  
League  <ARGM-DIR
.  

The  
staff  >>ARG0
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful*  
in  
finding*  
the  
right  
dog  <ARG1
for  
me  
and  
the  
care*  >>ARG1
my  
pup  >ARG0
received*  
was*  
outstanding  <ARG2
.  

If  
you  >ARG1
are*  
on  
the  
lookout  >>ARGM-ADV
for  
a  
pure  
breed  
pup  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
forget*  
to  
check*  
out  
the  
shelters  <ARG1
!  

My  
pup  >>ARG1
has*  
a  
wonderful  
temperment  <ARG1
and  
has*  
been*  
a  
wonderful  >ARGM-ADJ
addition*  
to  
my  
family  <ARG2
!  

Food  
good  
,  
service*  
poor  

No  
silverware  
,  
asked*  
for  
a  
spoon  <ARG1
for  
my  
son  
s  
mac  
and  
cheese  
ended*  
up  
having*  
to  
use*  
my  
tea  
spoon  <ARG1
.  

Asked*  
for  
bar  
-  
b  
-  
que  
sauce  <ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
got*  
it  <ARG1
.  

Never  >ARGM-NEG
checked*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
with  
us  <ARG1
once  
we  >ARG0
got*  
our  
food  <ARG1
.  

Had*  
to  
go*  
the  
the  
bus  
boy  
s  
station  <ARG4
ourselves  <ARGM-REC
to  
get*  
napkins  <ARG1
.  

Only  
one  
server  
,  
too  
buys  
talking*  
with  
others  <ARG2
I  >ARG0
guess*  
.  

Food  >>ARG1
was*  
good*  
,  
but  
service*  >ARG1
means*  
a  
lot  <ARG2
to  
me  <ARG3
.  

Dr.  >ARGM-DIS
Chao  
you  >ARG1
are*  
the  
best  
dentist  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had*  
.  

You  >>ARG0
are*  
knowledgeable*  
,  
professional  
,  
gentel  
and  
kind*  
.  

I  >ARG0
wish*  
I  >ARG0
had*  
you  <ARG1
as  
my  
dentist  <ARGM-PRD
early  
on  <ARGM-TMP
in  
my  
life  
-  
maybe  >>ARGM-ADV
my  
teeth  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
a  
lot  >ARGM-CXN
better*  
then  
they  >ARG1
are*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
However  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG1
am*  
glad*  
you  >ARG1
are*  
my  
dentist  <ARG2
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Even  
though  
you  >>ARG1
are*  
expensive*  
.  

Thank*  
you  >>ARG0
for  
helping*  
to  
preserve*  
my  
teeth  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG1
are*  
meticulous  <ARG2
in  
your  >ARG0
work*  
and  
it  >ARG1
shows*  
in  
my  
smile  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Con  
Garage  

I  >ARG0
brought*  
my  
car  <ARG1
in  <ARG3
for  
a  
simple  >ARGM-ADJ
emissions  >ARG1
test*  
.  

I  >ARG0
guess*  
they  >>ARG0
figured*  
me  <ARG1
for  
an  
easy  >ARGM-ADJ
mark*  
,  
and  
tried*  
to  
explain*  
that  
my  
car  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
pass*  
unless  
I  >ARG0
replaced*  
a  
hose  <ARG1
.  

Ten  
minutes  
later  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
took*  
my  
car  <ARG1
down  
the  
street  <ARGM-DIR
and  
it  >ARG1
passed*  
the  
emissions  >ARG1
test*  
with  
flying  
colors  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

If  
you  >ARG1
're*  
a  
fan  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
herpes  
,  
being*  
ripped*  
off  
,  
and  
child  
molesters  
,  
this  >ARG1
is*  
the  
garage  <ARG2
for  
you  
.  

If  
not  >ARGM-ADV
,  
go*  
somewhere  <ARG4
else  
.  

Rude  >ARGM-MNR
service*  

even  
though  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
tried*  >ARGM-ADV
hoa  
salon  <ARG1
but  
I  >ARG0
agree*  
with  
other  
reviewers  <ARG2
that  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
rude*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
called*  
and  
asked*  
about  
the  
price*  
for  
hair  
updo  <ARG1
and  
the  
receptionist  >>ARG0
or  
owner  
who  >R-ARG0
aswered*  
the  
phone  <ARG1
refused*  
to  
tell*  
me  <ARG2
,  
or  
even  >ARGM-ADV
just  >ARGM-ADV
give*  
me  <ARG2
an  
approximate  
price  
range  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
told*  
us  >ARG0
to  
stop*  
by*  
the  
salon  <ARG1
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
tell*  
us  <ARG2
the  
price*  
.  

What  
kind  >>ARG2
of  
rude  >ARGM-MNR
service*  
is*  
that  <ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
waste*  
my  
time  <ARG1
with  
them  <ARG2
.  

Top  
notch  
eats  
!  

So  >ARGM-ADV
here  >ARGM-LOC
we  >ARG1
are*  
in  
Manson  <ARG2
.  

Manson  
?  

Yes  
,  
Manson  
.  

Right  
near  
Chelan  
.  

Aka  
Nowheresville  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
this  
litttle  
gem  >ARG1
of  
a  
7  
-  
table  
restaurant  
is*  
a  
complete  >ARGM-EXT
and  
utterly  
wonderful  
surprise*  
.  

A  
short  
but  
wide  
-  
ranging  
menu  >ARG1
executed*  
with  
innovative  >ARGM-ADJ
perfection*  
in  
a  
cozy  
hole  <<ARGM-LOC
in  
the  
wall  
just  
off  
the  
main  
street  
.  

Fantastic  
food  >ARG1
served*  
without  
pretense  <ARGM-MNR
,  
very  
reasonably  
priced  >ARGM-ADJ
wine  >ARG1
selections*  
.  

A  
great  
place  >ARG4
to  
go*  
for  
dinner  <ARG1
after  
a  
day  <ARGM-TMP
of  
wine  >ARG1
tasting*  
.  

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
Service*  
and  
Reasonable  >ARGM-ADJ
Prices*  

Boutique  
stores  >>ARG1
dealing*  
in  
children  
's  
clothing  <ARG2
/  
gifts  
are*  
often  >ARGM-TMP
outrageously  >ARGM-MNR
priced*  
(  
who  >>ARG0
wants*  
to  
pay*  
40  
dollars  <ARG1
for  
a  
newborn  
onesie  <ARG3
?  
)  

but  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
pleasantly  >ARGM-MNR
surprised*  
to  
find*  
that  
the  
Purple  
Goose  >ARG0
's  
prices*  >>ARG1
are*  
reasonable*  
(  
for  
the  
SAME  
products  >>ARGM-ADV
found*  
at  
other  
area  
boutiques  <ARGM-LOC
,  
the  
prices*  >>ARG1
were*  
20  
-  
25  
%  >ARG3
cheaper*  
)  
.  

The  
service*  >>ARG0
was*  
also  >>ARGM-DIS
excellent*  
-  
friendly*  
,  
helpful*  
and  
informative  
without  
being*  
overbearing*  
.  

Will  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
return*  
.  

Consistantly  
poor  

A  
lack*  >>ARG0
of  
organisation*  
,  
coupled*  
with  
the  
distain  <ARG2
for  
its  
customers  
,  
makes*  
this  <ARG1
the  
worst  
rental  
agency  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
used*  
.  

Chasing*  
them  <ARG1
on  
issues*  
from  
the  
day  <ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
moved*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
(  
many  
of  
them  
still  
unresolved  
as  
I  >ARG0
left*  
)  
to  
all  
sorts  <<ARGM-ADV
of  
farcical  >ARGM-ADJ

with  
funds  <ARG0
,  
after  
I  >ARG0
left*  
.  
.  
.  
.  
as  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
as  
I  
could  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
use*  >>ARGM-ADV
them  <ARG1
,  
be*  
vigilant*  
and  
be*  
ready*  
to  
push*  
,  
if  
you  >ARG0

elsewhere  <ARG4

I  
would

Ipanema  <ARG2
.  

But  
my  
wife  >>ARG0
and  
I  
first  >ARGM-TMP
went*  
there  <ARG4
thinking*  
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
Brazilian  
food  <ARG2
(  
think*  
lots  <ARG1
of  
meat  
)  
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
turned*  
out  
to  
be*  
a  
vegan  
restaurant  <ARG2
!  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
,  
this  >ARG1
was*  
one  <ARG2
of  
my  
favorite  
places  >ARGM-LOC
to  
eat*  
in  
all  <ARGM-LOC
of  
Richmond  
.  

Amazing  
!  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
let*  
the  
nondescript  
building  
entrance  >ARG0
fool*  
you  <ARG1
,  
these  >ARG1
are*  
some  
creative  
and  
talented  
chefs  <ARG2
...  
two  
thumbs  
way  
,  
way  
up  
!  

Excellent  
food  
,  
fantastic  
wait  
staff  

I  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
threw*  
a  
surprise  >ARGM-ADJ
birthday  >ARGM-ADJ
party*  
for  
my  
wife  <<ARGM-GOL
at  
Fraiser  <<ARGM-LOC
's  
.  

We  >ARG0
had*  
30  
guests  <ARG1
for  
the  
event  
,  
and  
everyone  >>ARG1
came*  
away  <ARG3
from  
the  
evening  
impressed*  
with  
not  
only  
the  
food  <ARG0
,  
but  
the  
outstanding  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
as  
well  
.  

The  
management*  >>ARG1
was*  
easy*  
to  
deal*  
with  <ARG1
during  
the  
planning  
stages  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
the  
execution*  >ARG1
by  
the  
kitchen  
and  
wait  
staff  <ARG0
was*  
flawless  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
Fraiser  <ARG1
's  
for  
anyone  >ARG0
planning*  
a  
special  
event  <ARG1
for  
friends  
,  
family  
or  
business  
.  

FANTASTIC  
STORE  
!!!  

I  >ARG0
came*  
upon*  
this  
store  <ARG1
as  
the  
building  >ARG0
caught*  
my  
eye  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
located*  
in  
the  
huge  
HONKA  
Log  
Homes  
building  <ARGM-LOC
,  
by  
Walmart  <ARGM-LOC
off  
of  
Evergreen  
Parkway  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
store  >>ARG1
was*  
decorated*  
with  
furnishings  <ARG2
&  
accessories  
.  

The  
friendly  
crew  >>ARG0
working*  
was*  
great*  
&  
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful*  
.  

This  
store  >ARG1
is*  
what  <ARG2
Colorado  >ARG1
is*  
all  <ARG2
about  <ARG2
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
purchased*  
some  
furniture  <ARG1
last  
year  <ARGM-TMP
and  
all  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
great*  
!  

It's  >ARG0
durability  >>ARG1
&  
look*  
was*  
perfect*  
and  
I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
definitely  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
adding*  
to  
my  >ARG0
collection*  
soon  <<ARGM-TMP
!  

Lovely  
People  
,  
Great  
Hats  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
saddened*  
to  
see*  
the  
reviews*  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
claimed*  
World  
Hats  
Mart  
has*  >ARGM-LVB
poor  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
.  

It  >ARG0
led*  
me  >ARG0
to  
believe*  
that  
the  
reviewers  >ARG0
simply  >ARGM-ADV
had*  
difficulty  <ARG1
tolerating  
people  
with  
strongly  
-  
accented  
English  
.  

The  
husband  >>ARG1
and  
wife  
who  >R-ARG0
run*  
this  
spot  <ARG1
are*  
lovely  
people  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG0
have*  
had*  >ARGM-LVB
many  >ARGM-ADJ
conversations*  
with  
them  <ARG2
and  
they  >>ARG1
have*  
always  >>ARGM-TMP
been*  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
patient*  
with  
me  <ARG2
as  
I  >ARG0
tried*  
on  <ARGM-PRD
multiple  
hats  <ARG1
in  
search*  
of  
the  
right  
costumes  <ARG2
for  
my  
magic  
act  
.  

I  >ARG0
recommend*  
them  <ARG1
highly  <ARGM-EXT
!  

DO*  
NT  >ARGM-NEG
ever  >ARGM-TMP
go*  
there  <ARG4
,  
not  
even  
if  
your  
car  >ARG1
flips*  
.  

Their  >ARG0
service*  >>ARG1
sucks*  
to  
start*  
off  
with  <ARGM-ADV
,  
people  >>ARG1
are*  
cruel*  
and  
ignorant*  
.  

I  >ARG1
'm*  
compeltly  
dissatisfied  <ARG2
with  
their  >ARG0
service*  
and  
their  
products  
.  

They  >>ARG0
DO*  
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
a  
return  
policy  <ARG1
and  
even  
if  
their  
product  >ARG0
SUCKS*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
take*  
it  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
!  

DO*  
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
EVER  >ARGM-TMP
GO*  
HERE  <ARG4
.  

I  >ARG0
prefer*  
Advanced  
auto  
parts  <ARG1
over  
this  
crappy  
place  <ARG2
with  
the  
meanest  
people  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG0
THRIVE*  
to  
get*  
a  
customer  <ARG1
.  

DO*  
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
here  <ARG4
..  
thank*  
you  <ARG1

Horrible  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
growing*  
my  
hair  <ARG1
out  <ARGM-ADV
for  
1  
year  <ARGM-TMP
plus  
and  
went*  
in  <ARG4
to  
get*  
1  
inch  >ARG1
taken*  
off  
.  

I  >ARG0
walked*  
out  <ARG2
with  
5  
inch  
long  
hair  <ARGM-MNR
on  
the  
top  
,  
2  
inch  
long  
hair  
on  
the  
sides  
,  
and  
1.5  
in  
the  
back  
.  

My  
hair  >ARG1
is*  
uneven  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG0
looks*  
rediculous  <ARG1
.  

This  
woman  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
working*  
in  
supercuts  <ARG2
...  
if  
that  <ARGM-ADV
.  

This  >ARG1
was*  
a  
terrible  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
and  
I  >ARG0
hope*  
that  
no  
one  >ARG1
else  
goes*  
through  
that  <ARG2
.  

Do*  
your  
self  <ARG2
a  
favor  <ARG1
and  
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
to  
this  
establishment  <ARG4
.  

The  
worst  
Burger  
King  
restaurant  
!!!  

I  >ARG0
generally  >ARGM-ADV
like*  
the  
BK  <ARG1
over  
the  
other  
fast  
serving  
restaurants  <ARGM-ADV
;  
however  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
regreted*  
to  
visit*  
this  
restaurant  <ARG1
at  
my  
town  
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
a  
shame*  
of  
my  
adorable  
town  <ARG0
,  
Branford  
.  

I  >>ARG0
ordered*  
a  
kid  
meal  <ARG1
with  
a  
milk  
and  
found*  
a  
bottle  >>ARG1
was*  
half  >ARGM-EXT
opened*  
already  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
asked*  
them  >ARG0
to  
change*  
it  <ARG1
but  
they  >ARG0
rudely  >ARGM-MNR
said*  
that  
it  >ARG1
was*  
okay  <ARG2
.  

Disgusting  
french  
fries  >ARG1
is*  
very  
best  
menu  <ARG2
.  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
,  
or  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
learn*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
waste*  
your  
money  <ARG1
.  

Disappointed  

The  
Bad  
:  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
at  
Napa  <ARG2
recently  <ARGM-TMP
and  
was*  
unpleasantly  >ARGM-MNR
surprised*  
at  
poor  
waiter  
svce  <ARG0
and  
subpar  
food  
.  

We  >ARG1
were*  
a  
party  <ARG2
of  
4  
and  
none  >>ARG1
of  
us  
were*  
particularly  >ARGM-ADV
pleased*  
with  
our  
dishes  <ARG0
.  

Napa  >>ARG0
is*  
all  
about  
wine  <ARG2
but  
gives*  >ARGM-LVB
very  
short  >ARGM-ADJ
descriptions*  
of  
the  
wines  <ARG1
on  
their  
lists  
.  

I  >ARG0
found*  
my  >ARG0
initial  >ARGM-TMP
selection*  >ARG1
satisfactory*  
but  
the  
wine  >ARGM-ADJ
flight*  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
chose*  
to  
be*  
poorly  
composed  <ARG2
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
go*  >ARGM-ADV
ask*  
lots  <ARG1
of  
questions*  
about  
your  >ARG0
selections*  
since  
your  >ARG0
expectations*  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
as  >ARGM-CXN
high*  
as  
mine  >ARG1
were*  
.  

Highly  >ARGM-EXT
Recommended*  

We  >>ARG0
walked*  
in  <ARG2
to  
pick*  
our  
little  
man  <ARG1
at  
10  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
to  
closing  
and  
heard*  
laughter  <ARG1
from  
kids  <ARG2
and  
the  
staff  
.  

The  
facilities  >>ARG1
are*  
more*  
than  
adequate  <ARG2
and  
the  
staff  >ARG1
are*  
just  <ARGM-ADV
phenomenal  <ARG2
.  

Their  
sense*  >>ARG0
of  
humour  
and  
calmness  
when  >R-ARGM-TMP
dealing*  
with  
the  
little  
ones  <ARG1
amazes*  
me  <ARG1
every  
time  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
walk*  
in  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG1
have*  
since  >ARGM-TMP
moved*  
slightly  
further  <ARG2
away  
from  
the  
centre  
but  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
worth*  
the  
extra  >ARGM-ADJ
travel*  
,  
as  
the  
care*  >>ARG0
provided*  
exceeds*  
our  >ARG0
expectations*  
...  
especially  
after  
a  
few  >ARGM-ADJ
horrendous  >ARGM-ADJ
daycare  >ARG1
experiences*  
elsewhere  <ARGM-LOC
.  

HORRIBLE  
!!!!  
!  

This  >>ARG1
has*  
to  
be*  
some  <ARG2
of  
the  
worst  
pizza  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had*  
the  
misfortune  <ARG1
of  
ordering*  
.  

The  
crust  >ARG1
was*  
lopsided  <ARG2
,  
thicker  
on  
one  
side  
than  
the  
other  
.  

It  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
had*  
a  
hole  <ARG1
in  
one  
of  
the  
slices  
.  

There  
was*  
minimal  
cheese  <ARG1
and  
sauce  
and  
it  >ARG0
completely  >ARGM-EXT
lacked*  
flavor  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
New  
York  
pizza  <ARG1
and  
this  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
it  <ARG2
!!  

This  >ARG1
was*  
nothing  <ARG2
like  
New  
York  
style  
pizza  
!!!.  

I  >ARG0
love*  
pizza  <ARG1
and  
this  >ARG1
was*  
a  
complete  >ARGM-EXT
and  
utter  
disappointment*  
!!  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
suggest*  
this  
pizza  <ARG1
to  
anyone  <ARG2
!!!  

best  >ARGM-ADJ
quote*  
ever  <ARGM-TMP
My  
gate  >>ARG1
was*  
stuck*  
halfway  >ARGM-EXT
open*  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
called*  
A  
CLASS  >ARGM-ADJ
Garage  
Doors  >ARG1
Dr  >ARG0
Services*  
.  

They  >>ARG0
came*  
to  
my  
house  <ARG4
in  
no  
time  <ARGM-TMP
and  
started*  
working*  
on  
the  
gate  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
were*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
friendly*  
and  
were*  
able*  
to  
explain*  
me  <ARG2
exactly  
what  >>ARG1
was*  
wrong*  
with  
it  <ARG2
.  

Once  
they  >ARG0
fixed*  >>ARGM-TMP
it  <ARG1
they  >>ARG0
answetred*  
all  <ARG1
of  
my  >ARG0
questions*  
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
hesitations*  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
gave*  
me  <ARG2
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
quote*  
ever  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
know*  
that  
if  
my  
garage  
door  >>ARG1
needs*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
be*  
repaired*  
,  
I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
calling*  
A  
CLASS  
Garage  
Doors  <ARG1

You  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
happy*  
at  
this  
store  <ARGM-LOC
!  

Allen  >>ARG1
Tire  
was*  
recommended*  
by  
friend  <ARG0
after  
my  >>ARG0
having*  >ARGM-LVB
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
tire  >ARG1
experiences*  
in  
Temecula  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
store  
manager  >>ARG0
,  
Jim  
Smith  
,  
made*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
tire  >ARG1
recommendation*  
for  
my  
newly  
acquired  
Lexus  <ARG2
.  

Tires  >ARG1
were*  
the  
right  >ARGM-ADJ
price*  
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
the  
car  >ARG1
feels*  
like  
it  >>ARG0
is*  
riding*  
on  
rails  <ARG1
around  
turns*  
.  

The  
store  >>ARG1
is*  
clean  <ARG2
,  
run*  
very  
professionally  <ARGM-MNR
and  
a  
pleasure  >ARG2
to  
be*  
in  <C-ARG2
.  

They  >ARG0
know*  
their  
job  <ARG1
and  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
not  
have*  
to  
watch*  
them  <ARG1
to  
be*  
sure*  
everything  >>ARG1
is*  
done*  
right*  
.  

Easiest  
Time  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had*  
purchasing*  
a  
car  <ARG1
!  

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
,  
Not  
only  
did  
they  >ARG0
get*  
the  
exact  
car  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
wanted*  
win  
in  
48  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
but  
the  
sales  
man  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
took*  
me  <ARG1
out  <ARG3
to  
lunch  
.  

Very  
kind  
and  
reliable  
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
this  
dealership  <ARG1
if  
you  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
like*  
to  
hassle*  
on  
price*  
and  
receive*  
friendly  >ARGM-MNR
service*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
since  >ARGM-TMP
purchased*  
two  
cars  <ARG1
from  
this  
dealership  <ARG2
,  
The  
first  
one  >ARG1
was*  
from  
Phillip  <ARG2
and  
the  
second  >ARG1
was*  
from  
Richard  <ARG2
.  

Both  >ARG1
were*  
excellent  
sales  
men  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
put*  
my  >ARG0
needs*  
first  <<ARG2
.  

This  
place  >>ARG0
has*  
done*  
a  
great  
job  <ARG1
of  
taking*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
the  
usual  >ARGM-ADJ
maintenance*  
on  
my  
hooptie  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-DIS
never  
have*  
to  
wait*  
long  <ARGM-TMP
for  
a  
yearly  
inspection  
sticker  <ARG2
...  
and  
never  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
the  
usual  >ARGM-ADJ
excuses*  >ARG1
other  
shops  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
gave*  
me  <ARG2
...  
"  
the  
inspection  
guy  >ARG1
is*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
here  <ARG2
today  <ARGM-TMP
"  
....  
for  
example  
.  

Today  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
went*  
into  
Kwik  <ARG4
Kar  
and  
there  
were*  
two  
cars  <ARG1
in  
front  
of  
me  
for  
inspection*  
...  
but  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
still  <ARGM-ADV
out  
of  
there  <ARG2
pretty  
quick  <ARGM-TMP
...  
barely  >ARGM-ADV
had*  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
read*  
a  
chapter  <ARG1
in  
my  
book  
.  

Extremely  
helpful  
and  
professional  

As  
first  
-  
time  
home  
buyers  >ARGM-PRD
,  
my  
husband  >ARG0
and  
I  
found*  
Stephanie  >ARG0
Fairchild  
at  
Prudential  
Steamboat  
Realty  
,  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
helpful*  
.  

She  >>ARG0
worked*  
with  
us  <ARG3
for  
over  
a  
year  <ARGM-TMP

Great  
Barber  

Firstly  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
other  
reviewer  >>ARG1
clearly  >>ARGM-ADV
has*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
been*  
to  
Nick  <ARG2
's  
,  
or  
he  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
know*  
that  
Nick  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
charges*  
$  <ARG1
13  
for  
a  
haircut  <ARG3
which  >ARG1
is*  
pretty  
much  <ARGM-ADV
industry  
standard  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
going*  
to  
Nick  <ARG4
for  
5  
months  <ARGM-TMP
now  <ARGM-TMP
precisely  
because  
he  >>ARG0
does*  
pay*  >ARGM-LVB
attention*  
to  
detail  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
terrible  
hair  <ARG1
and  
he  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
takes*  
his  
time  <ARG1
to  
make*  
it  >>ARG1
look*  
right*  
.  

Some  >>ARG1
of  
the  
younger  
kids  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
work*  
there  <ARG2
are*  
a  
bit  
sub  
par  <ARG2
,  
but  
if  
you  >ARG1
wait*  >>ARGM-ADV
for  
Nick  <ARG2
...  
you  >>ARG1
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
good*  
.  

UGH  
!!!  

Got*  
some  
nice  
"  
freshly  >ARGM-TMP
baked*  
"  
fruit  
squares  <ARG1
,  
a  
personal  
favorite  
of  
mine  
.  

Took*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
bite*  
,  
it  >ARG1
tasted*  
odd  <ARG2
.  

Flipped*  
the  
square  <ARG1
over  <ARGM-PRD
and  
saw*  
it  <ARG1
riddled  
with  
green  
mold  
!!!!  

Ugh  
!!  

I  >ARG0
called*  
the  
store  <ARG1
and  
the  
clerk  >>ARG0
giggled*  
,  
and  
agreed*  
that  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
gross*  
,  
but  
said*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
her  
problem  <ARG2
.  

She  >>ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
refused*  
to  
get*  
a  
manager  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
left*  
my  
number  <ARG1
,  
or  
tried*  
to  <ARG1
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Same  
clerk  >>ARG0
had*  
considerable  
difficulty  <ARG1
taking*  
down  
a  
number  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
there  <ARGM-LOC
again  <ARGM-TMP

For  
cheap  
Chinese  
food  >ARGM-PRP
,  
this  >ARG1
is*  
the  
place  >ARG4
to  
go*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
used*  
to  
eat*  
at  
places  <ARGM-LOC
like  
New  
China  
or  
Green  
Buffet  
in  
Troy  
,  
MO  
-  
nothing  
terrible  
but  
not  
that  
great  
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
eat*  
fast  
food  <ARG1
Chinese  
unless  
it  >ARG1
's*  
from  
this  
place  <ARG2
.  

The  
best  
value  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
've*  
found*  
from  
a  
Chinese  
restaurant  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
live*  
in  
Lake  <ARGM-LOC
St.  
Louis  
anymore  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
deliveries*  >>ARG1
were*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
correct*  
and  
the  
service*  
courteous  
.  

Now  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
be*  
in  
the  
area  <ARG2
to  
get*  
some  
lovin'  <ARG1
:  
sad  
face  
:  

Amazing  >ARGM-ADJ
Experience*  
!  

My  >ARG0
experience*  >>ARG0
was*  
amazing*  
at  
Providence  
Aesthetics  <ARGM-LOC
and  
Medical  
Spa  
.  

Jana  >ARG1
Kueck  
was*  
nothing  <ARG2
but  
professional  
.  

She  >ARG0
makes*  
you  >ARG0
feel*  
like  
you  >ARG1
are*  
the  
most  
important  
person  <ARG2
in  
the  
world  
.  

Jana  >ARG0
made*  
me  >ARG0
feel*  
very  
comfortable  <ARG1
.  

Provided*  
me  <ARG2
with  
warm  
blanket  <ARG1
and  
has*  
soft  
music  >ARG1
playing*  
.  

Walking*  >>ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
door  <ARG2
you  >>ARG1
are*  
made*  
to  
feel*  
happy*  
and  
relaxed  
.  

Equipment  >ARG1
is*  
state  <ARG2
of  
the  
art  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
reccomend*  
anyone  >>ARG0
to  
go*  
see*  
Jana  <ARG1
Kueck  
and  
Robin  
Talley  
to  
see*  
all  
the  
many  >ARGM-ADJ
procedures*  >>ARG1
they  >ARG0
have*  
to  
offer*  
.  

Dave  >ARG1
is*  
a  
patient  
and  
methodical  
teacher  >ARG0
,  
who  >R-ARG0
has*  
a  
great  
ear  <ARG1
and  
sensitivity  
for  
his  
students  
'  
passion  
and  
the  
direction  >>ARGM-DIR
they  >ARG0
want*  
their  >ARG2
lessons*  >ARG1
to  
take*  
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >>ARG0
loves*  
teaching*  
so  
much  <ARGM-ADV
,  
his  >ARG0
price*  >ARG1
is*  
unbeatable  <ARG2
,  
but  
that  >>ARG0
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
change*  
his  
level  <ARG1
of  
skill  
.  

Dave  >ARG0
has*  
much  >ARG1
to  
offer*  
.  

In  
just  
2  >ARGM-ADJ
-  
3  
focused  >ARGM-PRD
lessons*  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
now  >ARGM-TMP
capable*  
of  
picking*  
up  
new  
songs  <ARG1
off  
YouTube  
guitar  
how  
to  
videos  <ARGM-DIR
and  
am*  
even  >ARGM-ADV
writing*  
my  
own  
orginals  <ARG1

confidence  <ARGM-MNR

We  >ARG0

you  <ARG1

the

Everything  >>ARG1

done*  
on  
a  
timely  
manner  <ARGM-MNR
and  
things  >>ARG1
were*  
cleaned*  
and  
picked*  
up  
every  
day  <ARGM-TMP
when  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
crew  >>ARG0
was*  
done*  
.  

We  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
liked*  
the  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
that  >R-ARGM-MNR
Ray  >ARG0
checked*  
on  
the  
job  <ARG1
every  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
when  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
job  >>ARG1

done*  >>ARGM-TMP
every  
thing  >>ARG1
was*  
cleaned*  
up  
and  
hauled*  
off  <ARGM-DIR
that  
same  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
hesitate*  
to  
use*  
Spears  
Roofing  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG0
have*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
recommended*  
you  <ARG1

worst  
places  >>ARG3
I  >>ARG1

stayed*  
,  
we  >>ARG0

out

The  
whole  >ARGM-ADJ

a

by  
what  >ARG1
must  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
2

hotel  
manager  <ARG2
.  

Bad  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  >ARG1
starting*  
from  
the  
front  
desk  <ARGM-DIR

The  
best  
person  >ARG1

a  
silver  
Marriott

this  >ARG1

a  
disgrace  <ARG2

BEST  
PLACE  
IN  
AMES  

I  >ARG0
lived*  
here  <ARGM-LOC
for  
two  
years  <ARGM-TMP
when  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
prices*  >>ARG1
were*  
a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
lower*  
:)  
The  
places  >ARG1
are*  
very  
nice  <ARG2
and  
clean  
,  
and  
in  
great  
condition  
!  

I  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-EXT
enjoyed*  
the  
staff  <ARG1
at  
Wessex  
,  
also  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
manager  >>ARG0
Sherri  
was*  
always  >>ARGM-TMP
very  >>ARGM-EXT
nice*  
and  
helpful*  
.  

The  
fitness

only

that  >R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
had*  
in  
2  
years  <ARGM-TMP

living*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
was*  
that  
the  
walls  >>ARG1
are*  
pretty  >ARGM-ADJ
thin*

my  
neighbors  >ARG0

me  >ARG1

running*  
in  
no  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Everyone  >>ARG0

and  
very  >ARGM-EXT

The  
service  
department  >>ARG0
even  >>ARGM-ADV
gave*  
me  <ARG2
a  
ride*  
home  <ARGM-DIR
and  
picked*  
me  <ARG1
up  <C-V
when  >>ARGM-TMP
my  
car  >>ARG1
was*  
finished*  
.  

The  
advisor  >ARG0
kept*  
me  <ARG1
up  
to  
date  <ARG2
and  
informed  
on  
the  
progress*  
of  
my  
vehicle  <ARG1

fine  
food  

The  
one  
-  
star  >ARGM-ADJ
review*  >ARG1
from  
2005  <ARGM-TMP
is*  
out  
of  
date  <ARG2
.  

There  
was*  
a  
change*  
of  
ownership*  
a  
couple  
of  
years  
ago  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
service*  >>ARG1
is*  
both  
quick*  
and  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
friendly*  
.  

The  
food  >>ARG1
continues*  
to  
be*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
good*  
--  
deli  
sandwiches  
,  
homemade  
soups  
,  
fresh  
salads  
.  

The  
atmosphere  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
for  
everyone  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
a  
bustling  
place  >>ARGM-LOC
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
separate  
parties  >>ARG1
are*  
seated*  
at  
the  
same  
table  <ARG2
(  
as  
in  
many  
European  
cafes  <ARGM-ADV
)  
,  
but  
if  
you  >ARG1

Best  
Car  
Dealer  
in  
TX  

I  >ARG0
purchased*  
a  
nissan  <ARG1
from  
this  
dealship  <ARG2
.  

The  
sales  
men  >>ARG0
were*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
knowledgeable*  
about  
every  
aspect  <ARG1
of  
every  
car  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
looked*  
at  <C-ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
were*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
patient*  
and  
helpful*  
from  
showing*  
the  
cars  <ARG1
to  
doing*  
the  
paperwork  <ARG1
.  

The  
paperwork  >>ARG1
was*  
a  
very  >>ARGM-EXT
easy*  
and  
smooth*  
.  

They  >>ARG0
tried*  
to  
run*  
my  >ARG1
credit  >ARG3
score*  
as  
less  <<ARGM-EXT
as  
possible  
so  
it  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hurt*  
my  >ARG1
score*  
.  

Overall  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
happy*  
with  
the  
customer  >ARG2
service*  
and  
my  >ARG0
purchase*  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
're*  
looking*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
buy*  
a  
car  <ARG1
,  
definitely  >>ARGM-ADV
give*  >ARGM-LVB
them  >ARG1
a  
call*  
.  

They  >ARG0
have*  
a  
huge  
inventory  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
a  
patient  <ARG2
a  
NW  
hospital  
and  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
great*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
had*  
an  
80  
yr  
old  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
take*  
of  <C-ARG1
sent*  
to  
the  
ER  <ARG2
and  
long  >ARGM-TMP
stays*  
in  
the  
hospital  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Yes  
,  
we  >>ARG1
had*  
to  
wait*  
,  
but  
ER  >ARG1
is*  
a  
triage  
system  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
takes*  
the  
most  
life  >ARG2
threatening*  >ARGM-ADJ
cases*  
first  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Any  
ER  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
same  <ARG2
.  

As  
far  >>ARGM-ADV
as  
being*  
treated*  
like  
a  
drug  
seeker  <ARG2
,  
that  >>ARG1
has*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
been*  
my  >ARG0
experience*  
.  

As  
a  
nurse  >ARGM-MNR
I  >ARG0
know*  
about  
drug  
seekers  <ARG1
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
a  
great  
hospital  <ARG2
and  
even  
better  
since  
it  >ARG1
became*  
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
UW  
system  
.  

Wonderful  >ARGM-ADJ
Experience*  

I  >ARG0
had*  
immense  
pain  <ARG1
on  
a  
Sunday  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
,  
with  
friends  >ARG0
and  
family  
telling*  
me  <ARG2
that  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
find*  
a  
Dentist  <ARG1
on  
a  
Sunday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Dr.  >>ARG0
Taylor  
was*  
not  
only  
available*  
on  
a  
Sunday  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
also  >>ARGM-ADV
was*  
able*  
to  
immediately  >>ARGM-TMP
take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
me  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
was*  
incredibly  
informative  <ARG2
about  
the  
options  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
had*  
,  
giving*  
me  <ARG2
opinions  <ARG1
on  
different  >ARGM-ADJ
treatments*  >ARG2
to  
choose*  
from  <C-ARG2

Coming*  >>ARGM-ADV
from  
a  
person  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
hates*  
the  
dentist  <ARG1
in  
general  <ARGM-ADV
,  
Dr.  >ARG1
Taylor  
was*  
the  
best  <ARG2
!  

He  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
made*  
the  
visit*  
a  
pain  
free  
one  <<ARG1
with  
excellent  >ARGM-ADJ

!  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD

him  <ARG1
to  
everyone  <ARG2

HORRIBLE  

This  
school  >ARG1
is*  
the  
worst  
one  >>ARG2

've*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP

I  >ARG0
attended*  
it  <ARG1
for  
2  
years  <ARGM-TMP

and  
that  >>ARG1
was*  
enough*

There  
's*  
holes  <ARG1
everywhere  
in  
the  
ceiling  
,  
sewage  >ARG1
constantly  >ARGM-TMP
leaks*  
through  
the  
ceiling  <ARGM-DIR
,  
and  
the  
whole  
condition  >>ARG1
of  
the  
school  
is*  
horrible*  
.  

The  
staff  >ARG1
and  
the  
Principal  
are*  
rediculous  <ARG2
,  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
listen*  
to  
any  
input*  
,  
and  
they  >ARG0
make*  
up  
rediculous  >ARGM-ADJ
rules*  
(  
They  >ARG0
banned*  
backpacks  <ARG1

because  
a  
teacher  >ARG0
TRIPPED*  
OVER  
a  
student  <ARG1

society  <ARG2
a  
favor  <ARG1
,  
and  
do*  
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
send*  
your  
student  <ARG1
here  <ARG4
.  

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
customer  >ARG2
service*  
and  
quality  >ARGM-ADJ
work*  
.  

They  >>ARG0
went*  
the  
extra  
mile  <ARG1
to  
repair*  
my  
cowboy  
boots  <ARG1
--  
they  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
have*  
a  
special  
kind  >ARG0
of  
paper  
that  >R-ARG0
looked*  
like  
wood  
grain  <ARG1
to  
fix*  
the  
heels  <ARG1
.  

That  >ARG1
was*  
4  
years  
ago  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
been*  
able*  
to  
find*  
a  
shoe  >ARG1
repair*  
place  >>ARG0
in  
Seattle  
since  <<ARGM-TMP
that  >>R-ARG0
has*  
been*  
able*  
to  
do*  
it  <ARG1
.  

(  
I  >>ARG1
've*  
been*  
through  
at  
least  
5  
places  <ARG2
already  <ARGM-TMP
.  
)  

If  
I  >ARG0
had*  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
drive*  
to  
Tacoma  <ARGM-GOL
before  
they  >ARG1
closed*  
during  
the  
work  
week  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  
would  
just  
so  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
those  
boots  >ARG1
fixed*  
properly  <ARGM-MNR
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

So  >ARGM-EXT
Handy*  
for  
Local  
La  
Jolla  
Stuff  
-  
Especially  
for  
Finding*  
Residential  
Numbers  <ARG1

Since  
moving*  >>ARGM-TMP
back  <ARGM-DIR
from  
college  <ARGM-DIR
and  
trying*  
to  
settle*  
roots  <ARG1
in  
the  
Village  
,  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
referred*  
to  
the  
La  
Jolla  
Blue  
Book  <ARG1
for  
a  
ton  <ARG2
of  
local  
numbers  
.  

The  
white  
pages  >ARG0
allowed*  
me  >ARG1
to  
get*  
in  
touch*  
with  
parents  <ARG1
of  
my  
high  
school  
friends  
so  
that  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
track*  
people  <ARG1
down  <C-V
one  <ARGM-MNR
by  
one  
and  
the  
restaurant  
section  >ARG1
is*  
basically  <ARGM-ADV
my  
cookbook  <ARG2
.  

It  
's*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
cool*  
that  
so  
many  
local  
businesses  >>ARG1
are*  
found*  
so  
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
in  
one  
place  <ARGM-LOC
and  
I  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
spread*  
the  
word  <ARG1
.  

THX  
:-)  

The  
staff  >>ARG0
do*  
occasionally  >ARGM-TMP
get*  
game  
info  >ARG1
correct*  
,  
but  
if  
you  >>ARG1
r*  
looking*  >>ARGM-ADV
fot  
a  
good  
game  <ARG1
and  
are*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
a  
nerd  <ARG2
,  
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
ask*  
them  <ARG2
.  

The  
last  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
did*  
that  <ARG1
I  >>ARG0
was*  
suggested*  
to  
buy*  
oblivion  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
told*  
them  <ARG2
I  >>ARG0
was*  
looking*  
for  
a  
fps  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
knew*  
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
was*  
and  
told*  
the  
guy  <ARG2
that  
it  >ARG1
was*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
a  
fps  <ARG2
.  

He  >>ARG0
tried*  
to  
tell*  
me  <ARG2
it  >ARG1
was*  
when  
I  >>ARG0
told*  
asked*  
him  <ARG2
if  
he  >ARG0
knew*  
what  >ARG1
fps  >ARG0
stood*  
for  <C-ARG1
and  
he  >ARG0
had*  
no  
clue  <ARG1
.  

Overall  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG1
are*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
very  
knowledge  <ARG2
about  
the  
type  
of  
games  >ARG1
are*  
on  
the  
market  <ARG2
.  

First  
and  
Last  
time  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
eat*  
there  <ARGM-LOC

My  
friend  >ARG0
and  
I  
went*  
there  <ARG4
for  
lunch  <ARGM-PRP
today  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Neither  
one  >>ARG1
of  
us  
had*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
been*  
-  
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
thought*  
we  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
try*  
it  <ARG1
.  

BIG  >ARGM-ADJ
MISTAKE*  
-  
The  
food  >>ARG1
was*  
tasteless  <ARG2
and  
cold*  
.  

We  >>ARG0
both  
kept*  
trying*  
to  
find*  
something  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
liked*  
.  

The  
only  
thing  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
found*  
edible  <ARG1
were*  
the  
potato  
wedges  <ARG2
,  
I  >ARG0
finally  >ARGM-TMP
gave*  
up  
,  
he  >>ARG0
kept*  
trying*  
-  
he  >ARG0
found*  
the  
fried  
wantons  >ARG1
to  
be*  
OK  <ARG2
-  
His  
Mongolian  
bowl  >>ARG1
was*  
awful*  
.  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
recommend*  
this  
place  <ARG1
to  
anyone  <ARG2
-  
in  
fact  >>ARGM-ADV
-  
save*  
your  
money  <ARG1
and  
go*  
somewhere  <ARG4
else  
.  

Liquidweb.com  >ARG0
Rocks*  
!!!  

I  >ARG1
am*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
client  <ARG2
of  
liquidweb.com  
,  
but  
one  >>ARG1
of  
my  
friend  
called*  
Steven  <ARG2
is*  
the  
client  >ARG0
having*  
several  
websites  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
work*  
with  
him  <ARG3
and  
since  
past  
6  
years  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
is*  
hosting*  
his  
websites  <ARG1
to  
Liquidweb  <ARGM-GOL
.  

As  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
gone*  >>ARGM-ADV
through  
many  
reviews  
sites  <ARG1
to  
see*  
if  
any  
provider  >>ARG0
is*  
providing*  
better  >ARGM-ADJ
services*  
or  
not  
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
realized*  
that  
there  
were*  
many  >ARGM-ADJ
good  >ARGM-ADJ
reviews*  
about  
Liquidweb  <ARG1
also  >ARGM-ADV
Steven  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
faced*  
any  
server  >ARG0
issues*  
in  
his  
whole  
hosting  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
kind  >>ARG1
of  
support*  
they  >ARG0
provide*  
is*  
simply  >ARGM-ADV
great*  
!!!  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
host*  
my  
upcoming  
website  <ARG1
to  
Liquidweb.com  <ARGM-GOL

ever  >ARGM-TMP
eaten*  
(  
and  
I  >>ARG0
've*  
eaten*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
)  
.  

The  
antipasti  >>ARG0
were*  
amazing*  
,  
the  
wines  >ARG1
were*  
mind  
-  
blowing  <ARG2
,  
the  
service*  >>ARG1

Great  >ARGM-ADJ

(  
once  <ARGM-TMP
for  
an

again  
for  
an

their

Top  
notch  
,  
all  >ARGM-EXT
the  
way*  
!  

David  >>ARG0
is*  
amazing*  

David  >ARG1
is*  
the  
most  
helpful  
and  
creative  
photographer  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
used*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
is*  
willing*  
to  
do*  
whatever  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
need*  
from  
him  <ARGM-ADV
without  
hesitation*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
was*  
patient*  
and  
adapted*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
everything  >>ARG1
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
according  
to  
schedule  <ARGM-MNR
on  
my  
wedding  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Both  
the  
engagement*  
and  
wedding*  
pictures  >>ARG0
that  
he  
took  
for  
us  
we*  
absolutely  >ARGM-ADV
amazing*  
.  

He  >ARG0
got*  
the  
pictures  <ARG1
back  
to  
me  <ARG4
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
David  <ARG1
to  
anyone  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
exceed*  
your  >ARG0
expectations*  
!  

He  >>ARG0
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADV
take*  
pictures  <ARG1
he  >ARG0
makes*  
art  <ARG1
out  
of  
them  <ARG2
and  
you  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
notice*  
that  
there  
's*  
a  
camera  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Not  
so  
great  

My  
husband  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
got*  
a  
bike  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
as  
a  
gift  <ARGM-PRD
he  >>ARG0
's*  
only  >ARGM-ADV
had*  
it  <ARG1
a  
month  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
a  
nice  
bike  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
cost*  
a  
lot  <ARG2
of  
money  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
just  
this  
week  >ARGM-TMP
a  
peddle  >ARG1
broke*  
.  

He  >ARG0
took*  
it  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
and  
they  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
honor*  
a  
warranty  <ARG1
and  
said*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
his  >ARG1
fault*  
because  
of  
his  
shoes  <<ARGM-CAU
??  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG0
were*  
going*  
to  
charge*  
him  <ARG2
for  
new  
peddles  <ARG3
and  
proceeded*  
to  
put*  
them  <ARG1
on  <ARG2
without  
even  >ARGM-ADV
telling*  
him  <ARG2
the  
price*  
.  

Which  >>ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
expensive*  
.  

He  >ARG0
asked*  
for  
a  
different  
pair  <ARG1
instead  <ARGM-ADV
and  
they  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
gave*  
him  <ARG2
five  
dollars  <ARG1
off  
??  

Trek  >>ARG1
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
so  >ARGM-EXT
great*  

Only  
Concerned  
With  
Money  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
getting*  
my  >ARG1
treatments*  
for  
a  
few  
months  <<ARGM-TMP
now  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
have*  
seen*  
some  
results  <ARG1
but  
not  
up  
to  
the  
standards  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG2
was*  
told*  
I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
expect*  
.  

The  
people  >>ARG1
there  
attempt*  
to  
come*  
across  
and  
professional  <ARG3
and  
nice  
,  
but  
I  >ARG1
was*  
disappointed  <ARG2
with  
their  >ARG0
customer  >ARG2
service*  
.  

Never  >ARGM-NEG
miss*  
an  
appointment*  
because  
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
charge*  
you  <ARG2
the  
price*  
of  
a  
treatment*  
,  
even  
if  
you  >ARG0
had*  
an  
emergency  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
pretty  
ridiculous  <ARG2
!  

They  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
squeeze*  
as  
much  <ARG1
as  
they  
can  
from  
you  <ARG2
even  
if  
you  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-TMP
got*  
in  
a  
car  
accident  <ARG2
!!!!  

They  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
care*  
one  
bit  <ARGM-EXT
about  
you  <ARG1
!!!!!  

Terrible  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
!!!  

Made*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
appointment*  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
have*  
them  >>ARG0
come*  
to  
the  
house  <ARG4
to  
discuss*  
curtain  
options  <ARG1
and  
give*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
estimate*  
.  

They  >ARG0
sent*  
over  <ARGM-DIR
someone  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
said*  
he  >>ARG0
knows*  
nothing  <ARG1
about  
curtains  
and  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
show*  
me  <ARG2
fabric  
options  <ARG1
or  
give*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
estimate*  
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
called*  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
manager  <ARG1
to  
complain*  
,  
she  >ARG0
said*  
she  >ARG0
KNEW*  
the  
guy  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
about  
curtains  <ARG1
and  
that  
the  
usual  
lady  >ARG0
called*  
in  
sick  <ARG1
hours  <ARG1
earlier  <ARGM-TMP
!  

Instead  
of  
rescheduling*  >ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
chose*  
to  
waste*  
my  
time  <ARG1
instead  <ARGM-ADV
.  

So  
what  
was  
the  
point  
of  
the  
appointment*  
!?!  

To  
just  >ARGM-ADV
come*  
over  <ARGM-DIR
and  
hang*  
out  
?!?  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
business  <ARG1
with  
this  
company  
!  

EVER  
!!!  

Internet  
Department  >>ARG0
is*  
rude*  
and  
insulting*

As

This

Rip

Off  <ARG2

I  >>ARG0

have*  
the  
"  
check*  
engine  <ARG1
"  
light  >ARG1
diagnosed*  
back  
in  
March  <<ARGM-TMP
of  
2010  
.  

They  >ARG0
said*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
"  
plugs  <ARG2

wires  
"  
and  
quoted*  
me  <ARGM-GOL

330  
to  
do*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
work*  
,  
including  
parts  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

I  >ARG0
asked*  
why  
so  
high  <ARG1
and  
they  >ARG0
said*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
due  
to  
the  
labor*  
of  
moving*  
things  <ARG1
out  
of  
the  
way*  
.  

Those  
things  >>ARG1
ended*  
up  
being*  
a  
windsheild  
washer  
fluid  
tank  <ARG2
(  
1

and  
the  
air

I  >>ARG0
did*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
work*  
myself  <ARGM-REC
for  
$  <ARGM-PRP

.  

There  
's*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
excuse*  
for  
that  
kind  <ARG1

estimate*  
.  

My  
girlfriend  >>ARG0
and  
I  
took*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
chance*  
on  
this

we  >>ARG1

seasoned*  
perfectly  <ARGM-MNR

The  
portions  >>ARG2
were*  
generous*  
and  
we  >ARG1
got*  
out  <ARGM-PRD

less  <ARGM-ADV

Fantastic

It  >ARG1
's*  
only  
$  <ARG2

and  
in  
essence  
just  
one  
big  
petting  
zoo  
.  

They  >ARG0
sell*  
feed  <ARG1
and  
milk  
bottles  
at  
the  
front  <ARGM-LOC
and  
I  >ARG0
recommend*  
you  >ARG0
buy*  
lots  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
took*  
our  
7  
month  <ARG1
old  
and  
she  >>ARG0
laughed*  
and  
giggled*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP

very  
harshly  >ARG1

)  
grabbing*

'  
kissed*  
'  
the  
goats  <ARG1

all  >ARGM-ADV

patient*

her  <ARG2

Among  
the  
animals  >>ARG2
that  >>R-ARG0

available*  
to

were*  
pony's  <ARG1

EVEN

almost  
4  
years  <ARGM-TMP

punctual  
,

very  >ARGM-EXT
enthusiastic*  
about  
her  
job  <ARG0

You  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
give*  
her  <ARG2
a  
try  <ARG1
-  
it  
's*  
worth*  
every  
penny  <ARG2
to  
know*  
that  
you

in  
GREAT  
hands  <ARG2

The  
employees  >>ARG1
constantly  >>ARGM-TMP
talk*  
down  <ARGM-MNR
to  
customers  <ARG2

are*  
very  
argumentative  <ARG2

the

business  <ARG3

4  
)  
The  
business  >ARG1
is*  
very  
unorganized  <ARG2
.  

The  
invoice  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
detailed  <ARG2
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
it  
is*  
difficult*  
to  
see*  
what  >>ARG3
you  >>ARG0

paying*  
for  <C-ARG3
.  

I  >>ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
to  
save*  
your  
time  <ARG1
and  
energy  
and  
find*  
another  
greek  
store  <ARG1

the  
best  <ARG2

the  
longest  >ARGM-EXT

and  
most  
authentic  
punk  
store  <ARG1

I  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
shopping*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
for  
over  
six  
years  <ARGM-TMP
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
staff  >>ARG0
is*  
incredibly  >>ARGM-ADV
friendly*  
and  
helpful*  
and  
the  
owner  >ARG1
,  
Mimmy  
,  
is*  
an  
absolute  
angel  <ARG2
.  

The  
mark*  
up  >>ARG1
is*  
minimal*  
considering*  
that  
the  
clothing  >>ARG1
is*  
hard  <ARG2
to  
find*  
and  
often  >ARGM-TMP
shipped*  
for  
Europe  <ARG2
.  

In  
addition*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
clothing  >ARG1
is*  
of  
much  
better  
quality  <ARG2
than  
the  
clothing  >>ARG1
from  
hot  
topic

which  >>R-ARG1

Over-rated  

Buddakan  >ARG0
inevitably  >ARGM-ADV
attracts*  
the  
majority  <ARG1
of  
its  
guests  
simply  
because  
of  
its  >ARG1
association*  
with  
Steven  <ARG2
Starr  
,  
but  
that  >>ARG0
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
impress*  
me  <ARG1
.  

The  
atmosphere  >ARG0
alone  >ARGM-ADV
deserves*  
4  
stars  <ARG1
but  
,  
the  
food  >ARG1
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
up  
to  
par  <ARG2
with  
the  
price  >ARG2
tag*  
and  
the  
reputation  >ARG1
the  
restaurant  >ARG0
carries*  
.  

The  
server  >>ARG0
we  >ARG0
had*  
was*  
knowledgeable*  
but  
he  >>ARG0
was*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
as  >ARGM-CXN
proper*  
as  
he  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
,  
acting*  
like  
he  >>ARG0
was*  
talking*  
to  
his  
friends  <ARG2
rather  
than  
his  
customers  
.  

The  
angry  
lobster  >ARG1
was*  
completely  
over-priced  <ARG2
!  

$  
80  
for  
a  
dish  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
has*  
about  
one  
small  
lobster  
tail  <ARG1
and  
is*  
full*  
of  
filler  
vegetables  <ARG2
!  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
there  <ARG4
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Alto  >ARG0
delivers*  
on  
all  
levels  <ARGM-ADV

From  
the  
moment  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
enter*  
the  
restaurant  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
know*  
you  >ARG1
are*  
some  
place  <ARG2
special  
.  

The  
service*  >ARG1
is*  
impeccable  <ARG2
,  
and  
the  
food  >>ARG1
is*  
even  >ARGM-EXT
better*  
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
the  
four  
-  
course  
tasting  
menu  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
gives*  
you  <ARG2
plenty  <ARG1

The  
landlord  >>ARG0
is*  
not  >>ARGM-NEG
nice*  
nor  
helpful*  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
lived*  
in  
Buckingham  
Condominiums  
townhouse  <ARGM-LOC
for  
2  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
love*  
the  
location  <ARG1
and  
the  
apartment  
!!  

I  >ARG1
'm*  
a  
single  
female  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG1
feel*  
safe*  
coming*  
home  <ARG4
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
maintenance  
people  >>ARG0
are*  
AWESOME*  
!!!!  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
exterminator  >>ARG1
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
nice*  
,  
also  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-ADV
have*  
a  
few  
bugs  <ARG1
,  
but  
that  >>ARG1
's*  
going*  
to  
be*  
anywhere  >ARG4
you  >ARG0
go*  
!  

The  
only  
problem  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
experienced*  
is*  
the  
landlord  <ARG2
.  

She  >ARG1
is*  
a  
pure  
b****  <ARG2
!!!  

I  >ARG0
know*  
that  >ARG1
's*  
ugly  <ARG2
...  
but  
she  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
help*  
you  <ARG2
out  <C-V
for  
anything  <ARGM-ADV
...  
sad  
story  
.  

Other  
than  
that  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
living*  
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  
:)  

The  
staff  >ARG0
leaves*  
a  
lot  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
desired*  
.  

The  
front  
staff  >>ARG1
has*  
seen*  
quite  
a  
bit  <ARG1
of  
turnover*  
and  
changed*  
from  
professional  <ARG3
to  
rude  <ARG2
.  

A  
simple  >ARGM-ADJ
follow  >ARGM-PRP
-  
up  
phone  >ARGM-MNR
call*  >ARG1
with  
a  
woman  <ARG1
quickly  >ARGM-MNR
turned*  
into  
a  
nightmare  <ARG2
.  

She  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
reason  <ARG2
for  
all  
the  
change*  
.  

I  >ARG0
sincerely  >ARGM-MNR
wonder*  
if  
the  
doctor  >ARG0
has*  
a  
clue  <ARG1
about  
what  >>ARG1
is*  
going*  
on  
within  
his  
practice  <ARGM-LOC
.  

If  
he  >>ARG0
does*  
know*  >>ARGM-ADV
and  
approves*  
of  
this  
behavior  <ARG1
then  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
is*  
a  
poor  >ARGM-MNR
reflection*  
on  
him  <ARG2
.  

Sometimes  >>ARGM-TMP
it  
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
worth*  
it  <ARG2
to  
go*  
through  
that  
kind  <ARG2
of  
staff  
and  
their  
personal  
attitude  
to  
get*  
to  
a  
doctor  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG1
was*  
an  
okay  
doctor  <ARG2
but  
not  
worth  
her  
.

us  >>ARG0

did*

It  >>ARG1

!  

Kathy  >ARG1

the

really  
weird  
place  
,  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
driving*  
home  <ARG1
from  
work*  
thought*  
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
stop*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
for  
an  
oil  >ARG1

and  
well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
there  
are*  
a

guys  >>ARG0
in  
jiffy  
lube

sitting*  
at  
the  
table  <ARG2
drinking*  
beers  <ARG1
and  
shooting*  
the

The

sign  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
said*  
"  
on  <ARG1
"  
yet  
some  
guy  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG1
seemed*  
to  
be*  
the  
oldest  <ARG2
of  
the  
bunch  
,  
more  
like  
the

told*  
me  <ARG2
they  >>ARG1
'd  >>ARGM-MOD

tomorrow  <ARGM-TMP

I  >ARG0
asked*  
if  
a  
manager  >ARG1
was*  
on  
duty  <ARG2
he  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
he  >ARG1

.  

WOW  
!  

grey  
shirt  
"  
mark  
"  
of  >>ARGM-ADV
course  
with  
this  
type  
behavior  >>ARGM-ADV
he  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
wearing*  
someon  
else  
s  
clothing  <ARG1
.....  

A  
friend  >ARG0
and  
I  
recently  >ARGM-TMP
took*  
our  
16  <ARG1
and  
18  
month  
olds  
here  <ARG3
.  

While  
there  
was*  >>ARGM-ADV
n't  <ARGM-NEG
too  
much  <ARG1
available  
for  
their  
age  
(  
ball  
pit  
,  
bouncy  
area  
and  
a  
little  
padded  
pyramid  >ARG1
to  
climb*  
on  <C-ARG1
)  
,  
we  >>ARG1
went*  
right  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
opened*  
at  
10  
am  <ARGM-TMP
on  
a  
winter  
weekday  
and  
ended*  
up  
being*  
the  
only  
ones  <ARG2
there  
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG2
were*  
given*  
a  
little  
more  
liberty  <ARG1
than  
we  
would  
have*  
if  
others  >>ARG1
had*  
been*  
there  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
classiest  
place  <ARG2
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
cleaner*  
than  
I  >ARG0
expected*  
and  
the  
staff  >>ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
friendly*  
.  

For  
$  >ARGM-ADV
4  
it  >ARG1
was*  
a  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
break*  
from  
the  
monotony  <ARG1
of  
winter  
indoors  
with  
a  
toddler  
.  

Restored*  
my  
faith  <ARG1
in  
Mechaincs  
.  

I  >>ARG0
spent*  
3  
months  <ARG1
going*  
from  
shop  <ARG3
to  
shop  <ARG4
trying*  
to  
get*  
my  
Ferrari  >>ARG1
to  
run*  
and  
drive*  
the  
way*  
it  
should  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
about  
to  
give*  
up  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
met*  
Jason  <ARG1
and  
Neal  
.  

They  >ARG0
took*  
on  
the  
challenge*  
of  
making*  
my  
Ferrari  <ARG1
all  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
dreamed*  
of  <C-ARG1
and  
more  
.  

The  
crew  >>ARG0
at  
The  
Creative  
Workshop  
went*  
over  
and  
above  
the  
call*  
of  
duty  <ARG0
and  
gave*  
me  <ARG2
back  <C-V
a  
car  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
drive*  
anywhere  <ARGM-DIR
and  
finally  >ARGM-TMP
enjoy*  
owning*  
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
say*  
enough  <ARG1
about  
this  
place  <ARG3
.  

They  >>ARG0
have*  
restored*  
my  
faith  <ARG1
in  
Mechanics  
.  

Do*  
yourself  <ARG2
a  
favor  <ARG1
,  
call*  
these  
guys  <ARG1
first  <ARGM-TMP
and  
enjoy*  
driving*  
your  
car  <ARG1
again  <<ARGM-TMP
..  

a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
vacation*  
!  

We  >>ARG0
wanted*  
to  
see*  
the  
sun  <ARG1
-  
and  
we  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
got*  
much  
more  <ARG1
!  

Excellent  
chefs  >>ARG0
are*  
in  
the  
kitchen  <ARG2
preparing*  
memorable  
breakfasts  <ARG1
.  

After  
a  
train  >ARG1
ride*  >ARGM-TMP
over  
the  
mountains  <ARGM-DIR
,  
we  >ARG0
enjoyed*  
hiking*  
in  
the  
flower  
-  
filled  
Wenatchee  
hills  <ARG1
(  
in  
May  <ARGM-TMP
)  
and  
a  
very  
interesting  >ARGM-ADJ
bike  >ARG1
ride*  
in  
a  
loop  <ARGM-LOC
around  
the  
Columbia  
River  
...  
and  
then  
wine  
if  
we  >ARG0
wanted*  
it  <ARG1
on  
the  
patio  
in  
the  
evening  
....  

This  >ARG1
is*  
a  
busy  
group  <ARG2
of  
hosts  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
running*  
a  
restaurant  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
also  >>ARGM-DIS
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
wonderful*  
-  
so  >ARGM-ADV
just  >ARGM-ADV
ask*  
for  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
need*  
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
sure*  
they  >>ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
their  
best  <ARG1
to  
be*  
hospitable  <ARG2
.  

OMG  

OMG  >ARGM-DIS
..  
make*  
sure*  
to  
book*  
a  
reservation*  
,  
as  
this  
magical  
place  >ARG1
is*  
packed  <ARG2
(  
in  
a  
nice  >ARGM-MNR
way*  
)  
I  >ARG0
love*  
that  
the  
owner  >>ARG0
walks*  
around  <ARG2
and  
cares*  
how  >ARG1
his  
customers  >ARG0
feel*  
about  
their  
food  <ARG2
.  

The  
waiters  >ARG1
are*  
like  
no  
other  <ARG2
...  

My  
waiter  >>ARG1
was*  
so  >ARGM-ADV
excellent*  
I  >ARG0
gave*  
him  <ARG2
a  
75  
%  >ARG1
tip*  
,  
and  
it  >ARG1
was*  
worht  <ARG2
every  
penny  
..  

The  
food  >>ARG1
was*  
finger  >ARGM-MNR
licking*  >ARGM-EXT
the  
bowel  <ARG1
fantastic*  
..  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
discovered*  
her  >ARG0
has*  
a  
place  <ARG1
right  
near  
my  >ARG0
work*  
(  
Color*  
me  >ARG1
Phat*  
)  
If  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
looking*  >>ARGM-ADV
for  
a  
romatic  
place  <ARG1
with  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
food  
and  
service*  
in  
the  
valley  <ARGM-LOC
Giovanni  >ARG1
Ristorante  
should  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
your  >ARG0
number  >ARG1
1  
+  
2  
choice*  
.  

Holly  >ARG1
is*  
truely  <ARGM-ADV
the  
best  
hairstylist  <ARG2
!  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
lived*  
in  
the  
UTC  
La  
Jolla  
area  <ARGM-LOC
for  
many  
years  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
I  
never  
new  
this  
salon  >ARG1
was*  
here  <ARG2
until  
a  
friend  >ARG0
reffered*  
me  >ARG0
to  
see*  
Holly  <ARG1
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
pleased*  
with  
my  >ARG0
experience*  
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

All  >>ARG1
of  
the  
people  
were*  
friendly*  
and  
welcoming  
.  

I  >ARG0
got*  
highlights  <ARG1
,  
haircut  
,  
and  
a  
blowdry  
.  

She  >ARG0
did*  
a  
great  
job  <ARG1
!  

Holly  >ARG1
is*  
very  
experienced  <ARG2
and  
talented  
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
tell*  
she  
new  <ARG1
what  >>ARG1
she  >>ARG0
was*  
doing*  
right  
off  
the  
bat  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

My  
hair  >>ARG0
looks*  
amazing*  
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
get*  
compliments  <ARG1
all  
the  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
deffenitly  >ARGM-ADV
reccomend*  
this  
salon  <ARG1
and  
Holly  
to  
anyone  <ARG2
.  

You  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
disappointed*  
!!!!!!  

Outdated  
but  
not  
bad  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-EXT
felt*  
like  
this  
place  >ARG1
was*  
extremely  
outdated  <ARG2
especially  
since  
the  
pictures  >ARG0
make*  
it  >>ARG1
look*  
nice*  
and  
modern  
.  

It  >>ARG0
had*  
listed*  
that  
there  
was*  
a  
hot  
breakfast  <ARG1
but  
all  >>ARG1
this  >ARG1
meant*  
is*  
that  
they  >ARG0
added*  
a  
waffle  
maker  <ARG1
to  
the  
common  
continental  
affair  <ARG2
at  
most  
cheap  
hotels  
.  

The  
family  
suite  >ARG1
was*  
basically  <ARGM-ADV
two  
rooms  >>ARG1
with  
a  
small  >ARGM-ADJ
opening*  
between  
them  <ARGM-LOC
which  >R-ARG1
worked*  
great  <ARGM-MNR
for  
us  <ARG2
because  
we  >ARG1
were*  
two  
families  >ARG0
traveling*  
together  <ARGM-MNR
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
in  
town  >>ARGM-ADV
and  
need*  
that  
kind  <ARG1
of  
space  
I  >ARG0
say*  
stay*  
here  <ARG3
but  
if  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
looking*  >>ARGM-ADV
for  
a  
little  
more  
upscale  
affair  <ARG1
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
let*  
the  
pictures  >ARG0
fool*  
you  <ARG1
and  
book*  
somewhere  <ARGM-LOC
else  
.  

Great  
,  
and  
probably  
the  
only  
West  
Indian  
spot  
worth  
hitting*  
up  
in  
Nashville  
.  

I  >>ARG1
was*  
born*  
and  
raised*  
in  
Toronto  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
has*  
a  
huge  >ARGM-ADJ
West  
Indian  >ARG2
(  
Trinidadian  
,  
Jamaican  
,  
etc  
)  
population*  
.  

So  
huge  
in  
fact  
,  
that  
Toronto  
slang  >>ARG0
is*  
influenced*  
by  <ARG0
and  
has*  
Jamaican  >ARGM-ADJ
references*  
,  
and  
Jamaican  
beef  
patties  >ARG1
are*  
staples  <ARG2
in  
my  
high  
school  
cafeteria  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Anyway  
,  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
practically  >ARGM-ADV
raised*  
on  
this  
stuff  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
being*  
a  
connoisseur  >ARGM-ADV
of  
West  
Indian  
cuisine  
,  
Jamaica  
Way  >ARG1
is*  
a  
bit  >ARGM-EXT
toned*  
down  
to  
suit*  
the  
American  
palette  <ARG2
.  

All  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
do*  
to  
make*  
it  <ARG1
authentic  
Jamaican  
food  <ARG1
,  
is*  
add*  
a  
whole  
lot  <ARG1
of  
pepper  
.  

A

ever  >ARGM-TMP
seen*  
.  

I  >ARG0
felt*  
like  
I  >ARG1
was*  
in  
heaven  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
walked*  
through  
the  
majestic  
fields  <ARG2
of  
this  
particular  
farm  
.  

The  
trees  >ARG1
were*  
in  
magnificent  >ARGM-ADJ
shape*  
and  
the  
variety  >>ARG0
was*  
astounding*  
.  

The  
owners  >>ARG0
were*  
entertaining  <ARG2
and  
gracious*  
.  

I  >ARG0
especially  >ARGM-EXT
liked*  
the  
Eco  
friendly  
atmosphere  <ARG1
and  
the  
owner  >ARG0
s  
love*  
of  
all  
animals  <ARG1
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
best  
farms  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG1
have*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
been*  
too  <C-ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
call*  
it  <ARG1
the  
Taj  
Mahal  <ARG2
of  
the  
east  
coast  
!  

It  >ARG0
put*  
hair  <ARG1
on  
my  
chest  <ARG2
and  
thanks*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
the  
owner  
s  
advice  <ARG1
I  >>ARG1
invested*  
vanguard  <ARG2
,  
got*  
myself  <ARG4
a  
woman  <ARG1
like  
Jerry  
,  
and  
became*  
a  
republican  <ARG2

Pho  
-  
nomenal  
!!  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
eating*  
Pho  <ARG1
for  
almost  
my  
entire  
life  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >>ARG0
've*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
gone*  
to  
the  
Pho  
places  <ARG4
in  
south  
philly  
and  
off  
the  
boulevard  
and  
even  
the  
other  
one  
in  
chinatown  
,  
but  
when  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
tried*  >ARGM-TMP
this  
pho  
place  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG0
blew*  
the  
other  
pho  
houses  <ARG1
away  <ARGM-DIR
!!  

all  >ARG1
of  
the  
pho  
places  
taste*  
the  
same  <ARG2
to  
me  <ARGM-GOL
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
what  >>ARG1
seperates*  
one  <ARG1
from  
the  
other  <ARG2
is*  
the  
service*  
and  
the  
price*  
.  

The  
service*  >ARG1
here  <ARGM-LOC
is*  
incredible  <ARG2
compared  
to  
the  
other  
places  <ARGM-ADV
.  

the  
only  
down  
fall  >ARG1
of  
this  
pho  
house  
is*  
the  
difficulty  <ARG2
in  
finding*  
parking*  
in  
chinatown  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

remember*  
to  
bring*  
cash  <ARG1
since  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
take*  
debit  <ARG1
or  
credit  
.  

hope*  
this  >ARG0
helps*  
!!  

Had*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
horrible  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
with  
a  
manager  <ARG1
here  
,  
Rachel  
McInnis  
,  
she  >>ARG0
was*  
rude*  
,  
inconsiderate  
and  
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
the  
right  
thing  <ARG1
for  
an  
item  >>ARG2
that  >>R-ARG2
was*  
marked*  
incorrectly  <ARGM-MNR
...  

I  >>ARG1
'm*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
interested*  
in  
shopping*  
in  
a  
place  <ARGM-LOC
with  
people  
like  
her  
...  
she  >>ARG0
refused*  
to  
sell*  
me  <ARG2
the  
item  <ARG1
at  
its  >ARG1
marked  >ARGM-PRD
price*  
even  
after  
admitting*  
they  >>ARG0
had*  
made*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
mistake*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
normally  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
write*  
reviews*  
but  
seeing*  >>ARGM-ADV
that  
I  >ARG0
considered*  
Dillards  <ARG1
a  
distinguished  
,  
upscale  
place  >ARG2
to  
shop*  
,  
this  
one  >>ARG0
wo  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
getting*  
my  
business  <ARG1
,  
nor  
my  
family  
's  
,  
nor  
my  
co-workers  
.  

It  
's*  
never  <ARGM-NEG
ok  <ARG2
to  
let*  
a  
customer  >>ARG1
walk*  
out  <ARG2
unhappy*  
,  
especially  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG1
are*  
right*  
.  

Highly  >ARGM-EXT
Recommend*  

I  >ARG0
work*  
as  
a  
Transformational  
Life  
Coach  <ARG1
.  

Since  
this  >ARG1
is*  
an  
alternative  
therapy  >ARGM-CAU
I  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
refer*  
clients  <ARG1
to  
a  
lisenced  
therapist  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
feel*  
that  >>ARG1
is*  
appropriate*  
.  

I  >ARG0
found*  
her  <ARG1
through  
a  
colleague  <ARGM-MNR
one  
day  <ARGM-TMP
when  >>ARGM-TMP
one  >>ARG0
of  
my  
clients  
was*  
in  
the  
midst  <ARG2
of  
a  
panic  >ARGM-MNR
attack*  
and  
needed*  
professional  >ARG1
help*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
am*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
qualified  <ARG2
to  
provide*  
.  

Little  >ARGM-ADV
did  
I  >ARG0
know*  
that  
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
soon  >>ARGM-TMP
be*  
needing*  
her  >ARG0
help*  
as  <<ARGM-ADV
well  
!  

She  >ARG0
guided*  
me  <ARG1
through  
a  
very  
difficult  
period  >ARGM-TMP
dealing*  
with  
a  
family  
member  
's  
suicide  >ARG1
,  
coupled*  
with  
elder  >ARG1
abuse*  
.  

I  >ARG0
found*  
her  >>ARG0
to  
be*  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
solid*  
,  
kind*  
,  
compassionate  
,  
and  
intuitive  
as  
well  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
her  <ARG1
highly  <ARGM-EXT
!  

They  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
a  
second  >ARGM-TMP
chance*  
from  
me  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

First  >ARGM-TMP
,  
let*  
me  >ARG0
state*  
that  
although  
I  >ARG0
live*  >ARGM-ADV
in  
NYC  <ARGM-LOC
,  
I  >ARG1
am*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
from  
NYC  <ARG2
,  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
care*  
about  
baseball  <ARG1
and  
I  >ARG0
absolutely  >ARGM-EXT
love*  
Boston  <ARG1
to  
death*  
(  
so  
beautiful  
,  
so  
clean  
,  
so  
awesome  
)  
.  

That  >ARG1
said*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
hated*  
this  
restaurant  <ARG1
.  

The  
service*  >>ARG1
was*  
just  
about  >ARGM-ADV
as  >ARGM-CXN
good*  
as  
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
in  
NYC  <ARGM-LOC
(  
that  >ARG1
means*  
it  >>ARG2
was*  
poor*  
)  
and  
the  
food  >ARG1
was*  
almost  
mediocre  <ARG2
.  

The  
decor  >ARG0
left*  
a  
lot  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
desired*  
and  
the  
posters  >>ARG0
telling*  
me  <ARG2
all  
the  
reasons  >>ARGM-CAU
99  >>ARG1
was*  
great*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
served*  
as  
an  
ironic  >ARGM-ADJ
contrast*  
against  
the  
reality  <ARG2
.  

Personally  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
recommend*  
you  >ARG0
take*  
your  
money  <ARG1
elsewhere  <ARG3

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
arrived*  
at  
Brickell  
Honda  <ARG4
on  
6/4/11  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
greeted*  
and  
attended*  
to  <C-ARG1
by  
the  
Sales  
Manager  <ARG0
,  
Gustavo  
Guerra  
,  
in  
a  
very  
friendly  
and  
professional  
manner  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
explained*  
to  
him  <ARG2
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
wanted*  
and  
that  
I  >ARG0
previously  >ARGM-TMP
went*  
to  
Braman  
Honda  <ARG4
.  

Bramen  
Honda  >ARG1
was*  
a  
bit  <ARG2
of  
a  
hassle*  
.  

He  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
"  
no  
problem  <ARG1
,  
we  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
match*  
the  
offer*  
or  
do*  
better  <ARGM-MNR
.  
"  

Mr.  >ARG0
Guerra  
gave*  
me  <ARG2
a  
better  >ARGM-ADJ
deal*  
without  
any  
hassles*  
nor  
any  
type  
of  
problems  
.  

Brickell  
Honda  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
buying  >ARG1
experience*  
in  
the  
world  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
urge*  
all  
St.  
Thomas  
the  
Apostle  
parishioners  <ARG1
and  
all  
of  
South  
Florida  
residents  
to  
come*  
see*  
Gus  <ARG1
!!!  

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
customer  >ARG2
service*  
!!!  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
,  
Honest  >ARGM-MNR
Service*  

I  >>ARG0
took*  
my  
2001  
Nissan  
Frontier  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
to  
fix*  
a  
cracked  
manifold  <ARG1
.  

The  
dealer  >ARG0
wanted*  
$  >ARGM-ADV
1300  
to  
fix*  
that  <ARG1
and  
another  
$  >ARGM-ADV
1500  
to  
fix*  
some  
other  
things  <ARG1
.  

Eagle  
Transmission  >ARG0
determined*  
that  
much  >>ARG1
of  
the  
work*  >>ARG1
the  
dealer  >ARG0
said*  
needed*  
to  
be*  
done*  
was*  
unneccesary  <ARG2
and  
what  >>ARG1
needed*  
to  
be*  
fixed*  
was*  
only  
$  <ARG2
400  
!!  

I  >>ARG1
was*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
impressed*  
with  
the  
honesty  <ARG0
and  
integrity  
of  
Mike  
and  
everyone  
at  
Eagle  
Transmission  
!  

I  >ARG0
dropped*  
the  
truck  <ARG1
off  <C-V
in  
the  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
and  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
ready*  
that  
afternoon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
finally  >ARGM-TMP
found*  
a  
mechanic  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
trust*  
!!  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
it  
was*  
great*  
that  
they  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
charge*  
a  
service  
fee  <ARG1
to  
diagnose*  
the  
problem  <ARG2
-  
an  
added  
bonus  
!!  

Dr.  
Shady  

Kelly  >ARG0
hit*  
the  
nail  <ARG1
on  
the  
head  <ARGM-LOC

"  
Dr.  >ARG1
Shady  
"  
is*  
a  
jerk  <ARG2
.  

After  
the  
way*  >>ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG0
spoke*  
to  
me  <ARG2
on  
my  >ARG0
last  >ARGM-TMP
visit*  
,  
I  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
returning*  
!!  

Good  
luck  
keeping*  
business  <ARG1
with  
that  
stuck*  
up  
attitude  <ARG0
Dr.  
Shady  
.  

You  >>ARG3
have*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
lost*  
mine  <ARG1
.  

The  
next  
time  >ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG1
feel*  
like  
being*  
condescending  <ARG2
to  
someone  <ARGM-GOL
,  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
not  
going*  
to  
be*  
me  <ARG2
!!!!!!  

Dr.  >ARG1
Shady  
is*  
inexperienced  <ARG2
and  
prideful  
.  

She  >>ARG0
probably  >>ARGM-ADV
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
have*  
10  
%  <ARG1
of  
the  
knowledge  
that  
some  
of  
the  
other  
EXPERIENCED  
vets  
do*  
in  
this  
area  
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
carefully  >ARGM-MNR
researching*  
vets  <ARG1
before  
I  >ARG0
take*  
my  
dog  <ARG1
someplace  <ARG3
else  
.  

Beautifully  
written  >ARGM-ADJ
reviews*  
Doctor  
,  
but  
completely  
UNTRUE  
.  

Poor  >ARGM-ADJ
Experience*  

I  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >>ARGM-NEG
have*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
w  
/  
Dr.  <ARG1
Ghassemlou  
.  

During  
the  
session*  >ARGM-TMP
,  
he  >>ARG0
demanded*  
to  
have*  
my  
physical  
address  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
've*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
kept*  
private*  
as  
I  >>ARG1
am*  
enrolled*  
in  
a  
witness  >ARG1
protection*  
program  <<ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
believe*  
he  >>ARG1
is*  
correct*  
in  
that  
he  >ARG0
needs*  
my  
physical  
address  <ARG1
for  
legal  
reasons  <ARGM-PRP
,  
however  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
adequately  >ARGM-MNR
explain*  
this  <ARG1
during  
our  >ARG0
session*  
.  

I  >ARG0
learned*  
more  <ARG1
about  
this  
doing*  >ARGM-LVB
my  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-ADJ
research*  
afterward  
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
he  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
've*  
done*  
more  <ARG1
to  
assuage*  
my  >ARG1
concerns*  
by  
giving*  
me  <ARG2
concrete  
facts  <ARG1
.  

Saying*  >>ARG0
that  
I  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
give*  
him  <ARG2
my  
address  <ARG1
or  
else  
I  >>ARG1
have*  >ARGM-LVB
intimacy  >ARG0
issues*  
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
helpful*  
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
pretty  
combative  <ARG2
actually  <ARGM-ADV
.  

you  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
love*  
it  <ARG1

I  >>ARG0
have*  
had*  
my  
back  >ARG1
fused*  
in  
2  
places  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
wish*  
that  
I  >>ARG0
had*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
done*  
this  <ARG1
.  

With  
these  
fusions*  >>ARGM-MNR
,  
chiropractric  >>ARG1
is*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
as  >ARGM-EXT
successful*  
,  
but  
it  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-ADV
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful*  
.  

Even  
after  
my  >ARG1
fusions*  
,  
my  
back  >>ARG1
continued*  
to  
hurt*  
,  
but  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hurt*  
any  
more  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
encourage*  
anyone  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
is*  
thinking*  
of  
back  
surgery  <ARG1
,  
to  
talk*  
about  
different  
treatment  
options  <ARG1
first  <ARGM-TMP
with  
Dr.  <ARG2
de  
Barros  
.  

He  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
knows*  
what  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
is*  
talking*  
about  <C-ARG1
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
approach*  
the  
different  
options  <ARG1
fairly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see*  
different  >ARGM-ADJ
treatments*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
a  
surgeon  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see*  
,  
so  
that  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
several  
treatment  
options  <ARG1
before  
you  >ARG0
decide*  
what  >ARG1
to  
do*  
.  

Unbelievably  
huge  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
for  
such  
a  
small  
salon  <ARGM-ADJ

I  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
to  
Kim  <ARG2
at  
Cheveux  
for  
more  
than  
five  
years  <ARGM-TMP

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
tell*  
you  <ARG2
how  
often  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG1
am*  
complimented*  
on  
my  
hair  <ARG2
(  
style

color

!  

I  >ARG0
regularly  >ARGM-TMP
request*  
Kim

business  
cards  <ARG1
as  
I  >>ARG2
am*  
often  >>ARGM-TMP
stopped*  
on

made*  
to  
feel*  
special*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
am*  
in  
the  
chair  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
NEVER  >>ARGM-NEG
had*  >>ARGM-LVB
a  
less  
than  
amazing  >>ARGM-ADJ
cut*  >ARG1
or  
color  
experience*  
.  

My  
hair  >>ARG2
has*  
never  >>ARGM-NEG
felt*  
this  
healthy*  
,  
either  <ARGM-DIS
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
recommend*  
this  
salon  <ARG1
enough  <ARGM-EXT
!!!  

Thanks*

My  
Favorite  
in  
McLean  

My  
family  >>ARG1
loves*  
coming*  
to  
Endo  
Sushi  <ARG4
.  
They  >>ARG1
are*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
nice*  
,  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
crowded*  
,  
and  
the  
food  >>ARG1
is*  
wonderful*  
,  
very  >ARGM-EXT
delicious*  
and  
fresh*  
!  

Sometimes  >>ARGM-TMP
it  
is*  
hard*  
to  
get*  
parking*  
in  
the  
lot  <<ARGM-LOC
in  
front  
of  
the  
storefront  
,  
and  
it  >ARG1
is*  
on  
a  
one  
-  
way*  
street  <<ARG2
,  
but  
the  
restaurant  >>ARG1
itself  
is*  
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
overcrowded*  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
park*  >>ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
lot  <ARG2
,  
then  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
park*  
in  
the  
shopping  
center  
's  
garage  <ARG2
,  
and  
walk*  
up  <ARG2
to  
Endo  
Sushi  <ARG2
.  

The  
service*  >>ARG1
is*  
fast*  
.  

Be*  
sure*  
to  
ring*  
the  
little  
bell  <ARG1
on  
your  >ARG0
way*  
out  <ARG1
if  
you  >ARG0
enjoyed*  
your  
meal  <ARG1
!  

(  
it  >ARG1
's*  
by  
the  
door  <ARG2
,  
on  
the  
hostess  
stand  
)  

Horrible  >ARGM-ADJ
Service*  
!  

I  >>ARG2
got*  
yelled*  
at  <C-ARG2
,  
literally  >ARGM-ADV
yelled*  
at  <C-ARG2
because  
i  >ARG0
asked*  
if  
i  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
pick*  
up  
my  
car  <ARG1
5  
-  
10  
minutes  
late  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
explained*  
that  
i  >ARG1
was*  
already  <ARGM-TMP
on  
my  >ARG0
way*  
and  
i  >>ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
rush*  
to  
get*  
there  <ARG2
as  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
as  
i  
could  
because  
i  >ARG0
needed*  
my  
car  <ARG1
for  
work*  
at  
5  
am  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
the  
guy  >>ARG0
was*  
arguing*  
with  
me  <ARG1
saying*  
he  >>ARG0
was*  
gon*  
na  
lock*  
the  
doors  <ARG1
right  
at  
5:30  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Rude  
,  
unprofessional  
,  
just  
jerks  
.  

Seems*  
like  
all  >>ARG1
they  >ARG0
care*  
about  <C-ARG1
is*  
the  
money  <ARG2
and  
getting*  
home  <ARG2
on  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
NO  >ARGM-NEG
care*  
for  
the  
customers  <ARG1
AT  
ALL  <ARGM-EXT
!!!  

Missed*  
a  
whole  
day  <ARG1
of  
work*  
because  
i  >ARG1
am*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
carless  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
to  
this  
place  <ARG4
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Superb  >ARGM-ADJ
Arrangements*  

I  >ARG0
used*  
Fancy  
Flowers  <ARG1
for  
my  
late  
husband  
's  
funeral  
flowers  <ARG2
as  
they  >>ARG1
had*  
been*  
recommended*  
to  
me  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG1
am*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
glad*  
that  
I  >>ARG0
called*  
in  
to  
see*  
Ana  <ARG1
,  
she  >ARG1
is*  
a  
lovely  
girl  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
showed*  
nothing  <ARG1
but  
care*  
and  
compassion*  
towards  
me  <ARG1
.  

The  
flowers  >ARG1
were*  
all  >>ARG2
that  >>R-ARG2
I  >ARG0
hoped*  
they  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
,  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
attended*  
several  
funerals  <ARG1
of  
late  <ARGM-TMP
unfortunately  <ARGM-ADV
and  
the  
flowers  >>ARG0
I  >ARG0
recieved*  
from  
Ana  <ARG2
outshone*  
them  <ARG1
all  
.  

She  >ARG1
is*  
so  
talented  <ARG2
,  
the  
flowers  >>ARG1
were*  
arranged*  
superbly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
delicately  
,  
it  
is*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
obvious*  
to  
see*  
the  
difference*  
between  
someone  <ARG1
fully  
trained  
and  
skilled  
compared  
to  
others  
.  

Thank*  
you  <ARG1
Ana  <ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
hope*  
to  
see*  
you  <ARG1
in  
the  
future  <ARGM-TMP
under  
better  
circumstances  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
first  >ARGM-TMP
experience*  
.  

I  >ARG1
'm*  
22  <ARG2
,  
and  
my  
hairdresser  >>ARG1
was*  
great*  
(  
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
"  
old*  
"  
like  
one  >>ARG0
of  
the  
reviews*  
says*  
)  
-  
she  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
listened*  
to  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
wanted*  
and  
gave*  
me  <ARG2
tons  <ARG1
of  
tips*  
on  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
style*  
my  
hair  <ARG1
so  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
it  >ARG0
to  
look*  
the  
way*  
I  >ARG0
wanted*  
it  <ARG1
to  <ARG1
.  

She  >>ARG0
deep  >ARGM-EXT
conditioned*  
my  
hair  <ARG1
and  
took*  
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
style*  
it  <ARG1
properly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

She  >>ARG0
recommended*  
products  <ARG1
but  
absolutely  >>ARGM-ADV
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
pressure*  
me  >ARG0
to  
buy*  
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
a  
cute  
place  <ARG2
with  
a  
really  
friendly  
,  
laid  
-  
back  
atmosphere  
.  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
it  <ARG1
and  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
going*  
back  <ARG4
for  
my  
next  
haircut  <ARGM-PRP
.  

Oh  
!  

And  
students  >ARG0
get*  
$  <ARG1
5  
off  <ARG1
,  
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
argue*  
with  
that  <ARG2
.  

Smoker  
s  
Haven  

Yeah  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
this  
complex  >>ARG1
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
very  >ARGM-EXT
good*  
.  

Our  
bathroom  
fan  >>ARG1
,  
one  
electric  
outlet  
and  
2  
leaky  
sinks  
have*  
yet  <ARG1
to  
be*  
fixed*  
.  

Both  
bathrooms  >ARG0
look*  
like  
they  >>ARG1
were*  
flooded*  
and  
the  
wood  
cabinets  >>ARG1
are*  
thrashed*  
at  
the  
bottom  <ARGM-LOC
and  
they  >>ARG0
slapped*  
some  
pieces  <ARG2
of  
wood  
over  <ARGM-PRD
to  
try*  
to  
cover*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
non-smokers  >ARGM-DIS
beware*  
!!!  

I  >ARG0
think*  
90  
percent  >ARG1
of  
the  
tenants  
are*  
smokers  <ARG2
!  

If  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
smoke*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
move*  
here  <ARG2
.  

Our  
unit  >ARG0
reeks*  
of  
old  
cigarette  
smoke  <ARG1
and  
it  >>ARG1
started*  
to  
become*  
apparent*  
a  
few  
weeks  
after  
we  >ARG1
moved*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
walk*  
5  
feet  <ARG2
without  
smelling*  
that  
disgusting  
cigarette  
smoke  <ARG1
and  
it  >ARG1
blows*  
right  
into  
the  
windows  <ARGM-DIR
all  
day  <ARGM-TMP
and  
all  
night  
.  

Great  
Sanwiches  
,  
Great  >ARGM-ADJ
Prices*  

I  >>ARG0
used*  
to  
go*  
here  <ARG4
almost  
every  
day  <ARGM-TMP
since  
I  >ARG0
work*  
in  
the  
neighbourhood  <ARGM-LOC
and  
loved*  
their  
turkey  
and  
meatball  
sandwiches  <ARG1
.  

Chicken  
salad  
salad  >>ARG1
is*  
great*  
too  <ARGM-DIS
.  

Best  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
all  
,  
the  
staff  >>ARG0
is*  
quick*  
on  
their  
feet  <ARGM-MNR
and  
even  
with  
long  
lines  
,  
usually  >ARGM-TMP
serve*  
you  <ARG2
in  
5  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
or  
less  
.  

For  
the  
quality  
,  
the  
prices*  >>ARG1
(  
$  <ARG2
4  
-  
$  
6  
)  
have*  
to  
be*  
the  
best  <ARG2
in  
town  
.  

The  
staff  >>ARG0
get*  
to  
know*  
regulars  <ARG1
and  
do*  
their  
job  <ARG1
very  
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Tourists  >ARG0
like  
the  
other  
reviewer  
might  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
appreciate*  
their  
efficiency  <ARG1
or  
quality  
,  
but  
I  
certainly  
do*  
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
a  
TGIF  <ARG2
or  
Cafe  
,  
it  >ARG1
s*  
a  
lunch  
sandwich  
place  <ARG2
and  
a  
good  
one  
at  
that  
.  

Rate*  
a  
church  <ARG1
?  

Might  >>ARGM-MOD
as  >>ARGM-ADV
well  
just  >ARGM-ADV
hotpot*  
the  
curb  <ARG1
and  
rate*  
the  
traffic  
light  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
a  
bloody  
church  <ARG2
,  
for  
chrisssake  <ARGM-DIS
!  

Big  
,  
grey  
and  
imposing  
.  

Go*  
there  <ARG4
on  
christian  >ARGM-ADJ
holidays*  
for  
a  
bit  <<ARGM-PRP
of  
churchy  
grandure  
.  

The  
pastor  >>ARG1
at  
this  
church  
is*  
cool*  
,  
I  >ARG0
met*  
him  <ARG1
after  
some  
holiday  >ARGM-TMP
service*  
.  

He  >ARG0
had*  
a  
robe  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
was*  
made*  
back  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
'60s  
.  

God  >>ARG1
was*  
pleased*  
with  
that  
one  <ARG0
!  

It  >ARG1
's*  
historical  <ARG2
for  
Sf  <ARGM-GOL
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
when  >ARGM-TMP
your  
aunte  >ARG1
comes*  >>ARGM-TMP
for  
a  
visit*  
,  
take*  
her  <ARG1
there  <ARG3
.  

Great  
for  
the  
kiddies  
-  
they  >ARG0
love*  
the  
labyrinth  <ARG1
(  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG

that

It  >ARG1

a  
Saturday  <ARG2

my

I  >>ARG0
googled*  
Garage  >ARG1

the

and  
was*  
oh

She  >ARG0
sort

for  
Dan  >>ARG0
taking*

I  >ARG0

time  <ARGM-TMP
at  
10

I  >>ARG0
enjoyed*  
speaking*  
with  
Dan  <ARG2

and  
learning*  
more  <ARG1
about  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
the

are*  
sized*  
for  
these  
doors  <ARGM-GOL

The

and  
the

extremely  >ARGM-ADV
fair*

I  >>ARG0

stuck

traffic

etc.  
THE  
LAST  
THING  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
WOULD  >ARGM-MOD
DO*  
IS*  
LET*  
A  
CHILD  >>ARG1
GET*  
RAPED*  
BECAUSE  
I  >>ARG2
WAS*  
N'T  >ARGM-NEG
PAID*  
.  

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  

I  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
easily  >>ARGM-MNR
go*  
to  
Nordstrom  <ARG4
for  
my  
designer  
jeans  <ARGM-PRP
and  
pay*  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
price*  
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
go*  
to  
the  
Garment  
District  <ARG4
for  
their  >ARG0
service*  
.  

Previous  
reviewers  >ARG0
said*  
they  >ARG1
were*  
pushy  <ARG2
and  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
understand*  
that  <ARG1
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
find*  
the  
staff  >ARG0
more  >ARGM-CXN
helpful*  
than  
anything  <ARGM-CXN
else  
.  

Tiffany  >>ARG1
is*  
fabulous*  
!  

I  >>ARG0
came*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
for  
alterations*  
(  
free  
,  
by  
the  
way*  
)  
and  
told*  
her  <ARG2
about  
a  
stain  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
had*  
on  
my  
new  
leather  
purse  <ARGM-LOC
.  

She  >>ARG0
immediately  >>ARGM-TMP
went*  
to  
the  
back  <ARG4
,  
brought*  
out  <ARG3
leather  
cleaner  <ARG1
and  
cleaned*  
my  
purse  <ARG1
on  
the  
spot  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
buy*  
the  
bag  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
!  

Huge  >ARGM-EXT
selection*  
and  
,  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
suggestions*  
from  
the  
staff  <ARG0
and  
they  >ARG0
refer*  
you  <ARG1
to  
reliable  
places  <ARG2
if  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
need*  
.  

We  >>ARG0
were*  
expecting*  
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
recieved*  
a  
friendly  >ARGM-ADJ
greeting*  
by  
the  
hosts  <ARG0
.  

The  
atmosphere  >>ARG1
was*  
nice*  
and  
very  >ARGM-EXT
clean*  
.  

The  
menu  >ARG0
had*  
plenty  <ARG1
of  
options  
even  
for  
picky  
eaters  <ARGM-GOL
.  

The  
service*  >ARG1
was*  
ok  <ARG2
,  
our  
waitress  >>ARG0
kept*  
forgetting*  
our  
drinks  <ARG1
even  
though  
we  >ARG0
reminded*  
her  <ARG2
several  
times  <ARGM-TMP
.  

To  
start*  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
tried*  
the  
guacamole  <ARG1
and  
salsa  
verde  
,  
it  >ARG1
was*  
completly  
flavorless  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
left*  
then  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >ARG0
orderd*  
our  
meals  <ARG1
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
,  
chimichangas  
,  
jalapeno  
borritos  
,  
and  
quesadillas  
.  

Everything  >ARG1
was*  
bland  <ARG2
,  
completely  
void  
of  
any  
spice  
or  
flavor  
.  

We  >>ARG0
have*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
had*  
mexican  
food  <ARG1
this  
bad  
,  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
simply  >ARGM-ADV
gross*  
.  

Hopefully  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG0
spice*  
things  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-PRD
or  
they  >ARG1
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
in  
business  <ARG2
long  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
recommend*  
La  
Hacienda  <ARG1

Might  >ARGM-MOD
try*  
again  <ARGM-TMP

Pros  
:  
*  
Jill  >>ARG0
,  
the  
owner  
,  
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
nice*  
and  
really  >ARGM-ADV
cares*  
about  
her  
feedback  <ARG1
*  
Pretty  
nice  
atmosphere  
*  
Great  
Dessert  
*  
Not  >ARGM-NEG
your  >ARG0
typical  >ARGM-ADJ
veggie  >ARG1
selection*  
,  
I  >ARG0
like*  
!  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
where  >ARGM-LOC
else  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
find*  
Purple  
Hull  
Peas  <ARG1
and  
some  
of  
the  
other  
sides  
.  

Cons  
:  
*  
Server  >>ARG1
was*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
very  >ARGM-EXT
pleasant*  
*  
Pretty  
small  
portion  
on  
the  
blackened  
catfish  
*  
Overcooked*  
food  <ARG1
*  
Time  
,  
took*  
about  
25  
minutes  <ARG1
from  
ordering*  
to  
eating*  
.  

Half  
the  
tables  >ARG1
and  
bar  
were*  
empty  <ARG2
by  
this  
point  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Other  >ARGM-ADJ
Thoughts*  
:  
Will  >ARGM-MOD
try*  
this  
place  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

There  
must  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
reason  >ARGM-CAU
so  
many  
people  >ARG0
like*  
it  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Their  
Club  
sandwich  >ARG0
looks*  
tasty  <ARG1
,  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
change*  
my  
mind  <ARG1
....  
and  
a  
different  
server  <C-ARG0
.  

very  
professional  
/  
very  
helpful  

the  
people  >>ARG0
at  
Fidelity  
Leasing  
were*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
friendly*  
and  
helpful*  
.  

i  >>ARG0
was*  
looking*  
for  
a  
car  <ARG1
but  
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-ADV
know*  
what  >ARG1
i  >ARG0
wanted*  
and  
they  >>ARG0
were*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful*  
and  
took*  
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
first  >ARGM-TMP
figure*  
out  
what  >>ARG2
my  >ARG0
needs*  >ARG1
were*  
and  
showing*  
me  <ARG2
various  
options  <ARG1
to  
meet*  
those  
needs*  
.  

they  >>ARG1
seemed*  
more  >ARGM-EXT
interested*  
in  
helping*  
me  >ARG0
find*  
the  
right  
car  <ARG1
rather  
then  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
make*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
sale*  
.  

my  >ARG0
experience*  >>ARG1
with  
them  <ARG1
was*  
great*  
-  
low  
stress  
,  
very  
helpful  
and  
very  
personal  
.  

after  
finding*  >ARGM-TMP
the  
car  <ARG1
i  >ARG0
wanted*  
they  >ARG0
took*  
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
go*  
over*  
each  
step*  
and  
making*  
it  >ARG0
as  >ARGM-CXN
painless*  
as  
possible  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

from  
start*  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
finish*  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG1
were*  
top  
notch  <ARG2
.  

i  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
calling*  
these  
people  <ARG1
up  <C-V
for  
your  
next  
car  <ARGM-PRP
.  

This  
insurance  
co.  >ARG1
Is*  
a  
joke*  
!!!  

They  >ARG0
have*  
absolutely  
no  
communication  
skills  <ARG1
whatsoever  
.  

if  
you  >>ARG2
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
mind*  >>ARGM-ADV
being*  
robbed*  
,  
cheated*  
or  
lied*  
to  <C-ARG2
then  >ARGM-ADV
this  >ARG1
is*  
the  
company  <ARG2
for  
you  
.  

They  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
make*  >ARGM-LVB
every  
attempt*  
to  
misinform*  
and  
misrepresent*  
themselves  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
make*  
up  
excuses*  
in  
hopes*  
to  
confuse*  
their  
policy  
holders  <ARG1
with  
misinformation*  
.  

as  
an  
example  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
took*  
payment*  
for  
5  
out  
of  
6  
monthly  
plan  
premiums  <ARG3
for  
a  
yearly  
policy  <ARG3
and  
cancelled*  
the  
contract  <ARG1
for  
the  
remainder  
of  
the  
policy  
for  
reasons  >>ARG0
they  >ARG0
stated*  
was*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
receiving*  
information  <ARG1
on  
other  
licensed  
drivers  
in  
the  
household  
?  

I  >ARG0
personally  >ARGM-MNR
provided*  
the  
request*  
on  
four  
separate  >ARGM-ADJ
occasions*  
and  
they  >ARG0
claim*  
there  
is*  
a  
glitch  <ARG1
in  
their  
systems  
?  

Ifa  >ARG1
is*  
an  
acronym  <ARG2
for  
I  >ARG1
m*  
a  
F%#king  
Assh@%$e  <ARG2
!!!  

Fantastic  >ARGM-ADJ
Service*  
!  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
here  <ARG2
a  
few  
times  <ARGM-TMP
for  
oil  >ARG1
changes*  
and  
just  >ARGM-TMP
got*  
my  
tires  >>ARG1
,  
alignment*  
and  
state  >ARG0
inspection*  
done*  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
shopped*  
it  <ARG1
around  <ARGM-ADV
and  
they  >>ARG0
were*  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
competitive*  
in  
pricing*  
and  
also  >ARGM-ADV
added*  
nitrogen  <ARG1
to  
my  
tires  <ARG2
which  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
extend*  
the  
life  <ARG1
and  
get*  
me  <ARG4
better  
gas  
mileage  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
also  >ARGM-DIS
came*  
with  
free  
balance  <ARGM-MNR
and  
rotation*  
for  
the  
life  <ARG1
of  
the  
tires  
!  

What  >ARG0
made*  >>ARG1
it  >ARG1
perfect*  
was*  
that  
they  >ARG0
offered*  
transportation*  
so  
that  
I  >>ARG0
would  
not  
have*  
to  
wait*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
or  
take*  
time  <ARG1
off  <C-V
of  
work*  
to  
go*  
back  <ARG1
and  
forth  
or  
try*  
to  
find*  
a  
ride*  
.  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
,  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
pricing*  
and  
SUPER  
CONVENIENT  
!  

I  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-DIS
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
feel*  
like  
they  >>ARG0
tried*  
to  
sell*  
me  <ARG2
a  
bunch  <ARG1
of  
services*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
need*  
.  

Love*  
my  
home  <ARG1
at  
Creekside  

I  >>ARG0
moved*  
to  
Creekside  
Apartments  <ARG2
in  
August  <ARGM-TMP
2008  
with  
a  
6  
-  
month  
lease  <ARGM-MNR
and  
have*  
just  >ARGM-TMP
extended*  
it  <ARG1
for  
another  
13  
months  <ARG2
!  

The  
management*  >>ARG1
from  
Julie  <ARGM-ADJ
and  
Janice  
to  
the  
work  
staff  <ARGM-ADJ
,  
esp.  
Edwin  
,  
are*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
wonderful*  
.  

They  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
extremely  >ARGM-ADV
helpful*  
whenever  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
have*  
asked*  
for  
help*  
.  

Although  
the  
apartments  >>ARG0
are*  
facing*  >>ARGM-ADV
Stokes  
Street  <ARG1
and  
close  
to  
the  
Bascom  
Light  
Rail  
,  
the  
location  >>ARG1
is*  
surprisingly  >ARGM-MNR
quiet*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
had*  
any  
problems  <ARG1
with  
loud  
neighbors  
or  
concerns*  
about  
safety  <ARG0
.  

The  
apartments  >ARG1
are*  
within  
walking  
distance  <ARG2
to  
Trader  
Joe  
's  
,  
Whole  
Foods  
,  
and  
other  
stores  
.  

The  
well  >ARGM-MNR
-  
equipped*  
,  
clean  
gym  >ARG1
is*  
a  
plus  <ARG2
!  

Great  
place  >ARGM-LOC
to  
live*  
if  
you  >ARG0
work*  
in  
and  
around  
downtown  
San  <ARGM-LOC
Jose  
!  

I  >ARG0
interviewed*  
several  
contractors  <ARG1
for  
a  
kitchen  
remodel  <ARG2
.  

Liberty  
construction  >ARG1
shows*  
up  
and  
it  >ARG1
's*  
two  
guys  <ARG2
...  
all  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
get*  
is*  
100  
%  >ARGM-ADJ
sales  >ARGM-ADJ
pitch*  
"  
We  >ARG1
're*  
the  
best  <ARG2
...  
we  >ARG1
're*  
number  <ARG2
50  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
doing*  
something  <ARG1
right  <ARGM-MNR
...  
look*  
at  
all  
these  
certificates  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
say*  
we  >>ARG1
're*  
great*  
"  
.  

Not  
once  >>ARGM-NEG
did  
I  >>ARG1
feel*  
listened*  
to  <C-ARG1
like  
they  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
cared*  
about  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
wanted*  
,  
all  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG1
were*  
interested*  
in  <C-ARG2
was*  
me  >ARG0
signing*  
a  
contract  <ARG1
right  
then  <ARGM-TMP
and  
there  
.  

Very  
high  
pressured  >ARGM-ADJ
sales*  
and  
with  
the  
reviews*  
of  
many  
others  <ARG0
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
.  

I  >>ARG1
'm*  
glad*  
I  >>ARG1
trusted*  
my  
gut  <ARG1
and  
did*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
get*  
sucked*  
into  
doing*  
business  <ARG1
with  
them  
.  

Find*  
someone  >>ARG0
you  >ARG0
trust*  
that  >>R-ARG0
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
hears*  
you  <ARG2
and  
wants*  
to  
do*  
the  
job  <ARG1
right  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
waste*  
your  
time  <ARG1
or  
money  
!  

I  >ARG0
took*  
my  
3  
year  
old  
son  <ARG1
here  <ARG3
at  
the  
weekend  <ARGM-TMP
and  
to  
be*  
honest*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
apart  >ARGM-ADV
from  
the  
shark  
walkway  
,  
I  >ARG0
thought*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
rubbish  <ARG2
and  
overpriced  
.  

Even  
taking*  >>ARGM-ADV
into  
account*  
the  
fact  
that  
my  
3  
year  
old  >>ARG0
wanted*  
to  
run*  
most  <ARG1
of  
the  
way*  
round  <<ARGM-DIR
,  
it  >ARG0
took*  
us  <ARG2
just  
over  
one  
hour  <ARG1
start*  
to  
finish*  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
to  
the  
London  
Aquarium  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
bother*  
with  
this  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
are*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
desperate*  >>ARGM-ADV
for  
something  >ARG0
to  
pass*  
the  
time  <ARG1
and  
are*  
willing*  
to  
shell*  
out  
the  
best  
part  <ARG1
of  
£  
30  
for  
2  
two  
people  <ARG2
then  >ARGM-ADV
go*  
for  
it  <ARG1
.  

(  
For  
some  
reason  >ARGM-PRP
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
let*  
me  >ARG0
rate*  
it  <ARG1
one  
star  <ARG2
-  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
rated*  
5  <ARG2
by  
me  <ARG0
!  
)  

Cranmore  
Dental  
and  
Implant  
Clinic  
:  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
recommend*  
Dr  <ARG1
David  
Nelson  
enough  <ARGM-EXT
.  

I  >ARG0
had*  
a  
severe  
phobia  <ARG1
of  
attending*  
the  
dentist  <ARG1
until  
I  >>ARG1
met*  
and  
was*  
treated*  
by  <ARG0
Dr  <ARG0
Nelson  
.  

He  >ARG0
instantaneously  >ARGM-TMP
put*  
me  <ARG1
at  
ease  <ARG2
and  
his  >ARG1
ongoing  >ARGM-TMP
treatments*  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
absolutely  >ARGM-ADV
pain  >ARG2
free*  
.  

My  >ARG0
previous  >ARGM-TMP
apprehension*  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
dismissed*  
and  
I  >>ARG0
no  
longer  >>ARGM-NEG
have*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
sinking  >ARG1
feeling*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
my  >ARG0
next  >ARGM-TMP

In  
addition*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
the  
core  >ARGM-ADJ
treatment*  
,  
Dr  >>ARG0
Nelson  
has*  
impressed*  
me  <ARG1
further  <ARGM-EXT
with  
his  >>ARG1
concern*  
and  
interest*  
in  
the  
well  >ARGM-MNR
-  
being*  
of  
his  
patients  <ARG1
–  
his  >ARG0
dental  >ARG1
work*  >ARG1
underpinned*  
by  
a  
strong  
duty  <ARG0
of  
care*  
to  
every  
patient  <ARG1

He  >>ARG0
is*  
always  <ARGM-TMP
prepared  <ARG2
to  
go*  
the  
extra  
mile  <ARG1
to  
ensure*

any

hehehe

After  
my  
trees  >>ARG1
were*  
cleaned*  >ARGM-TMP
up  
,  
they  >ARG0
gave*  
me  <ARG2
a  
jar  <ARG1
of  
salsa  
.  

The  
owner  >ARG0
warned*  
me  <ARG2
that  
it  >ARG1
was*  
the  
best  
salsa  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had*  
,  
and  
he  >>ARG1
was*  
right*  
.  

No  >ARGM-NEG
joke*  
!  

I  >>ARG0
hate*  
to  
say*  
check*  
them  <ARG1
out  <C-V
just  
for  
the  
salsa  <ARGM-PRP
,  
but  
James  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
NEED*  
another  
jar  <ARG1
badly  <ARGM-EXT
:)  
All  
kidding*  >ARGM-ADV
aside  
,  
they  >ARG1
are*  
a  
very  
good  
company  <ARG2
,  
I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
hard  
time  <ARG1
giving*  >ARGM-LVB
any  
service  
biz  
a  
5  
star  >ARGM-ADJ
review*  
but  
they  >ARG1
came*  
close  <ARG2
.  

Very  
affordable  
(  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
call*  
it  >ARG1
cheap*  
)  
and  
their  
trimmers  >>ARG1
were*  
quick*  
and  
courteous  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
got*  
home  <ARG2
from  
work*  
.  

And  
the  
salsa  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
be*  
sure*  
to  
ask*  
for  
a  
jar  <ARG1
and  
have*  
plenty  <ARG1
of  
chips  
around  
,  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
them  <ARG1
.....  

Dr.  >ARG0
Mann  
killed*  
our  
pet  <ARG1

Yea  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
Dr.  >>ARG1
Mann  
ai*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
so  >ARGM-EXT
great*  
.  

We  >ARG0
took*  
our  
beloved  
kitty  <ARG1
to  
him  <ARG3
and  
it  >ARG1
came*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
dead  <ARGM-PRD
.  

We  >ARG0
live*  
in  
the  
sub-division  <ARGM-LOC
around  
the  
corner  
and  
after  
it  >ARG1
happened*  >>ARGM-TMP
and  
we  >ARG0
brought*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
at  
some  
neighborhood  >ARG0
gatherings*  
we  >ARG0
discovered*  
that  
several  
people  >ARG0
from  
this  
neighborhood  
alone  
had*  
pets  >>ARG1
go*  
to  
Dr.  <ARG4
Mann  
for  
surgical  >ARGM-ADJ
procedures*  
and  
came*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
dead  <ARGM-PRD
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
take*  
him  <ARG1
here  <ARG3
for  
shots*  
,  
no  >ARGM-NEG
big  >ARGM-ADJ
deal*  
but  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
let*  
this  
man  >ARG0
apply*  
anesthetic  <ARG1
to  
my  
pet  <ARG2
ever  
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Oh  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
they  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-DIS
charged*  
me  <ARG2
for  
the  
procedure*  
(  
$  <<ARG1
250  
)  
AND  
had*  
the  
audacity  <ARG1
to  
charge*  
me  <ARG2
a  
$  
25  
'  
DISPOSAL  
'  
fee  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
itemized*  
it  <ARG1
as  
a  
DISPOSAL  
fee  <ARGM-MNR
.  

AVOID*  
AT  
ALL  
COSTS  <ARGM-MNR
.  

One  
of  
the  
worst  
places  

This  
place  >ARG1
and  
its  
sister  
store  
Peking  
Garden  
are*  
the  
worst  
places  >ARG3
to  
order*  
from  <C-ARG3
.  

the  
food  >>ARG1
was*  
horrible  <ARG2
not  >ARGM-NEG
cooked*  
like  
it  
should  
be*  
,  
they  >>ARG0
got*  
the  
order*  >ARG2
wrong*  
on  
a  
number  <<ARGM-TMP
of  
occasions*  
,  
and  
once  >ARGM-TMP
forgot*  
about  
my  >ARG0
order*  
.  

i  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
call*  
back  <ARGM-PRD
up  
there  <ARG1
two  
hours  
later  <ARGM-TMP
and  
the  
lady  >>ARG0
(  
who  >>R-ARG1
claimed*  
to  
be*  
a  
manager  <ARG2
)  
said*  
my  
food  >ARG1
was*  
on  
the  
way*  
,  
and  
she  >>ARG0
did*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
offer*  
to  
compensate*  
me  <ARG2
in  
any  
kind  <ARGM-MNR
of  
way*  
.  

i  >ARG1
waited*  
another  
30  
mins  <ARGM-TMP
before  
receiving*  
my  
food  <ARG1
and  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
cold*  
.  

in  
my  
opinon  >>ARGM-ADV
this  
place  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
shut*  
down  
by  
the  
health  
inspector  <ARG0
,  
and  
anyone  >>ARG0
who  >R-ARG1
is*  
satisfied  <ARG2
with  
there  >ARG0
service*  
and  
food  
has*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
eaten*  
at  
a  
real  
asian  
restaurant  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Gone*  
downhill  <ARGM-DIR
since  
change*  
in  
ownership*  

Sigh  
.  

I  >>ARG0
used*  
to  
LOVE*  
this  
place  <ARG1
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
now  >>ARGM-TMP
that  
they  >ARG1
are*  
part  <ARG2
of  
a  
chain  
,  
service*  >>ARG1
has*  
slipped*  
.  

I  >>ARG1
am*  
waiting*  
longer  <ARGM-ADV
at  
BNA  <ARGM-LOC
for  
my  
pickups  <ARG2
and  
last  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
parked*  
with  
them  <ARGM-COM
,  
they  >ARG3
lost*  
my  
car  
key  <ARG1
.  

Lucky  
I  >ARG0
had*  
a  
spare  <ARG1
with  
me  <ARGM-COM
!  

To  
date  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG1
have*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
made*  
good*  
by  
either  
finding*  
the  
key  <ARG1
or  
paying*  
for  
a  
new  
one  <ARG3
.  

(  
These  
new  
car  
keys  >>ARG1
are*  
EXPENSIVE*  
to  
copy*  
,  
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADV
go*  
to  
WalMart  <ARG4
.  
)  

Go*  
to  
the  
website  <ARG4
for  
coupons  <ARGM-PRP
and  
join*  
the  
club  <ARG1
-  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
free  >ARGM-ADJ
parking*  
.  

However  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
with  
BNA  >ARG0
offering*  >>ARGM-CAU
one  
day  <ARG1
of  
free  >ARGM-ADJ
parking*  
due  
to  
construction*  
of  
the  
new  
rental  
car  
facility  <ARG1
,  
it  
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
cheaper*  
to  
park*  
at  
BNA  <ARG2
.  

Wife  >>ARG0
and  
I  
attempted*  
to  
adopt*  
a  
dog  <ARG1
and  
was*  
nothing  <ARG2
but  
frustrating  
.  

We  >>ARG0
arrived*  
Sunday  <ARGM-TMP
at  
about  
230  <ARGM-TMP
and  
found*  
a  
do  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-EXT
liked*  
.  

We  >>ARG2
were*  
told*  
that  
we  
could  <ARG1
n't  
today  
because  
they  >>ARG1
were*  
closing*  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
called*  
the  
next  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
to  
let*  
then  >ARG0
know*  
my  
wife  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
driving*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
.  

They  >ARG0
gave*  
me  <ARG2
the  
run*  
around  <<ARG1
and  
missing  
paperwork  
only  >ARGM-ADV
to  
call*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
to  
tell*  
me  <ARG2
someone  >ARG0
else  
wanted*  
her  <ARG1
and  
I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
to  
come*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
and  
put*  
down  <ARG2
a  
deposit*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
work*  
2  
hours  
away  <ARGM-LOC
but  
offered*  
my  
card  <ARG1
over  
the  
phone  <ARGM-MNR
.  

They  >ARG0
refused*  
.  

Terrible  >ARGM-MNR
communication*  
as  <ARGM-ADJ
well  
.  

At  
one  
point  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
the  
dog  >>ARG1
had*  
been*  
fixed*  
,  
the  
next  
day  
it  
had*  
n't  
.  

Huge  
ammount  
of  
time  
wasted  
time  
and  
elevated  
blood  
pressure  
.

about

Over

BEWARE*  
!  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
fool*  
people  <ARG1

This  
store  >>ARG0
is*  
proof*  
that  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
fool*  
people  <ARG1
with  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
advertising*  
.  

They  >ARG0
convince*  
lots  <ARG1
of  
people  
that  
they  >ARG1
are*  
a  
great  
store  <ARG2
,  
when  >ARGM-ADV
in  
fact  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG1
are*  
a  
very  
average  
place  <ARG2
at  
best  <ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >ARG1
are*  
just  <ARGM-ADV
another  
big  
box  
store  <ARG2
like  
the  
others  
.  

They  >ARG0
offer*  
sales*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
are*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
really  <ARGM-ADV
sales*  
,  
mislabeled  
items  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
make*  
the  
item  >ARG1
sound*  
like  
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
deal*  
when  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
is*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
,  
a  
bad  
attitude  
about  
return  
items  
,  
and  
on  
and  
on  
.  

With  
higher  >ARGM-ADJ
than  
average  
prices*  
to  
boot*  
!  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
do*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
get*  
taken*  
in  
,  
keep*  
your  
eyes  >ARG1
open*  
if  
you  >>ARG0
choose*  
to  
shop*  
here  <ARG2
.  

On  
the  
other  
hand  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
Richmond  
Ukrops  
chain  >>ARG1
is*  
known*  
for  
its  >ARG0
charity  >ARGM-ADJ
work*  
,  
its  >ARG0
community  >ARG0
action*  
,  
and  
its  >ARG1
interest*  
in  
the  
public  
welfare  <ARG2
.  

Never  
again  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
here  <ARG4
unless  
you  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
sit*  
,  
order*  
,  
eat*  
and  
be*  
asked*  
to  
leave*  
all  
in  
a  
matter  <ARGM-TMP
of  
20  
minutes  
.  

You  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
have*  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
read*  
the  
entire  
menu  <ARG1
before  
being*  
asked*  
to  
order*  
and  
if  
you  >ARG0
ask*  >ARGM-ADV
for  
more  
time  <ARG1
your  
server  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
wait*  
at  
the  
table  <ARGM-LOC
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
the  
only  
place  >>ARGM-LOC
I  >>ARG0
have*  
ever  >>ARGM-TMP
eaten*  
and  
been*  
told*  
to  
leave*  
because  
other  
people  >>ARG1
were*  
waiting*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
told*  
to  
take*  
my  
coffee  <ARG1
to  
go*  
if  
I  >>ARG0
wanted*  
to  
finish*  
it  <ARG1
.  

Oh  
,  
and  
their  
liquor  
license  >ARG1
was*  
expired  <ARG2
so  
no  
Bloody  
Mary  
or  
Mimosas  
.  

Plus  
the  
drinks  >ARG1
are*  
self  >ARG2
service*  
,  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
fun*  
trying*  
to  
negotiate*  
the  
small  
cafeteria  
space  <ARG2
to  
get*  
your  
coffee  <ARG1
,  
juice  
or  
water  
.  

Go*  
next  
door  <ARGM-GOL
to  
the  
Ball  
Square  
Cafe  <ARG4
instead  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
guess*  
you  >ARG0
get*  
what  >ARG3
you  >ARG0
pay*  
for  <C-ARG3
.  

I  >>ARG1
tried*  
to  
stay*  
here  <ARG3
for  
a  
few  
nights  <ARGM-TMP
with  
my  
girlfriend  <ARGM-COM
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
asked*  
for  
a  
single  
queen  
bed  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG1
got*  
there  <ARG2
,  
and  
we  >>ARG2
were*  
treated*  
to  
the  
free  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
upgrade*  
"  
of  
a  
room  <ARG2
with  
two  
double  
beds  
.  

Since  
they  >ARG0
consider*  >>ARGM-CAU
this  <ARG1
an  
upgrade*  
,  
they  >>ARG0
let*  
their  
other  
rooms  >ARG1
fill*  
up  
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
change*  
our  
room  <ARG1
.  

Then  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG1
got*  
put*  
in  
a  
room  <ARG2
with  
a  
huge  
gap  
under  
the  
door  
....  
right  
next  
to  
the  
ice  
machine  
.  

We  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
hear*  
every  
single  
thing  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
happened*  
outside  <ARGM-LOC
like  
it  >ARG1
was*  
inside  
our  
room  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
finally  >ARGM-TMP
found*  >>ARGM-TMP
someone  >ARG0
at  
the  
desk  
who  >R-ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
speak*  
English  <ARG1
,  
they  >ARG0
moved*  
our  
room  <ARG1
,  
but  
we  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
receive*  
the  
single  
queen  >>ARG1
we  >>ARG0
had*  
"  
reserved*  
"  

I  >>ARG1
was*  
thoroughly  >ARGM-EXT
impressed*  
!  

I  >ARG0
had*  
a  
problem  <ARG1
with  
the  
tile  >ARG1
in  
my  
bathroom  
coming*  
apart  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
called*  
a  
few  
different  
businesses  <ARG1
in  
the  
area  
to  
get*  
estimates*  
,  
they  >ARG1
were*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
the  
cheapest  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
found*  
but  
very  
reasonable  
.  

The  
best  
part  >ARG1
is*  
I  >ARG0
got*  
my  
whole  
bathroom  >ARG1
remodeled*  
for  
about  >ARGM-ADV
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
price*  >>ARG3
the  
other  
company's  >>ARG0
were*  
quoting*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
to  
fix*  
the  
shower  
tile  <ARG1
and  
fixtures  
.  

They  >ARG0
had*  
the  
work*  >ARGM-PRR
done*  
in  
about  
half  
the  
time  >ARG3
quoted*  
which  >ARG0
made*  
me  >ARG1
and  
my  
wife  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
happy*  
.  

We  >>ARG0
have*  
had*  
nothing  <ARG1
but  
compliments  
on  
our  
bathroom  
when  >ARGM-TMP
guest  >ARG1
come*  
over  <ARGM-DIR
-  
who  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
guessed*  
that  
one  <ARG1
?  

Very  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
work*  
and  
friendly  
guys  
too  
.  

Best  
money  >>ARG3
I  >>ARG0
've*  
spent*  
on  
remodeling*  
ever  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
any  
one  >>ARG0
considering*  
home  >ARG1
repair*  
to  
give*  >ARGM-LVB
these  
guys  >ARG1
a  
call*  
.  

New  
training  
Centre  >>ARG1
is*  
excellent*  

The  
Award  
Dance  
Centre  >>ARG1
has*  
moved*  
from  
its  
Holderness  
Road  
site  <ARGM-DIR
to  
a  
new  
complex  <ARG2
on  
Chamberlain  
Road  
Hull  
.  

The  
new  
Centre  >>ARG0
has*  
4  
studios  >ARG1
planned*  
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
boasts*  
the  
largest  
single  
dance  
floor  
area  <ARG1
in  
Kingston  
upon  
Hull  
.  

The  
classes  >ARG0
cover*  
all  
age  
and  
skill  
ranges  <ARG1
,  
with  
BALLROOM  <ARG2
,  
LATIN  
,  
SEQUENCE  
,  
STREET  
,  
DISCO  
,  
LINE  >ARG1
DANCING*  
,  
BALLET*  
,  
TAP  
&  
JAZZ  
.  

We  >>ARG0
have*  
attended*  
A  
Ward  
Dance  
Centre  <ARG1
for  
over  
a  
year  <ARGM-TMP
and  
really  >ARGM-EXT
enjoy*  
the  
friendly  >ARGM-MNR
and  
welcoming  
way*  >>ARGM-MNR
we  >>ARG2
are*  
taught*  
Ballroom  <ARG1
and  
Latin  
as  
well  
as  
the  
fun  
filled  
social  >ARGM-ADJ
dance*  
evening  >ARG1
held*  
every  
Saturday  
evening  <ARGM-TMP
....  

It  
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-ADV
possible*  
to  
score*  
this  
school  <ARG1
too  
highly  <ARGM-MNR
,  
We  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
give*  
it  <ARG2
12  <ARG1
out  
of  
10  
and  
5  
Stars  
across  
the  
board  
Steve  
&  
Anne  

I  >ARG0
purchased*  
a  
2  
-  
year  
old  
certified  
pre-owned  
BMW  <ARG1
from  
this  
dealership  <ARG2
.  

The  
night  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
drove*  
back  
home  <ARGM-GOL
,  
I  >ARG0
found*  
that  
the  
rear  
window  >>ARG0
has*  >ARGM-LVB
some  
leakage*  
.  

(  
You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
hear*  
the  
wind  <ARG1
while  
driving*  
on  
highway  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Very  
likely  
it  >ARG0
needs*  
a  
new  
window  
seal  <ARG1
)  
.  

I  >ARG0
admit*  
that  
I  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
paid*  >ARGM-LVB
attention*  
to  
this  
kind  <ARG1
of  
little  
things  
while  
test  >ARGM-PRP
drive*  
.  

(  
But  >ARGM-DIS
this  >ARG1
is*  
a  
certified  
car  <ARG2
from  
a  
dealer  
.  
)  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
brought*  
the  
car  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
the  
second  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
that  
this  >>ARG0
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
under  
warranty  <ARG2
and  
want*  
to  
charge*  
me  <ARG2
$  <ARG1
175  
just  >ARGM-ADV
to  
diagnose*  
the  
problem  <ARG2
!  

Who  >ARG0
knows*  
how  
much  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
want*  
me  >ARG0
to  
pay*  
to  
fix*  
this  
thing  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
walked*  
away  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
my  
advice  >ARG1
is*  
that  
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
TRUST*  
THIS  
DEALER  <ARG1
.  

STAY*  
AWAY  <ARG3
AS  
FAR  <ARGM-ADV
AS  
POSSIBLE  
.  

Perfect  
Practice  

After  
I  >>ARG0
had*  
chosen*  >ARGM-TMP
The  
Fountain  
Dental  
Practice  <ARG1
they  >ARG0
provided*  
a  
slick  >ARGM-ADJ
and  
professional  
service*  
from  
start*  
to  
finish*  
.  

Everyone  >>ARG0
was*  
friendly*  
from  
the  
receptionist  <ARGM-ADV
to  
the  
surgeon  
herself  
,  
putting*  
me  <ARG1
at  
my  
ease  <ARG2
and  
explaining*  
the  
whole  >ARGM-ADJ
process*  
,  
both  
initially  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
then  
as  
we  >ARG0
went*  
along  <ARGM-PRD
.  

Surgery  >ARGM-PRP
visit*  >ARG1
timings*  >>ARG1
were*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
made*  
to  
suit*  
me  <ARG2
and  
not  
them  
and  
they  >ARG0
gave*  
me  <ARG2
the  
feeling*  
that  
I  >>ARG1
mattered*  
and  
was*  
important*  
to  
them  <ARG2
.  

The  
surgery  >ARG1
itself  
is*  
slick  <ARG2
,  
modern  
and  
very  
relaxed  
and  
I  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
felt*  
that  
I  >ARG1
was*  
in  
capable  
hands  <ARG2
.  

My  
dental  
surgeon  >>ARG0
,  
Dr.  
Lucy  
Nichols  
is*  
clearly  <ARGM-ADV
a  
dental  
perfectionist  <ARG2
and  
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
proud*  
both  
of  
the  
work*  >ARGM-PRR
she  <ARG0
does*  
and  
the  
reputation  >>ARG1
she  >>ARG0
has*  
established*  
.  

Everyone  >>ARG0
was*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
helpful*  
that  
I  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
wait*  
to  
go*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
.....

Wonderful  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
for  
large  
group  <ARG2

I  >>ARG0
had*  >ARGM-LVB
my  >ARGM-GOL
wedding  >ARGM-PRP
luncheon*  
at  
this  
BJ  
s  
restaurant  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
it  >ARG1
was*  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
choices*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
made*  
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
deal*  
--  
we  >ARG0
paid*  
a  
certain  
amount  <ARG1
per  
person  
,  
and  
my  
husband  >ARG0
and  
I  
chose*  
4  
types  <ARG1
of  
pizza  
and  
the  
servers  >ARG0
brought*  
out  <ARG3
as  
much  <ARG1
as  
we  >ARG0
wanted*  
.  

We  >>ARG2
were*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
served*  
salad  <ARG1
and  
soda  
.  

We  >>ARG0
had*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
large  >ARGM-EXT
party*  
,  
about  
fifty  
people  <ARGM-ADJ
or  
so  
,  
and  
yet  
everything  >>ARG1
was*  
served*  
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
we  >ARG0
all  
had*  
a  
wonderful  
time  <ARG1
.  

Even  
though  
we  >>ARG0
were*  
only  >ARGM-ADV
supposed*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
have*  
those  
specific  
types  <ARG1
of  
pizza  
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
guests  >ARG0
asked*  >>ARGM-TMP
for  
a  
different  
type  <ARG1
,  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
brought*  
out  <ARG3
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
charge*  
to  
us  <ARG2
!  

I  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
appreciate*  
BJ  <ARG1
s  
for  
making*  
that  
special  
day  >ARG1
even  >ARGM-EXT
better*  
with  
their  >ARG0
wonderful  >ARGM-ADJ
food  <<ARGM-MNR
and  
service*  
.  

wonderful  

I  >ARG0
went*  
to  
ohm  <ARG4
after  
reading*  
some  <ARG1
of  
the  
reviews*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
go*  
to  
school  <ARG4
in  
the  
area  <ARGM-LOC
and  
usually  >ARGM-ADV
wait*  
until  
I  >ARG0
go*  
home  <ARG4
to  
get*  
my  
hair  >ARG1
cut*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
decided*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
grow*  
up  
and  
made*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
appointment*  
.  

Sierra  >ARG1
was*  
my  
stylist  <ARG2
and  
i  >ARG0
love*  
what  >ARG1
she  >ARG0
did*  
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
wavy  
hair  <ARG1
and  
she  >ARG0
cut*  
to  
my  
hair  
style  <ARGM-MNR
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
the  
first  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
i  >>ARG0
had*  
left*  
a  
salon  <ARG1
with  
my  
hair  
curly  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Usually  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
blow*  >ARGM-MNR
dry*  
it  <ARG1
out  <C-V
and  
i  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
wait*  
until  
i  >ARG0
wash*  
it  <ARG1
to  
see*  
what  >ARG1
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
look*  
like  <C-ARG1
in  
its  
natural  
state  <ARGM-ADV
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
she  >>ARG0
did*  
a  
fabulous  
job  <ARG1
letting*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
what  >>ARG1
she  >>ARG0
was*  
doing*  
at  
all  
times  <ARGM-TMP
and  
styled*  
my  
hair  <ARG1
in  
a  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
i  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
it  <ARG1
at  
home  <ARGM-LOC
.  

It  >>ARG1
was*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
completly  >ARGM-EXT
impossible*  
!!!!  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
going*  
back  <ARG4

After  
recently  >ARGM-TMP
relocating*  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
South  
Bend  <ARG2
,  
we  >>ARG0
were*  
looking*  
for  
a  
delicious  
,  
fun  
,  
yet  
elegant  
establishment  <ARG1
for  
New  
Year  
s  
Eve  
dinner  <ARGM-PRP
.  

We  >ARG1
were*  
disappointed  <ARG2
with  
this  
holiday  
dinner  
due  
to  
the  
overall  >ARGM-ADJ
flavor  <ARGM-CAU
and  
price*  
of  
the  
meal  <ARG1
,  
and  
accessibility  
to  
the  
Jazz  
Club  
.  

The  
meal  >>ARG1
was*  
extremely  
overpriced  <ARG2
and  
lacked*  
flavor  <ARG1
,  
especially  
for  
being*  
a  
special  
NYE  
menu  <ARG2
.  

The  
limited  
menu  >ARG0
had*  
few  
appetizing  
options  <ARG1
and  
the  
NYE  
special  
packages  >ARG1
were*  
way  
overpriced  <ARG2
.  

After  
our  
meal  >ARGM-TMP
,  
our  
server  >ARG0
found*  
us  <ARG2
a  
table  <ARG1
in  
the  
jazz  
club  >>ARGM-LOC
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
we  >>ARG1
were*  
informed*  
it  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
another  
$  <ARG2
10  
/  
person  
to  
stay*  
and  
listen*  
to  
the  
band  <ARG1
,  
despite  
the  
fact  <<ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0
had*  
just  >ARGM-TMP
finished*  
a  
dinner  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
and  
were*  
intending*  
to  
enjoy*  
their  
drink  
list  <ARG1
.  

This  >ARG1
was*  
a  
less  >ARGM-ADJ
than  
impressive  
experience*  
at  
Trio  <ARGM-LOC
's  
.  

Run*  
for  
the  
hills  <ARGM-DIR
...  
you  >>ARG1
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
much  >ARGM-EXT
better*  
off  
!  

One  
night  >>ARG1
was*  
too  >ARGM-EXT
much*  
.  

First  
room  >ARG0
had*  
used  
tissues  <ARG1
next  
to  
the  
bed  
and  
I  >ARG0
requested*  
it  >>ARG1
be*  
rectified*  
.  

I  >>ARG1
was*  
then  >ARGM-TMP
moved*  
to  
another  
room  >>ARGM-LOC
around  
the  
back  
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
the  
room  >>ARG1
was*  
dirty*  
,  
the  
shower*  >>ARG1
was*  
dirty*  
with  
other  
people  
s  
hair  <ARG2
in  
it  
,  
the  
toilet  
seat  >>ARG1
was*  
peeling*  
and  
rough  
and  
the  
bathroom  >>ARG1
was*  
full*  
of  
mould  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG2
called*  
reception  <ARG1
to  
ask*  
if  
they  >ARG0
knew*  
the  
state  >ARG2
the  
room  >ARG1
was*  
in  <C-ARG2
and  
was*  
told*  
"  
This  >ARG1
is*  
a  
Days  
Inn  <ARG2
,  
not  
the  
Hilton  
"  
and  
the  
receptionist  >ARG0
then  >ARGM-TMP
hung*  
up  
on  
me  <ARG2
.  

To  
warn*  >>ARG1
you  >ARG1
to  
stay*  
away  <ARG3
from  
this  
place  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
is*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
enough*  
.  

There  
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
one  
ounce  <ARG1
of  
caring*  
involved  
and  
anyone  >>ARG2
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
warn*  
about  
the  
complete  >ARGM-EXT
lack*  
of  
service*  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
warned*

resolved*  
.  

Ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
wait*  
to  
go*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
!!!  

This  >ARG1
is*  
by  
far  <ARGM-EXT
the  
BEST  
B&B  >>ARG3
that  >>R-ARG3
we  >>ARG1
have*  
ever  >ARGM-NEG
stayed*  
at  <C-ARG3
!  

We  >ARG1
were*  
in  
Santa  
Fe  <ARG2
for  
a  
special  
event  <ARGM-PRP
and  
our  
hosts  >ARG0
rented*  
out  
the  
El  
Paradero  >ARG3
for  
all  
their  
guests  >ARG1
to  
stay*  
at  <C-ARG3
.  

We  >>ARG2
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
have*  
been*  
more  >ARGM-EXT
welcomed*  
,  
more  
comfortable  
or  
more  
well  >ARGM-ADV
fed*  
.  

The  
weekend  >>ARG1
was*  
perfect*  
in  
every  
way  <ARGM-ADV
,  
in  
large  
part  
to  
Sue  <ARGM-CAU
and  
her  
great  
staff  
.  

Everyone  >>ARG0
was*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
friendly*  
and  
really  >ARGM-ADV
went*  
out  
of  
their  >ARG0
way*  
to  
make*  
sure*  
everything  >ARG1
went*  
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

We  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
wait*  
to  
go*  
back  <ARG4
to  
Santa  
Fe  <ARG4
and  
to  
this  
great  
B&B  
...  
especially  
my  
4  
year  
old  >>ARG0
,  
who  >>R-ARG0
made*  
friends  <ARG1
with  
Ms.  <ARGM-COM
Sue  
and  
all  
the  
ladies  
,  
and  
has*  
talked*  
about  
them  <ARG1
since  
we  >ARG0
left*  
!  

We  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
the  
El  
Paradero  <ARG1
on  
your  >ARG0
next  >ARGM-TMP
trip*  
to  
Santa  
Fe  <ARG1
!  

Disatisfied  
customer  
,  
I  >>ARG0
went*  
through  
Kitchen  
Aid  <ARG2
and  
used*  
one  <ARG1
of  
their  
recommended  
vendors  
.  

A&E  >>ARG0
came*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
,  
charged*  
$  
129  
fee  <ARG1
just  >ARGM-ADV
to  
walk*  
in  
the  
door  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
needed*  
a  
part  <ARG1
for  
my  
appliance  
,  
the  
cost  >>ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
high*  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
said*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
mind*  
,  
paid*  
the  
fee  <ARG1
and  
called*  
a  
local  
business  <ARG1
for  
a  
second  >ARGM-TMP
quote*  
.  

The  
second  
vendor  >>ARG0
charged*  
$  <ARG1
55  
(  
less  
than  
half  
of  
what  >ARG1
A&E  >ARG0
charges*  
)  
to  
come*  
and  
applied*  
that  <ARG1
to  
the  
price*  
of  
the  
repair  >ARG1
service*  
(  
which  
A&E  
does*  
not  
)  
.  

Their  >ARG0
quote*  >ARG1
came*  
in  
at  
half  
the  
price*  
of  
A&E  <ARG0
for  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
work*  
and  
same  
part  
.  

Seems*  
to  
me  <ARG2
like  
A&E  >ARG0
charges*  
way  
more  <ARG1
than  
necessary  
!  

Very  
disappointed  
in  
Kitchen  
Aid  
as  
well  
,  
I  >ARG0
thought*  
that  
they  >ARG0
pre-screened*  
their  
vendors  <ARG1
for  
price*  
and  
quality  
of  
work*  
,  
obviously  
they  
do*  
not  
!  

Lovely  
Nails  
on  
Cayuga  
St.  
in  
Lewiston  
,  
NY  

First  >ARGM-TMP
let*  
me  >ARG0
start*  
out  
by  
saying*  
,  
that  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
had*  
very  
nice  
pedicures  <ARG1
at  
Lovely  
Nails  <ARGM-LOC
on  
Military  
Road  
.  

I  >>ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
excited*  
that  
a  
salon  >>ARG1
was*  
opening*  
in  
Lewiston  <ARGM-LOC
,  
as  
I  >ARG0
live*  
in  
Youngstown  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
in  <ARG2
two  
weeks  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
and  
had*  
the  
worst  
pedicure  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
had*  
in  
my  
life  <ARGM-TMP
.  

There  
were*  
four  <ARG1
of  
us  
and  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
taken*  
first  <ARGM-TMP
by  
a  
gentleman  <ARG0
.  

I  >ARG0
put*  
my  
foot  <ARG1
in  
the  
water  <ARG2
and  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
cool*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
did*  
warm*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
hurt*  
my  
toes  <ARG1
will  
pushing*  
my  
cuticles  <ARG1
back  <ARG2
.  

If  
the  
pedicure  >ARG1
lasted*  >ARGM-ADV
20  
mins.  <ARG2
,  
that  >ARG1
was*  
a  
stretch  <ARG2
.  

The  
other  
ladies  >>ARG0
had*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
similar  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
,  
both  >ARG0
had*  
nail  
polish  <ARG1
on  
a  
couple  <ARGM-LOC
of  
toes  
.  

None  >>ARG0
of  
us  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
using*  
their  >ARG0
services*  
again  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
which  >ARG1
is*  
a  
shame*  
.  

Good  >ARGM-ADJ
Service*  
-  
Limited  
Results  

Andrew  >>ARG0
was*  
helpful*  
and  
knowledgeable*  
about  
acupuncture  <ARG1
re  
:  
infertility  
.  

He  >>ARG0
was*  
willing*  
to  
talk*  
to  
me  <ARG2
about  
my  >ARG1
specific  >ARGM-ADJ
issues*  
and  
develop*  
a  
plan*  
of  
action*  
.  

The  
office  >>ARG1
is*  
shared*  
with  
a  
foot  
doctor  <ARG2
and  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
sterile*  
and  
medical  
feeling  
,  
which  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
liked*  
.  

The  
down  
side  >ARG1
was*  
that  
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
there  
was*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
noise  
in  
the  
hallway  
from  
other  
patients  
/  
doctors  
.  

I  >>ARG0
worked*  
with  
Andrew  <ARG3
for  
2  
months  <ARGM-TMP
and  
did*  
acupuncture  <ARG1
and  
herbs  
.  

The  
sessions*  >>ARG1
were*  
nice*  
and  
I  >>ARG0
felt*  
relaxed  <ARG1
after  
them  <ARGM-TMP
but  
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
notice*  
any  
changes*  
with  
my  
cycles  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
know*  
it  
can  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
a  
while  <ARG1
for  
results  <ARG0
and  
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
expect*  
a  
miracle  <ARG1
,  
but  
after  
2  
months  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
felt*  
like  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
entirely  >ARGM-EXT
worth*  
the  
cost  <ARG2
/  
time  
.  

(  
I  >ARG1
am*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
a  
little  
suspicious  <ARG2
of  
all  
these  
glowing*  >ARGM-PRD
reviews*  
...  
)  

Friendly  
,  
clean  
and  
excellent  
location  

The  
staff  >>ARG0
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful*  
,  
and  
gave*  
us  <ARG2
good  
advice  <ARG1
on  
day  
and  
night  
time  
activities  
.  

Common  
room  >>ARG1
was*  
comfortable  <ARG2
and  
clean*  
,  
very  
good  
room  >>ARGM-LOC
to  
read*  
or  
relax*  
.  
–  

A  
great  
breakfast  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
was*  
included*  
every  
morning  
until  
9:30  
am  
;  
yummy  
fresh  
Parisian  
croissants  
.  

Comfortable  
and  
clean  
beds  
,  
a  
bit  
noisy  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
people  >>ARG1
were*  
coming*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
late  <ARGM-TMP
from  
a  
night  <ARG3
out  
,  
but  
we  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
mind*  
too  
much  <ARGM-EXT
as  
we  >>ARG1
were*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
just  >ARGM-TMP
coming*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
from  
a  
night  <ARG3
out  
!  

The  
location  >ARG1
is*  
really  
stellar  <ARG2
!  

It  >ARG1
is*  
next  
to  
Gare  <ARG2
du  
Nord  
and  
a  
five  
minute  >ARGM-TMP
walk*  
to  
Sacre  
Coeur  <ARG2
which  >>ARG0
is*  
excellent*  
for  
shopping*  
.  

It  >>ARG1
is*  
close*  
to  
bus  
lines  <ARG2
for  
Opera  
Plaza  
,  
Galleries  
Lafayette  
,  
and  
the  
famous  
flea  
Market  
.  

We  >>ARG1
really  >ARGM-ADV
enjoyed*  
our  >ARG1
stay*  
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
stay*  
at  
the  
Vintage  
Hostel  <ARG3
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Just  
Autos  >ARGM-DIS
Thank*  
you  <ARG1
!  

Was*  
fast*  
and  
easy*  
,  
Just  >ARGM-ADV
had*  
our  
car  >ARG1
returned*  
this  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend*  
these  
Mobile  
Mechanics  <ARG1
for  
sure  <ARGM-ADV
.  

They  >ARG0
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
know*  
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
are*  
doing*  
.  

The  
mechanic  >>ARG0
came*  
to  
our  
place  <ARG4
and  
sorted*  
out  
our  
car  
s  
problems  <ARG1
,  
he  >>ARG0
explained*  
the  
problem  <ARG1
and  
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
up  
front  <ARG2
and  
honest*  
,  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
towed*  
to  
the  
workshop  <ARG2
as  
the  
gearbox  >>ARG1
was*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
working*  
(  
he  >ARG0
explained*  
it  <ARG1
better  <ARGM-CXN
)  
.  

They  >>ARG0
phoned*  
the  
same  
day  <ARGM-TMP
,  
confirmed*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
the  
gearbox  <ARG2
quoted*  
me  <ARGM-GOL
the  
job  <ARG3
,  
I  >>ARG0
gave*  
the  
go  
ahead*  
.  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
my  
car  
s  
gears  >>ARG1
and  
brakes  
have*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
run*  
so  
well  <ARGM-EXT
...  
ever  <ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
s*  
like  
driving*  
a  
new  
car  <ARG1
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hesitate*  
in  
recommending*  
the  
team  <ARG1
at  
Just  
Autos  
for  
easy  >ARGM-ADJ
professional  >ARGM-ADJ
car  >ARG1
repairs*  
,  
Thank*  
you  <ARG1
Just  
Autos  <ARGM-DIS
for  
your  >ARG0
help*  
.  

I  >ARG0
stopped*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
today  <ARGM-TMP
@  
Yards  
Brewery  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
,  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
impressed*  
with  
the  
size  <ARG0
of  
the  
bar  
area  
and  
lounge  
,  
&  
I  >ARG0
liked*  
that  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
see*  
the  
brewery  <ARG1
right  
thru  
the  
glass  <ARGM-DIR
!  

I  >ARG0
had*  
a  
sampler  <ARG1
of  
IPA  
,  
Brawler  
,  
Love  
Stout  
&  
ESA  
.  

All  >>ARG0
were*  
awesome*  
,  
&  
I  >ARG0
had*  
a  
Dogwood  
Grilled  
Cheese  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
was*  
enjoyable*  
with  
the  
fine  
beers  <ARGM-COM
.  

After  
my  
sampler  >ARGM-TMP
&  
sandwich  
,  
I  >ARG0
asked*  
for  
a  
pint  <ARG1
of  
there  
Nitrogen  
Love  
Stout  
,  
I  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
impressed*  
,  
with  
the  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
taste*  
&  
I  >ARG1
am*  
a  
Guiness  
Lover  <ARG2
so  >>ARGM-ADV
coming*  >ARGM-ADV
from  
me  <ARG3
,  
I  >ARG0
think*  
this  >>ARG1
is*  
better*  
,  
it  >>ARG1
s*  
less  
dry  <ARG2
&  
smoother*  
!  

If  
you  >ARG1
are*  
in  
Philly  <ARG2
you  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
come*  
check*  
this  
place  <ARG1
out  <C-V
!  

The  
only  
negative  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
have*  
abou  
this  
place  
is*  
the  
parking*  
!  

I  >ARG0
left*  
with  
a  
case  <ARGM-MNR
of  
BRAWLER  
!!!!  
!  

Oil  >ARG1
Change*  
Disaster  

My  
wife  >>ARG0
had*  
taken*  
her  
'07  
Ford  
Fusion  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
for  
a  
routine  >ARGM-ADJ
oil  >ARG1
change*  
.  

A  
couple  
days  
after  
the  
oil  >ARG1
change*  >ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
engine  >ARG1
ran*  
rough  <ARGM-MNR
,  
the  
low  
oil  
pressure  
light  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
come*  
on  
sporadically  <ARGM-ADV
,  
and  
the  
engine  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
whir*  
loudly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Turns*  
out  
the  
engine  >ARG0
had*  
no  
oil  <ARG1
,  
and  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
oil  >>ARG1
was*  
put*  >ARGM-TMP
it  <ARG2
,  
it  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
run*  
out  
of  
the  
filter  <ARGM-DIR
.  

There  
could  
have*  
(  
hopefully  
does*  
n't  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
)  
major  >ARGM-EXT
damage*  
to  
the  
engine  <ARG1
.  

All  >ARG1
of  
this  
started*  
after  
their  >ARG0
oil  >ARG1
change*  
.  

Once  
they  >ARG0
realized*  >>ARGM-TMP
their  >ARG0
mistake*  
they  >>ARG0
sent*  
a  
mechanic  <ARG1
and  
tow  
truck  
to  
my  
wife  >ARG0
's  
work*  
and  
towed*  
it  <ARG1
back  <ARG2
to  
fix*  
it  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
recommend*  
this  
shop  <ARG1
for  
anything  <ARG4
,  
not  
even  
something  
as  
simple  
as  
an  
oil  >ARG1
change*  
.  

Plus  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
overcharge*  
you  <ARG2
for  
just  
about  
everything  <ARG3
,  
and  
smile*  
while  
doing*  
it  <ARG1
.  

Liars  
,  
negative  
stars  
!  

Took*  
my  
Cruze  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
twice  <ARGM-TMP
for  
poor  
fuel  
economy  <ARGM-CAU
.  

The  
first  
time  >ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
claimed*  
to  
get*  
reasonable  
mpg  <ARG1
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
they  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
drive*  
the  
car  <ARG1
with  
me  
in  
it  <ARGM-ADV
to  
prove*  
their  >ARG0
findings*  
.  

I  >ARG0
wonder*  
if  
they  >>ARG0
were*  
going*  
down  
a  
hill  <ARGM-DIR
!  

They  >ARG0
told*  
me  >ARG0
to  
bring*  
it  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
after  
5000  
miles  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
brought*  
it  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
with  
9000  
miles  <ARGM-ADV
.  

They  >>ARG0
"  
finished*  
"  
the  
work*  
and  
told*  
me  <ARG2
the  
car  >>ARG1
was*  
ready*  
.  

I  >ARG0
found*  
out  
they  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
drive*  
the  
car  <ARG1
,  
stated*  
they  >ARG0
looked*  
at  
it  <ARG1
before  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >>ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
drive*  
the  
car  <ARG1
with  
me  <ARGM-COM
to  
show*  
their  
mpg  
number  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
claimed*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
see*  
anything  <ARG1
wrong  
with  
the  
blower  
fan  
(  
a  
seperate  >ARGM-ADJ
issue*  
)  
,  
but  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
drove*  >ARGM-TMP
the  
car  <ARG1
home  <ARGM-GOL
I  >ARG0
had*  
the  
same  
symptoms  <ARG1

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
purchace*  
another  
vehicle  <ARG1

Great  
Job  

I  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
say*  
that  
Mike  >ARG0
did*  
a  
great  
job  <ARG1
for  
our  
family  <ARG2
in  
our  
time  <ARGM-TMP
of  
need*  
.  

Both  
my  
grandparents  >ARG1
passed*  
away  
4  
months  
apart  <ARGM-TMP
and  
Mike  >ARG1
was*  
very  
understanding  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
a  
very  
trying  
time  <ARG2
for  
my  
family  
and  
myself  
yet  
Mike  >ARG0
took*  
the  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
greet*  
each  
and  
every  
one  <ARG1
one  <ARG1
of  
us  
.  

He  >ARG1
is*  
very  
professional  <ARG2
in  
his  
position  <ARGM-ADV
as  
a  
director  
and  
yet  
he  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-ADV
made*  
time  >ARGM-ADV
to  
be*  
compassionate  <ARG2
for  
what  >>ARG2
we  >>ARG1
were*  
all  
going*  
through  <C-ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
sure*  
it  
s*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
every  
day  <ARG2
that  
a  
funeral  
director  >ARG0
sees*  
the  
same  
family  <ARG1
in  
such  
a  
short  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

My  
grandfather  >ARG1
passed*  
away  
silently  <ARGM-MNR
in  
his  
sleep  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
my  
grandmother  >ARG1
passed*  
away  
after  
a  
short  >ARGM-TMP
struggle*  
with  
cancer  <ARG1
.  

Both  
my  
grandparents  >>ARG1
looked*  
as  >ARGM-CXN
natural*  
as  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
expected*  
.  

Thank*  
you  <ARG1
Mike  <ARGM-DIS
for  
all  
your  >ARG0
help*  
professionally  <<ARGM-MNR
and  
personally  
.

Peterson  
Family  

Poor  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  

If  
you  >ARG0
like*  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
drama  >ARG1
described*  
in  
popular  
sitcom  <ARGM-LOC
'  
Seinfeld  
'  
,  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
see*  
it  <ARG1
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

We  >ARG0
signed*  
our  
name  <ARG1
in  <C-V
about  
6:00  
pm  <ARGM-TMP
.  

There  
were*  
3  
names  <ARG1
before  
us  
.  

The  
greeter  >ARG0
said*  
there  
was*  
about  
15  
minutes  >ARGM-TMP
waiting*  
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
we  >>ARG0
waited*  
and  
waited*  
and  
in  
the  
mean  
time  >ARGM-TMP
,  
saw*  
4  
groups  >ARG0
of  
people  
simply  >ARGM-MNR
just  >ARGM-ADV
paraded*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
without  
signing*  
there  
names  <ARG2
.  

This  
sign  
in  
policy  >>ARG1
is*  
posted*  
by  
the  
restaurant  <ARG0
“  
no  >ARGM-NEG
reservation*  
,  
sign*  
your  
name  <ARG2
here  <ARGM-LOC
”  
.  

I  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
ask*  
the  
greeter  <ARG2
,  
he  >ARG0
explained*  
his  
reasons  <ARG1
with  
broken  
English  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
understand*  
any  
his  
reasons  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
take*  
it  <ARG1
as  
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
seat*  
the  
people  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
know*  
first  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

My  >ARG0
conclusion*  >ARG1
is*  
that  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
go*  
there  <ARG4
if  
you  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
wait*  
a  
least  
an  
hour  <ARGM-TMP
and  
see*  
all  
kinds  >>ARG1
other  
people  
being*  
seated*  
before  
you  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Instructor  >ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
showed*  
up  
!  

January  
15th  
--  
We  >>ARG1
were*  
signed*  
up  
for  
Saturday  
's  
2  
PM  
class  <ARG3
"  
Beginning  
Yoga  
with  
Brittany  
.  
"  

We  >ARG1
even  >ARGM-ADV
arrived*  
10  
minutes  
early  <ARGM-TMP
as  
the  
website  >ARG0
suggests*  
.  

The  
instructor  >>ARG1
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
show*  
up  
!  

We  >>ARG0
waited*  
until  
2:25  
PM  <ARGM-TMP
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
left*  
.  

There  
were*  
2  <ARG1
in  
our  
group  
,  
and  
a  
3rd  
person  >>ARG1
was*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
parking  
lot  <ARG2
waiting*  
for  
this  
class  <ARG2
.  

Well  
,  
not  
much  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
except  
I  >ARG1
'm*  
very  
disappointed  <ARG2
with  
this  
experience*  
.  

This  >ARG1
was*  
our  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
visit*  
to  
your  
studio  <ARG1
.  

In  
today  
's  
instant  
world  >ARGM-LOC
,  
there  
's*  
no  
reason  <ARG1
for  
the  
instructor  
not  
to  
even  
have*  
given*  >ARGM-LVB
us  
a  
phone  >ARGM-MNR
call*  
or  
e-mail  
if  
she  >>ARG1
was*  
going*  
to  
be*  
late*  
.  

As  
a  
yoga  
studio  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
sure*  
you  >>ARG0
're*  
all  >ARGM-ADV
aware*  
that  
all  
actions*  >ARG2
generate*  
karma  <ARG1
…  

and  >ARGM-DIS
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
karma  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
manifest*  
itself  <ARG2
on  
a  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
review*  
on  
Google  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Finest  
??  

Really  
??  

I  >>ARG0
beg*  
to  
differ*  
.  

This  
place  >>ARG1
is*  
marginal*  
at  
best  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Not  
very  
welcoming  
and  
focused  
mostly  
on  
keeping*  
little  
kids  <ARG1
entertained  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG1
was*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
impressed*  
,  
and  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
frustrated*  
at  
their  >ARG0
lack*  
of  
rating*  
for  
their  
courses  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
understand*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
wanting*  
to  
put*  
labels  <ARG1
like  
5.10  
on  
an  
indoor  
course  <ARG2
,  
because  
yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
it  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
same  <ARG2
,  
but  
some  
clear  >ARGM-ADJ
understanding*  >>ARG1
of  
the  
difficulty  <ARG1
of  
one  
course  
to  
another  
is*  
nice*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
are*  
an  
intermediate  
climber  >ARG0
looking*  
to  
improve*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
waste*  
my  
time  <ARG1
on  
routes  >ARG1
set*  
for  
children  <ARG2
,  
but  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
take*  
on  
something  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
handle*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
to  
strain*  
myself  <ARG1
to  
exhaustion  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Rate*  
the  
routes  <ARG1
,  
with  
understandable  >ARGM-ADJ
markings*  
and  
a  
more  
detailed  
system  
than  
easy  
,  
moderate  
,  
and  
hard  
.  

Again  
,  
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
outing*  
for  
the  
kids  <ARG0
,  
a  
frustration*  
for  
an  
out  
of  
town  
climber  <ARG1
.  

Best  
DJ's  
In  
Town  
!  

Wow  
!  

These  
guys  >ARG1
were*  
the  
best  <ARG2
.  

They  >>ARG0
were*  
thorough*  
,  
high  
class  
,  
and  
went*  
above  <ARGM-ADV
and  
beyond  
.  

We  >>ARG0
never  
had*  
to  
worry*  
about  
a  
thing  <ARG1
,  
and  
they  >ARG0
led*  
the  
way*  
the  
whole  
time  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >>ARG0
asked*  
us  <ARG2
things  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
we  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
never  >>ARGM-NEG
have*  
thought*  
of  <C-ARG1
,  
and  
took*  
extra  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
meet*  
with  
us  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
needed*  
it  <ARG1
before  
the  
wedding*  
.  

Having*  >ARG1
a  
team  <ARG1
was*  
the  
best  <ARG2
because  
they  >ARG0
kept*  
the  
flow*  >>ARG1
of  
the  
wedding*  
going*  
the  
whole  
time  <ARGM-TMP
!  

They  >>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
look*  
young*  
but  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
let*  
that  >ARG0
fool*  
you  <ARG1
,  
as  
their  
knowledge  >ARG0
of  
music  
far  >ARGM-EXT
surpassed*  
what  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
expected*  
.  

I  >ARG1
am*  
a  
music  
junkie  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
grew*  
up  
in  
the  
80's  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
my  
dad  >ARG0
worked*  
for  
a  
record  
label  <ARG2
in  
the  
1960's  <ARGM-TMP
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
we  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
expect*  
them  >ARG0
to  
even  >ARGM-ADV
know*  
some  <ARG1
of  
the  
requests*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
we  >ARG0
asked*  
that  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
really  >ARGM-EXT
know*  
their  
stuff  <ARG1
!  

NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
fear*  
going*  
to  
the  
dentist  <ARG4
again  <<ARGM-TMP
!  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
61  
years  >ARG2
old*  
and  
have*  
dental  
problems  <ARG1
my  
entire  
life  <ARGM-TMP
.  

By  
the  
age  >ARGM-TMP
of  
24  
I  >>ARG0
stopped*  
going*  
to  
the  
dentist  <ARG4
.  

My  >ARG0
fear*  >>ARG0
and  
discomfort  
from  
dental  >ARG1
work*  
scared*  
me  <ARG1
!  

It  >ARG0
took*  
all  
the  
courage  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
muster*  
to  
make*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
appointment*  
.  

At  
the  
front  
door  >ARGM-LOC
of  
his  
office  
,  
I  >ARG0
nearly  >ARGM-ADV
turned*  
around  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >>ARG0
considered*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
leaving*  
after  
going*  
inside  <ARG4
and  
nearly  
did*  
.  

Doctor  >ARG1
Gonzales  
and  
his  
entire  
staff  
are*  
the  
most  
professional  
people  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
dealt*  
with  <C-ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
made*  
me  >>ARG1
feel*  
confident*  
in  
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
,  
and  
treated*  
me  <ARG1
like  
a  
member  <ARG2
of  
their  
own  
family  
.  

I  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
felt*  
pain  <ARG1
or  
discomfort  
.  

The  
ability  >>ARG1
to  
smile*  
and  
eat*  
again  <ARGM-TMP
can  >>ARGM-MOD
only  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
described*  
as  
a  
whole  
new  
lease  <ARG2
on  
life  
.  

Thank*  
you  <ARG1
Doctor  <ARGM-DIS

HORRIBLE  >ARGM-ADJ
SERVICE*  
AND  
FOOD  

not  
only  
is*  
this  
place  >ARG1
too  >ARGM-CXN
expensive*  
for  
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
is*  
,  
it  >>ARG1
s*  
horrible*  
!  

In  
the  
past  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
got*  
a  
steak  <ARG1
and  
there  
was*  
more  
fat  <ARG1
and  
rough  
pieces  
than  
there  
was*  
good  
steak  <ARG1
(  
and  
this  >ARG1
was*  
the  
sirloin  <ARG2
!  
)  
,  
the  
sides  >>ARG1
were*  
drenched*  
with  
butter  <ARG2
and  
the  
salad  >ARG1
was*  
a  
little  
on  
the  
brown  
side  <ARG2
.  

Today  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
went*  
for  
a  
party*  
(  
during  
lunch  
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
the  
place  >ARG1
was*  
empty  <ARG2
)  
with  
about  
25  
other  
people  <<ARGM-COM
.  

It  
took*  
over  
1.5  
hours  <ARG1
for  
our  
food  >ARG1
to  
come*  
out  
and  
by  
that  
time  >ARGM-TMP
my  
8  
month  >ARG0
old  
had*  
it  <ARG1
!  

Does*  
it  >ARG0
seriously  >ARGM-ADV
take*  
that  
long  <ARG1
for  
a  
soup  <ARGM-PRP
and  
salad  
?  

I  >ARG1
was*  
a  
waitress  <ARG2
for  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
a  
key  >ARGM-ADJ
rule*  >ARG1
is*  
to  
serve*  
customers  <ARG2
with  
small  
children  
before  
others  <ARGM-TMP
,  
as  
I  >ARG1
was*  
the  
last  >ARG0
to  
get*  
my  
food  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
recommend*  
having*  
a  
party*  
here  <<ARGM-LOC
or  
even  >ARGM-ADV
going*  
here  <ARG4
.  

Texas  
Roadhouse  >>ARG1
is*  
WAY  >ARGM-EXT
better*  
!!  

Spay  >ARG1
and  
neuter  
service*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  >ARGM-LVB
no  >ARGM-NEG
doubt*  
that  
the  
rescue*  >>ARG1
is*  
wonderful*  
.  

But  
I  >ARG0
had*  
my  
cat  >ARG1
spayed*  
through  
their  
reduced  
/  
free  
spay  
and  
neuter  
program  <ARGM-MNR
and  
the  
vet  >>ARG1
they  >ARG0
sent*  
us  <ARG1
to  <C-ARG2
was*  
first  <ARGM-ADV
of  
all  
a  
hour  
and  
a  
half  
away  <ARG2
,  
and  
4  
days  
later  
we  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
bring*  
them  <ARG1
to  
our  
normal  
vet  <ARG2
because  
the  
vets  >ARG0
at  
the  
place  
in  
wisconsin  
did*  
a  
crappy  
job  <ARG1
and  
they  >>ARG1
got*  >ARGM-LVB
infections*  
.  

My  
vet  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
said*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
my  >ARG1
fault*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
the  
vet  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
did*  
the  
surgery  <ARG1
,  
So  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
recommend*  
getting*  
that  
program  <ARG1
unless  
you  >ARG0
have*  
an  
extra  
hundred  
dollars  <ARG1
or  
so  
for  
antibiotics  
and  
a  
vet  >ARG1
visit*  
.  

You  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
think*  
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
a  
good  
job  <ARG1
but  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
care*  
unless  
they  >>ARG2
are*  
getting*  
paid*  
full  >ARGM-MNR
price*  
.  

Which  >>ARG1
is*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
dumb*  
.  

Not  
to  
mention  
the  
fact  
that  
they  >ARG0
gave*  
us  <ARG2
our  
cats  <ARG1
back  <C-V
not  
even  
30  
minutes  
after  
they  >ARG1
were*  
out  <ARG2
from  
surgery  
.  

Billing  >ARG0
Issues*  
...  

I  >ARG0
had*  
a  
routine  
surgery  <ARG1
for  
an  
ingrown  
toenail  
.  

My  
insurance  
company  >ARG0
,  
Blue  
Cross  
/  
Blue  
Shield  
paid*  
the  
fees  <ARG1
and  
everything  >>ARG1
was*  
fine*  
.  

Then  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
got*  
a  
bill  <ARG1
for  
$  
483.00  
.  

The  
doctor  
's  
office  >ARG0
said*  
that  
payments*  >>ARG1
had*  
been*  
"  
reversed*  
"  
.  

Blue  
cross  >ARG0
has*  
no  
record  <ARG1
of  
aa  
reversal*  
.  

The  
office  >ARG0
refused*  
my  >ARG0
requests*  
to  
see*  
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
got*  
from  
BC  <ARG2
/  
BS  
.  

They  >>ARG0
eventually  >>ARGM-TMP
turned*  
it  <ARG1
over  <C-V
to  
a  
collection  
agency  <ARG2
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
discuss*  
the  
matter  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
eventually  >ARGM-TMP
decided*  
to  
just  >ARGM-ADV
pay*  
the  
balance  <ARG1
even  
though  
the  
doctor  >>ARG2
has*  
already  >>ARGM-TMP
been*  
paid*  
,  
but  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
collection  
agency  >>ARG0
is*  
trying*  
to  
say*  
another  
reversal*  >>ARG1
of  
$  <ARG1
160.00  
has*  
come*  
through  
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
an  
ingrown  
toenail  <ARG2
.  

How  
much  >ARG2
could  >ARGM-MOD
it  >ARG1
possibly  >ARGM-ADV
cost*  
?  

Not  
only  
am  
I  >>ARG2
being*  
bilked*  
for  
money  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
owe*  
,  
the  
office  
staff  >>ARG0
is*  
rude*  
to  
boot*  
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
this  
office  >>ARG1
has*  >ARGM-LVB
some  
serious  >ARGM-ADJ
billing  
practice  >ARG0
issues*  
!  

We  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
blessed*  
to  
find*  
Elite  
Flyers  <ARG1
online  <ARGM-LOC
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
use*  
anyone  <ARG1
else  
to  
handle*  
our  
postcards  <ARG1
,  
posters  
,  
etc  
.  

We  >>ARG0
were*  
looking*  
for  
a  
company  <ARG1
with  
decent  
rates  
as  
our  
company  >>ARG1
was*  
just  >>ARGM-TMP
getting*  
started*  
.  

They  >ARG0
have*  
the  
best  
rates  <ARG1
and  
GREAT  >ARGM-ADJ
customer  >ARG2
service*  
.  

On  
one  
order*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >ARG0
needed*  
it  >>ARG1
rushed*  
and  
shipped*  
to  
a  
different  
state  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG0
did*  
that  <ARG1
with  
no  
problem  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
appreciate*  
their  
honesty  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
sent*  
a  
graphic  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
distorted*  
if  
printed*  
as  
it  
was*  
.  

They  >>ARG0
called*  
and  
worked*  
with  
me  <ARG3
to  
fix*  
it  <ARG1
so  
that  
it  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
look*  
perfect*  
.  

They  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
surprised*  
me  <ARG1
a  
larger  >ARGM-ADJ
order*  
.  

I  >ARG0
ordered*  
1000  
postcards  <ARG1
,  
we  >ARG0
normally  >ARGM-ADV
order*  
5000  <ARG1
or  
more  
.  

Because  
they  >ARG0
had*  >>ARGM-CAU
room  >ARGM-ADV
to  
do*  
5000  <ARG1
,  
they  >>ARG0
created*  
the  
larger  
amount  <ARG1
,  
and  
shipped*  
them  <ARG1
early  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
recommend*  
this  
company  <ARG1
to  
ANYONE  >ARG0
and  
everyone  
that  >R-ARG0
needs*  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
work*  >ARGM-PRR
done*  
at  
a  
reasonable  
rate  <<ARGM-ADV
!  

They  >ARG0
have*  
a  
customer  <ARG1
for  
life  
in  
us  <ARGM-ADV
!  

sheisters  

i  >>ARG0
made*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
mistake*  
of  
buying*  
from  
these  
thieves  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
paid*  
2  
k  <ARG1
cash  <ARGM-MNR
for  
a  
truck  <ARG3
with  
a  
blown  
motor  
.  

Their  
so  
called  
mechanic  >ARG0
said*  
the  
engine  >>ARG1
was*  
good*  
and  
"  
There  
is*  
nothing  <ARG1
mechanicly  
wrong  
with  
this  
truck  
"  
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
think*  
a  
blown  
engine  >ARG1
falls*  
under  
the  
catagory  <ARG2
of  
mechanics  
right  <ARGM-DIS
?  

Anyway  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG0
jimmy  >ARGM-ADJ
rigged*  
it  <ARG1
so  
i  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
drive*  
it  <ARG1
home  <ARGM-GOL
.  

The  
next  
day  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
took*  
it  <ARG1
to  
2  
auto  
shops  <ARG3
and  
they  >ARG0
both  
told*  
me  <ARG2
the  
same  
thing  <ARG1
,  
engine  >ARG1
is*  
junk  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
called*  
and  
got*  
the  
same  
runaround  <ARG1
on  
hold*  
and  
noone  >ARG0
calls*  
you  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
.  

From  
a  
moral  
standpoint  
,  
you  
guys  >>ARG0
are*  
really  
gon*  
na  
take*  
2,000  
bucks  <ARG1
from  
someone  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
needs*  
that  
truck  <ARG1
to  
work*  
and  
support*  
his  
family  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
know*  
it  >ARG1
s*  
just  <ARGM-ADV
a  
piece  <ARG2
of  
scrap  
metal  
?  

If  
it  >ARG1
lasted*  >ARGM-ADV
1  
month  <ARG2
i  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
suck*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
but  
1  
day  
?  

Grimy  >ARGM-ADJ

My

were*

up  
in  
the  
middle  <ARGM-TMP

the  
night  
at  
our  
campsite  <ARGM-LOC
by  
drunken  
kids  >>ARG0

'd*  
arrived*  
around  
1:00  
am  <ARGM-TMP

were*  
drinking*  
at  
the  
springs  <ARGM-LOC

When  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
complained*  >>ARGM-TMP

(

to  
do*

told*

that  
it  
was*

get*  
up

building  <ARG1
,  
with  
presumably  
better  
facilities  
.  

All  
to  
the  
good  
.  

For  
those  >>ARGM-ADV
who  >R-ARG0
care*  
,  
a  
good  
proportion  >ARG0
of  
the  
my  
class  
went*  
on  <ARGM-DIR
to  
4  
-  
year  
colleges  <ARG4
,  
many  >ARG1
of  
them  
ranked*  
in  
the  
top  
50  <ARG2
of  
US  
News  
.  

If  
I  >ARG0
remember*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
students  >ARG0
went*  
to  
Dartmouth  <ARG4
,  
U.  
Penn  
,  
Duke  
,  
BU  
,  
William  
and  
Mary  
,  
Vassar  
,  
Howard  
,  
and  
Carnegie  
Mellon  
,  
among  
others  
.  

Many  
students  >ARG0
went*  
to  
Rutgers  <ARG4
,  
including  
their  >ARG0
top  >ARG2
-  
ranked*  
pharmacy  
program  <ARG1
.  

The  
point  >ARG1
is*  
--  
FHS  >ARG0
gives*  
you  <ARG2
the  
opportunity  <ARG1
to  
make*  
it  
to  
a  
good  
college  <ARG1
,  
but  
you  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
work*  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Absolutely  
the  
best  
little  
motel  
on  
the  
coast  
!  

I  >>ARG1
've*  
stayed*  
at  
this  
fabulous  
little  
motel  <ARG3
two  
years  >ARGM-TMP
running*  
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
say*  
it  >ARG1
's*  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
lodging  >ARG1
experiences*  >>ARGM-PRR
I  <ARG0
've*  
ever  <<ARGM-TMP
had*  
on  
the  
coast  <<ARGM-LOC
...  
and  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
even  >ARGM-ADV
comparing*  
it  <ARG1
to  
the  
big  
resorts  >>ARG3
I  >>ARG1
've*  
stayed*  
at  <C-ARG3
!  

A  
large  
group  >ARG0
of  
my  
friends  
and  
I  
rent*  
almost  
the  
whole  
motel  <ARG1
every  
year  <ARGM-TMP
for  
a  
weekend  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
the  
experience*  >>ARG1
and  
stay*  
have*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
been*  
five  
-  
star  <ARG2
.  

The  
rooms  >>ARG1
are*  
SO  >ARGM-EXT
clean*  
,  
the  
managers  >ARG1
/  
owners  
are*  
the  
nicest  
people  <ARG2
,  
the  
place  >ARG1
feels*  
so  
homey  <ARG2
,  
and  
the  
location  >>ARG1
and  
grounds  
are*  
beautiful*  
.  

There  
's*  
a  
restaurant  <ARG1
nearby  
(  
walking  
distance  
)  
with  
a  
great  
breakfast  
,  
and  
a  
market  
across  
the  
street  
.  

The  
motel  >ARG1
is*  
very  
well  
maintained  <ARG2
,  
and  
the  
managers  >ARG1
are*  
so  
accomodating  <ARG2
,  
it  >ARG1
's*  
kind  
of  
like  
visiting*  
family  <ARG1
each  
year  <ARGM-TMP
!  
;-)  

I  >ARG0
honestly  >ARGM-ADV
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
rave*  
enough  <ARGM-EXT
about  
this  
place  <ARG1
...  
it  >ARG1
's*  
really  <ARGM-ADV
a  
hidden  
gem  <ARG2
worth  
checking*  
out  
!  

My  
favorite  
cuban  
cafe  
in  
Orlando  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
eating*  
Cuban  <ARG1
for  
a  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
sandwiches  
mainly  
along  
with  
other  
dishes  
..  

I  >ARG0
love*  
Cuban  
coffee  <ARG1
,  
colada  
...  
mmmm  
anyways  
I  >>ARG0
found*  
this  
place  <ARG1
and  
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
stop*  
going*  
there  <ARG4
,  
I  >ARG0
stop*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
at  
least  
once  <ARGM-TMP
a  
week  
and  
anytime  
I  >ARG1
'm*  
in  
the  
area  <ARG2
for  
a  
Cuban  
coffee  <<ARGM-PRP
or  
snack  
.  

The  
place  >>ARG1
is*  
chill*  
and  
comfortable  
.  

They  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
speak*  
the  
best  
English  <ARG1
but  
enough  
to  
get*  
by  
.  

They  >ARG0
bake*  
bread  <ARG1
fresh  <ARGM-PRD
daily  <ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
press*  
their  
sandwiches  <ARG1
which  >ARG1
is*  
the  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
I  >ARG0
like*  
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
the  
meat  >>ARG1
is*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
fresh*  
.  

They  >ARG0
have*  
a  
great  
lunch  
special  <ARG1
with  
your  >ARG0
choice*  
of  
meat  <ARG1
,  
chicken  <ARG2
,  
steak  <ARG2
,  
or  
pork  <ARG2
and  
rice  
and  
black  
beans  
and  
fried  
plantains  
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
their  
breakfast  >>ARG0
is*  
awesome*  
!!  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
describe*  
how  
delicious  <ARG1
the  
mango  
and  
cheese  
pastries  
and  
the  
omelets  >ARG1
are*  
to  
die*  
for  <ARG1
.  

Stop*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
and  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
bite*  
you  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
regret*  
it  <ARG1
.  

A  
slice  
of  
heaven  
in  
winter  
park  
off  
forsyth  
!  

highly  
recommended  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
going*  
to  
Warner  
Family  <ARG4
for  
a  
number  <ARGM-TMP
of  
years  
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
it  <ARG1
to  
anyone  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
read*  
some  <ARG1
of  
the  
reviews*  
below  <ARGM-LOC
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
state*  
that  
yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
like  
any  
other  
doctor  
s  
office  >ARGM-ADV
there  
is*  
sometimes  <ARGM-TMP
a  
wait  <ARG1
(  
depending  
on  
what  >>ARGM-PRP
other  
patients  >>ARG1
are*  
being*  
seen*  
for  <C-ARGM-PRP
)  
and  
some  >>ARG1
of  
the  
tests*  >>ARG1
and  
procedures*  
that  >>R-ARG1
are*  
ran*  
can  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
costly  <ARG2
(  
just  
like  
they  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
for  
any  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
medical  >ARGM-ADJ
tests*  
elsewhere  <<ARGM-LOC
if  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
insurance  <ARG1
)  
...  

I  >>ARG2
have*  
seen*  
several  <ARG1
of  
the  
providers  
from  
the  
office  
and  
have*  
not  >>ARGM-NEG
once  >>ARGM-TMP
been*  
shown*  
anything  <ARG1
but  
care*  
and  
consideration*  
.  

I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
speak*  
for  
them  <ARGM-PRP
but  
any  
tests*  >>ARG1
or  
appointments*  
they  >ARG0
recommend*  
are*  
probably  <ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
interests*  
of  
us  <ARG1
(  
the  
patient  
)  
and  
you  >>ARG0
have*  
the  
ability  <ARG1
to  
decline*  
anything  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
they  >ARG0
suggest*  
to  
you  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
personally  >>ARGM-ADV
have*  
had*  
wonderful  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
and  
if  
you  >>ARG0
re*  >>ARGM-ADV
truely  >ARGM-ADV
looking*  
for  
a  
FAMILY  
practice  <ARG1
...  
Warner  
Family  >ARG1
is*  
the  
place  <ARG2
for  
you  
.  

Not  
what  >ARG1
i  >ARG0
expected*  
!  

We  >ARG0
read*  
the  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
reviews*  
before  
going*  
and  
had*  >ARGM-LVB
high  >ARGM-MNR
hopes*  
..  
but  
to  
our  
dismay  >>ARGM-ADV
it  >>ARG1
did*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
turn*  
out  
that  
way*  
!  

~  
It  >>ARG1
took*  
over  
40  
mins  <ARG1
to  
be*  
taken*  
to  
our  
table  <ARG3
,  
once  
there  >ARGM-TMP
it  
took*  
another  
20  
mins  <ARG1
to  
get*  
our  >ARG0
orders*  
and  
a  
further  
45  
mins  
till  
our  
starters  >ARG1
landed*  
on  
our  
table  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Very  
frustrating  
for  
a  
restaurant  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
has*  
1  
rosette  <ARG1
and  
is*  
supposedly  <ARGM-ADV
renowned  <ARG2
for  
the  
service*  
...  
hmm  
There  
was*  
no  
canape's  >ARG0
or  
amuse  
to  
keep*  
us  <ARG1
occupied  <ARG2
,  
once  
we  >ARG0
complained*  >ARGM-TMP
about  
the  
wait  <ARG1
they  >ARG0
took*  
us  <ARG3
something  >ARG1
to  
nibble*  
on  <C-ARG1
but  
that  >ARG0
took*  
us  >>ARG0
getting*  
out  <ARGM-PRD
our  
chairs  <ARG1
and  
wondering*  
round  <ARG1
to  
do*  
that  <ARG1
and  
it  
was*  
impossible*  
to  
get*  
anyone  >ARG0
s  
attention*  
.  

Scallops  >ARG1
were*  
overcooked  <ARG2
and  
the  
foie  
gras  >>ARG1
was*  
cold*  
but  
the  
rest  >>ARG1
of  
the  
food  
was*  
lovely*  
.  

On  
top  >ARGM-ADV
of  
that  
though  >ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
tried*  
to  
charge*  
us  <ARG2
service  >ARG3
charge*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
to  
rub*  
it  <ARG1
it  <ARGM-PRD
....  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
as  
there  
are*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
places  
A  
LOT  
better  
and  
cheaper  
.  

Nice  >ARGM-ADJ
selection*  
,  
very  
clean  
,  
friendly  
staff  
!  

Hot  
Iron  >>ARG1
has*  
become*  
a  
favorite  <ARG2
of  
our  
family  
.  

Everyone  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
get*  
the  
signature  
dish  <ARG1
with  
ingredients  >ARG1
and  
spices  
that  >R-ARG1
they  >ARG0
want*  
and  
have*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
fun*  
of  
watching*  
it  >ARG1
cook*  
.  

The  
staff  >>ARG1
are*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
friendly*  
and  
conscientious  
.  

They  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
ask*  
if  
you  >ARG0
have*  
meat  <ARG1
in  
your  
dish  <ARGM-LOC
,  
(  
for  
vegetarians  <<ARGM-GOL
like  
me  
)  
,  
they  >>ARG0
scrub*  
an  
area  <ARG1
of  
the  
grill  
and  
use*  
separate  
utensils  <ARG1
to  
cook*  
.  

They  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
just  >>ARGM-ADV
dump*  
your  
ingredients  <ARG1
on  <ARGM-PRD
and  
cook*  
either  <ARGM-ADV
,  
but  
carefully  >ARGM-MNR
separate*  
meat  <ARG1
to  
the  
hotter  
parts  <ARGM-DIR
of  
the  
grill  
and  
still  >ARGM-TMP
manage*  
to  
keep*  
the  
veggies  >ARG1
from  
turning*  
to  
mush  <ARG2
.  

The  
selection*  >>ARG0
of  
meats  <ARG1
,  
veggies  
and  
sauces  
is*  
awesome*  
too  <ARGM-DIS
!  

Every  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
go*  
they  >>ARG0
seem*  
to  
have*  
a  
different  
ingredient  >ARG0
or  
two  
which  >R-ARG0
keeps*  
things  >ARG0
interesting*  
.  

Meats  >>ARG1
are*  
kept*  
VERY  >ARGM-EXT
cold*  
,  
seafood  >>ARG1
smells*  
fresh*  
and  
the  
serving  
bar  >>ARG1
is*  
VERY  >ARGM-EXT
clean*  
.  

Prices*  >>ARG1
are*  
reasonable*  
,  
(  
Kid  
s  
meals  >ARG1
are*  
around  
4.99  <ARG2
)  
and  
Wednesday's  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
have*  
discount  >ARG2
dinner  >ARG1
prices*  
,  
I  >ARG0
believe*  
.  

Great  
Cookies  
,  
Cakes  
,  
and  
Customer  >ARG2
Service*  

It  >ARG1
was*  
my  
birthday  <ARG2
and  
I  >ARG0
had*  
a  
last  
minute  
idea  <ARG1
to  
have*  
a  
bakery  
cake  <ARG1
instead  
of  
one  >ARG1
pre-made*  
in  
a  
convenience  
store  <ARGM-LOC
,  
but  
the  
problem  >ARG1
was*  
it  >ARG1
was*  
the  
day  <ARG2
before  
Valentine  
s  
and  
when  >ARGM-TMP
many  
bakeries  >ARG0
turned*  >>ARGM-TMP
me  <ARG1
down  <C-V
for  
a  
plain  
vanilla  
rectangle  
cake  <ARGM-PRP
,  
Fiona  >>ARG0
stepped*  
up  <ARGM-DIR
to  
the  
plate  <ARG2
and  
was*  
able*  
to  
make*  
a  
fantastic  
beautiful  
cake  <ARG1
.  

Not  
only  
did  
it  >>ARG1
taste*  
wonderful*  
,  
but  
the  
texture  >>ARG1
was*  
unbelievable*  
,  
the  
frosting  >>ARG1
was*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
overly  >ARGM-EXT
sweet*  
to  
over  
power*  
the  
cake  <ARG1
,  
and  
the  
cake  >>ARG1
itself  
was*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
amazingly  >ARGM-EXT
soft*  
,  
and  
fluffy  
,  
and  
just  >ARGM-ADV
perfect*  
overall  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Although  
I  >>ARG0
'll  
have*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
drive*  
a  
little  
out  
of  
my  >ARG0
way*  
to  
go*  
there  <ARG4
,  
I  >>ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
gladly  >ARGM-ADV
do*  
it  <ARG1
knowing*  
that  
since  
she  >>ARG0
's*  
been*  
astounding*  >ARGM-CAU
to  
me  <ARG1
once  <ARGM-TMP
before  
that  <ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG1
'll  >ARGM-MOD
always  >ARGM-TMP
be*  
that  
way*  
!  

(  
Also  >ARGM-DIS
she  >ARG0
has*  
a  
really  
great  
website  <ARG1
!  

And  
we  >ARG0
bought*  
a  
few  
cookies  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
too  <ARGM-DIS
,  
they  >>ARG1
were*  
fantastic*  
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
!  
)  

She  >ARG0
deserves*  
many  >ARGM-ADJ
5  
star  >ARGM-ADJ

hurt*  
very  
little  <ARGM-EXT
,  
felt*  
more  
like  
pressure  <ARG2
than  
pain  
.  

What  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
like*  
most  <ARGM-EXT
about  
Dr.  <ARGM-ADV
Liau  
is*  
that  
she  >ARG1
is*  
very  
caring  <ARG2
.  

She  >ARG0
talks*  
to  
you  <ARG2
at  
each  
appointment*  
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
tell*  
she  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
cares*  
and  
wants*  
to  
help*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
SO  >ARGM-EXT
GLAD*  
to  
have*  
found*  
Dr.  <ARG1
Liau  
.  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
feel*  
more  >ARGM-EXT
confident*  
wearing*  
my  
bathing  
suit  <ARG1
in  
the  
summer  <ARGM-TMP

An  
Asset  
to  
Richmond  

For  
a  
long  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
one  
big  
source  >>ARG1
of  
entertainment  
missing  
from  
the  
Richmond  >ARG1
City  >ARG1
Limits*  
was*  
a  
first  >ARGM-TMP
-  
run*  
multiplex  <<ARG2
.  

Bowtie  >>ARG2
has*  
filled*  
that  
role  <ARG1
nicely  <ARGM-MNR
.  

The  
theatre  >ARG1
is*  
in  
an  
old  
brick  
warehouse  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
is*  
a  
block  
away  <ARG2
from  
the  
Flying  
Squirrels  
stadium  
.  

The  
owners  >>ARG0
of  
Bowtie  
manged*  
to  
add*  
something  <ARG1
new  
while  
preserving*  
what  >ARG1
was*  
already  <ARGM-TMP
there  <ARG2
.  

The  
theatre  >>ARG0
has*  
greatly  >ARGM-EXT
improved*  
the  
surrounding  
neighborhood  <ARG1
.  

There  
's*  
plenty  <ARG1
of  
parking*  
,  
and  
I  >>ARG1
've*  
never  >>ARGM-NEG
had*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
issue*  
with  
audience  
members  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
stop*  
talking*  
or  
answering*  
their  
cellphones  <ARG1
.  

Best  >ARGM-ADV
of  
all  
,  
there  
are*  
no  
ads  <ARG1
!!!!  
!  

Just  
previews  
and  
the  
main  
feature  
.  

Expect*  
to  
pay*  
full  >ARGM-EXT
price*  
,  
and  
the  
theatres  >ARG1
themselves  
are*  
on  
the  
small  
side  <ARG2
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
if  
you  >>ARG0
like*  >>ARGM-ADV
going*  
to  
the  
movies  <ARG4
,  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
love*  
Bowtie  <ARG1
.  

The  
mangers  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
play*  
a  
classic  
movies  <ARG1
on  
Sundays  <ARGM-TMP
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
a  
beer  <ARG1
in  
the  
lobby  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
repeat  
customers  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
discounts*  
if  
they  >ARG0
have*  
a  
member  
card  <ARG1
.  

A  
great  
cinema  
in  
a  
great  
location  
.  

Thank*  
you  <ARG1

History  

My  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-ADJ
visit*  >>ARG1
was*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
fun*  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
stayed*  
all  
day  <ARGM-TMP

not  >ARGM-NEG
seen*  
all

I  >>ARG0

got*

By

the  
2010  
Genesis  >ARG1

grrrrrrrreeeaaat  <ARG2
!  

I  >ARG1
am*  
a  
proud  
owner  <ARG2
of  
a  
brand  
new  
2010  
Hyundai  
Genesis  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
seen*  
this  
car  <ARG1
before  <ARGM-TMP
until  
this  
lady  >ARG0
at  
wal  
mart  
had*  
it  <ARG1
and  
she  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
she  >ARG0
got*  
it  <ARG1
here  <ARGM-LOC
and  
that  
everyone  >>ARG1
was*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
nice*  
to  
her  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
asked*  
her  <ARG2
who  >ARG3
she  >ARG0
worked*  
with  <C-ARG3
and  
she  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
told*  
me  <ARG2
ti  >ARG1
was*  
the  
sales  
manager  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
took*  
the  
weekend  <ARG1
off  <C-V
and  
came*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
and  
asked*  
for  
the  
manager  >ARG1
who  >R-ARG1
is*  
Jeff  <ARG2
and  
he  >>ARG0
remembered*  
her  <ARG1
right  
away  <ARGM-TMP
even  >ARGM-ADV
remembered*  
her  
dog  <ARG1
,  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
a  
bit  >ARGM-EXT
shocked*  
that  
someone  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
pay*  >ARGM-LVB
that  
close  >ARGM-ADJ
attention*  
.  

We  
got*  
to  
talking*  
and  
he  >ARG0
got*  
me  >ARG1
set*  
up  
and  
I  >ARG0
test  >ARGM-PRP
drove*  
with  
Craig  <ARGM-COM
and  
I  >ARG1
fell*  
head  <ARG2
over  
heels  
for  
this  
car  <ARGM-MNR
all  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
kept*  
saying*  
,  
"  
was*  
I  >>ARG0
got*  
ta  
have*  
it  <ARG1
!  
"  

I  >ARG0
thouhgt*  
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
out  
of  
my  
price  
range  <ARG2
but  
they  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
worked*  
with  
me  <ARG3
and  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
nt  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
happier*  
.  

Jeff  >>ARG0
and  
Craig  
are*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
good*  
at  
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
do*  
and  
know*  
exactly  
how  >ARG2
to  
treat*  
a  
customer  <ARG1
.  

Definitely  >ARGM-ADV
go*  
see*  
them  <ARG1

Bait  
and  
switch*  
,  
untrained  
workers  

Called*  
the  
Bonanza  
store  <ARG1
2  
weeks  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
,  
before  
I  >ARG0
ripped*  
out  
350  
sq  
ft  <ARG1
of  
ceramic  
tile  
...  
was*  
told*  
I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
a  
"  
dual  
head  
concrete  
grinder  <ARG1
"  
to  
remove*  
thinset  <ARG1
and  
make*  
a  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
finished  >ARGM-PRD
"  
look*  
(  
ready  <ARGM-ADJ
for  
concrete  
stain  
)  
.  

Was*  
quoted*  
$  <ARG1
55  
all  
inclusive  
of  
grinder  
inserts  
,  
etc  
.  

No  
problem  
,  
sounded*  
like  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
done*  
every  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Will  >>ARGM-MOD
look*  
beautiful*  
.  

Got*  
the  
tile  >ARG1
ripped*  
out  
,  
call*  
today  <ARGM-TMP
,  
now  >ARGM-TMP
all  
the  
sudden  >ARGM-TMP
this  
grinder  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
leave*  
a  
finished  >ARGM-PRD
look*  
AND  
it  >ARG1
's*  
$  <ARG2
125  
PLUS  
around  
$  
75  
for  
the  
inserts  
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
rent*  
another  
machine  >ARG0
for  
like  
$  <ARG3
60  
that  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
give*  
it  <ARG2
a  
finished  >ARGM-PRD
look*  
.  

So  
from  
$  
55  
to  
$  
260  
?  

Are*  
they  >ARG1
serious*  
?  

I  >ARG0
feel*  
like  
they  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tell*  
me  <ARG2
the  
pitfalls  <ARG1
before  
I  >ARG0
pulled*  
out  <ARG2
this  
tile  <ARG1
and  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
that  
I  >ARG0
have*  
no  
other  
options  <ARG1
they  >ARG0
want*  
5  
TIMES  >ARGM-EXT
the  
price*  
?  

Either  
these  
people  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
anything  <ARG1
about  
what  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
renting*  
,  
or  
worse*  >>ARGM-ADV
-  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
bait*  
and  
switching*  
.  

One  >ARG0
suspects*  
that  
earlier  
reviewer  >ARG0
works*  
for  
another  
laundry  <ARG2
.  

Outside  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
parking*  >ARG1
being*  
at  
a  
premium  <ARG2
,  
especially  
on  
discount  
days  <ARGM-TMP
,  
The  
Laundry  
Tub  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
filthy  <ARG2
and  
it  >>ARG1
's*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
smaller*  
than  
any  <ARGM-CXN
of  
a  
dozen  
laundromats  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG1
've*  
been*  
in  <C-ARG2
.  

Yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
there  >>ARG1
are*  
bigger*  
,  
but  
bigger  >>ARG1
is*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
necessarily  >ARGM-ADV
better*  
.  

I  >ARG0
availed*  
myself  <ARG1
of  
the  
wash*  >>ARG1
'n  
fold*  
service*  
,  
taking*  
just  
about  
a  
year  
's  
worth  <ARG1
of  
dirty  
clothes  
in  <ARGM-DIR
and  
getting*  
back  
neatly  >ARGM-MNR
folded*  
,  
clean  
clothes  <ARG2
in  
clear  
plastic  
bags  
(  
I  >>ARG0
'd*  
originally  >ARGM-ADV
brought*  
them  <ARG1
in  <ARG3
,  
in  
six  
large  
yellow  
garbage  
bags  <ARGM-MNR
)  
.  

The  
cost  >>ARG1
was*  
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
reasonable*  
and  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
continue*  
my  >ARG0
patronage*  
of  
The  
Laundry  
Tub  <ARG1
in  
the  
future  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hurt*  
any  <ARGM-EXT
that  
they  >>ARG0
knew*  
my  
name  <ARG1
by  
my  >ARG0
second  >ARGM-ADJ
visit*  
and  
greeted*  
me  <ARG1
warmly  <ARG3
then  <ARGM-TMP
and  
on  
my  >ARG0
third  >ARGM-ADJ
visit*  
.  

Whereas  
my  >ARG0
answer*  
to  
the  
question*  
"  
Where  >>ARGM-LOC
do*  
you  >ARG0
get*  
your  
laundry  >>ARG1

at  
WalMart  
,  
"  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
honestly  >ARGM-MNR
say*  
the  
answer*  >ARG1
now  >ARGM-TMP
is*  
,  
"  
At  
The  
Laundry  
Tub  <ARG2

"  

Thank*  
you  <ARG1
!  

I  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
took*  
a  
rescue  
puppy  <ARG1
to  
this  
Clinic  <ARG3
and  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
SHOCKED*  
at  
how  
well  >>ARGM-MNR
Romeo  >>ARG1
and  
My  
family  
was*  
treated*  
.  

They  >>ARG0
worked*  
around  
the  
clock  <ARGM-TMP
to  
ensure*  
that  
my  
puppy  
life  >>ARG1
was*  
saved*  
.  

We  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
leave*  
him  <ARG1
at  
the  
vet  <ARG2
for  
3  
days  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
told*  
to  
call*  
for  
check  
ups*  
as  
often  <<ARGM-TMP
as  
I  >ARG0
wished*  
that  
no  
matter  >>ARGM-ADV
how  
many  
times  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
called*  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
annoy*  
them  <ARG1
.  

lol  >>ARGM-DIS
They  >>ARG0
where*  
super  >ARGM-EXT
friendly*  
towards  
us  <ARG2
and  
treated*  
us  <ARG1
like  
people  <ARG2
not  
walking*  
bags  <ARG0
of  
cash  
.  

In  
this  
day  >>ARGM-TMP
it  
s*  
rare*  
to  
find*  
such  
wonderful  
people  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
CARE*  
,  
Not  
the  
kind  
of  
want*  
to  
make*  
cash  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
strongly  >ARGM-MNR
suggest*  
you  >ARG0
give*  
them  <ARG2
the  
chance*  
to  
prove*  
to  
you  <ARG2
that  
not  
all  
people  >>ARG0
in  
this  
world  
are*  
evil*  
!  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
to  
another  
vet  <ARG4
as  
long  <ARGM-TMP
as  
I  >ARG0
have*  
animals  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
live*  
nearly  
two  
hours  
away  <ARGM-LOC
and  
yet  
I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
still  >>ARGM-TMP
make*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
drive*  
to  
see*  
them  <ARG1
!  

In  
fact  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
look*  
forward  
to  
taking*  
my  
animals  <ARG1
to  
the  
vet  <ARG3
simply  
because  
of  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
my  
animals  >>ARG1
and  
I  
are*  
treated*  
.  

Okay  >ARGM-DIS
,  
here  >ARG2
's*  
the  
scoop  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG1
'm*  
a  
regular  <ARG2
at  
the  
HH  
.  

The  
food  >>ARG1
is*  
excellent*  
,  
the  
serivce  >>ARG1
is*  
horrible*  
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
they  >ARG1
're*  
still  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
mindset  <ARG2
from  
when  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
was*  
only  
smokers  >>ARG0
sitting*  
around  <ARG2
and  
drinking*  
...  
not  
in  
any  
hurry*  
.  

In  
my  >ARG0
experience*  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
food  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
excellent*  
(  
for  
the  
most  
part  <ARGM-ADV
)  
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
bartenders  >>ARG0
/  
waitresses  
definately  >ARGM-ADV
need*  
to  
be*  
re-trained*  
(  
if  
they  >ARG0
ever  >ARGM-ADV
had*  
any  <ARG1
to  
begin*  
with  <ARG2

and  
learn*  
two  
things  <ARG1
:  
only  >ARGM-ADV
chat*  
with  
customers  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
other  
customers  >>ARG1
are*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
impatiently  >ARGM-ADV
waiting*  
and  
to  
look*  
around  <ARGM-DIR
more  
often  <ARGM-TMP
to  
see*  
if  
people  >>ARG1
are*  
waiting*  
.  

In  
some  
cases*  >ARGM-ADV
the  
result  >ARG1
is*  
because  
of  
understaffing*  
,  
in  
some  
cases*  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
staff  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
does*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
care*  
/  
know*  
better  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-ADV
get*  
something  >ARG0
to  
keep*  
take  
-  
out  >ARG1
warm*  
,  
so  
it  >ARG1
's*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
room  
temperature  <ARG2
at  
best  <ARGM-ADV
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
get*  
it  <ARG1
home  <ARG2
.  

You  >>ARG0
just  
have*  
to  
know*  
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
're*  
getting*  
into  <C-ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
go*  
.  

Nice  
local  
pub  
,  
excellent  
food  
(  
especially  
wings  
)  
,  
and  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
if  
you  >ARG0
have*  
a  
limited  
amount  <ARG1
of  
time  
.  

Trust*  
The  
Midas  >ARG0
Touch*  

I  >ARG0
personally  >ARGM-ADV
trust*  
this  
Midas  
store  <ARG2
with  
all  
my  
vehicles  <ARG1
,  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
going*  
there  <ARG4
for  
years  <ARGM-TMP
&  
would  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
anywhere  <ARG4
else  
!  

the  
staff  >>ARG0
is*  
very  
personable  <ARG2
&  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
care*  
about  
the  
customers  
safety  <ARG1
rather  
than  
taking*  
there  
money  <ARG1
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
however  <ARGM-ADV
a  
very  
busy  
shop  <ARG2
but  
there  
are*  
appointments*  
available  <ARGM-ADJ
&  
the  
staff  >ARG0
up  
front  
will  >ARGM-MOD
surely  >ARGM-ADV
make*  
sure*  
you  >ARG1
get*  
back  
in  
a  
timely  
manner  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >>ARG0
look*  
at  
some  <ARG1
of  
these  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
comments*  
&  
laugh*  
because  
people  >ARG0
think*  
that  
the  
world  >ARG1
revolves*  
around  
them  <ARG2
!  

Like  
the  
girl  
with  
the  
fuse  
problem  
...  

Midas  >ARG0
has*  
the  
most  
high  
tech  
equipment  <ARG1
in  
town  
&  
I  >ARG0
guarantee*  
you  <ARG2
if  
they  >ARG0
told*  >>ARGM-ADV
you  <ARG2
it  >ARG1
was*  
electrical  <ARG2
then  >ARGM-ADV
in  
deed  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
s*  
electrical  <ARG2
!  

maybe  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
understand*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
the  
world  >ARG1
works*  
&  
realize*  
you  >ARG1
are*  
just  
like  
any  
other  
person  <ARG2
&  
not  >ARGM-NEG
put*  
yourself  <ARG1
on  
a  
pedestal  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
continue*  
going*  
to  
Dave  <ARG4
at  
Midas  
because  
he  >ARG1
is*  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
most  
honest  
business  
owners  
in  
this  
town  
!  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
having*  
your  
car  >ARG1
worked*  
on  <C-ARG1
you  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
trust*  
the  
mechanic  <ARG1
&  
this  
Midas  >ARG1
is*  
truly  <ARGM-ADV
someone  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
trust*  
!  

We  >>ARG0
decided*  
to  
try*  
this  
place  <ARG1
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
because  
we  >ARG0
noticed*  
that  
it  >ARG0
had*  
some  
interesting  
things  <ARG1
on  
the  
menu  <ARGM-LOC
aside  <ARGM-ADV
from  
the  
usual  >ARGM-ADJ
rolls*  
--  
live  
scallop  
sashimi  <<C-ARG1
,  
duck  
breast  
nigiri  
with  
foie  
gras  
,  
panko  
mussels  
--  
but  
none  >>ARG1
of  
these  
were*  
particularly  >ARGM-ADV
great*  
or  
worth*  
the  
sticker  >ARGM-ADJ
price*  
.  

Additionally  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
tried*  
the  
Logan  
Circle  >ARGM-ADJ
roll*  
,  
spicy  >ARGM-ADJ
crab  >ARG1
and  
tuna  
roll*  
,  
and  
sweet  
potato  
tempura  >ARG1
roll*  
(  
$  
15  
,  
$  
10  
,  
and  
$  
3.75  
respectively  
)  
.  

The  
sweet  
potato  
tempura  >ARG1
roll*  >ARG1
was*  
actually  <ARGM-ADV
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
surprise*  
:  
cheap  
and  
delicious  
,  
the  
only  
thing  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
tried*  
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
was*  
well  
worth  <ARG2
it  
and  
a  
great  
value  
(  
and  
I  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
vegetarian  >ARGM-ADJ
rolls*  
)  
.  

The  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
rolls*  >>ARG1
were*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
at  
all  >ARGM-EXT
special*  
,  
especially  
given  <ARGM-ADV
their  >ARG1
pricing*  
.  

The  
bottom  
line  >ARG1
is*  
that  
the  
food  >>ARG1
is*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
great*  
and  
is*  
relatively  
high  
-  
priced  <ARG2
.  

The  
service*  >ARG1
is*  
solicitous  <ARG2
,  
the  
atmosphere  >>ARG1
is*  
nice*  
and  
mod  
except  
the  
out  
-  
of  
-  
place  
flat  
-  
screen  
TV  >ARG0
playing*  
football  <ARG1
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
elsewhere  <ARG4
unless  
the  
prices*  >>ARG1
are*  
cut*  
.  

It  >>ARG1
's*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG
worth*  
it  <ARG2
.  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
Expect*  
Sleep  <ARG1
or  
Courtesy  

I  >>ARG2
was*  
booked*  
for  
2  
nights  <ARGM-TMP
at  
this  
hotel  
in  
Oct  <ARGM-TMP
2007  
.  

At  
3:15  
am  >ARGM-TMP
on  
night  
#  >ARGM-TMP
2  
,  
the  
fire  
alarm  >ARG1
and  
strobe  
light  
activated*  
in  
my  
room  <ARGM-LOC
.  

These  >ARG1
are*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
household  
type  
alarms  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
sound*  >ARGM-TMP
off  
,  
it  >ARG1
is*  
a  
true  >ARGM-ADJ
audio  
/  
visual  >ARG1
experience*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
called*  
the  
front  
desk  <ARG1
and  
got*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
answer*  
.  

After  
checking*  >>ARGM-TMP
for  
signs*  
of  
fire*  
or  
smoke  
and  
seeing*  
none  <ARG1
,  
I  >>ARG0
decided*  
to  
just  >ARGM-ADV
pack*  
up  
and  
leave*  
.  

The  
desk  
agent  >>ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
argued*  
with  
me  <ARG1
,  
claiming*  
that  
no  
such  
alarm  >>ARG1
had*  
gone*  
off  
(  
as  
if  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
make*  
that  <ARG1
up  <C-V
?  
)  
.  

He  >ARG0
finally  >ARGM-TMP
admitted*  
that  
only  
the  
4  
ADA  
room  
alarms  >>ARG1
had*  
sounded*  
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
only  
4  
guests  >>ARG1
were*  
effected*  
(  
no  >ARGM-NEG
big  >ARGM-ADJ
deal*  
to  
him  <ARGM-GOL
)  
.  

This  
little  
drip  >>ARG0
offered*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
apologies*  
whatsoever  <ARGM-ADV
,  
and  
even  >ARGM-ADV
refused*  
to  
give*  
me  <ARG2
the  
name  <ARG1
of  
the  
manager  
until  
I  >ARG0
pressed*  
him  <ARG1
for  
it  <ARG2
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
.  

This  
hotel  >>ARG1
is*  
adequate*  >ARG2
enough*  
,  
but  
there  
is*  
an  
obvious  
problem  <ARG1
with  
the  
staff  
and  
management*  
.  

Do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
there  <ARG4
if  
you  >>ARG0
expect*  
to  
sleep*  
through  
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Poor  >ARGM-ADJ
Service*  
,  
Lack*  
of  
Passion  <ARG1
:  
Do*  
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
go*  

I  >>ARG0
began*  
seeing*  
Dr.  <ARG1
Romanick  
back  
in  
2000  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
have*  
seen*  
a  
significant  
decline  <ARG1
in  
the  
quality  
of  
care*  
,  
patient  
-  
doctor  >ARG0
communication*  
,  
and  
just  
the  
overall  
level  
of  
services*  
.  

The  
poor  
quality  >>ARG0
starts*  
at  
the  
receptionist  
desk  >>ARGM-LOC
,  
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
the  
staff  >>ARG1
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
impatient*  
and  
lack*  
the  
efficiency  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
once  >ARGM-TMP
loved*  
about  
the  
office  <ARGM-ADV
.  

It  
took*  
them  >ARG0
nearly  
two  
months  <ARG1
to  
complete*  
a  
simple  >ARGM-ADJ
task*  
,  
and  
countless  >ARGM-ADJ
calls*  
from  
my  
part  <ARG0
due  
to  
their  >ARG0
lack*  
of  
response*  
and  
passion  
(  
not  
that  
it  >ARG1
's*  
a  
requirement*  
for  
the  
job  <ARG0
,  
but  
it  
helps*  
to  
at  >ARGM-ADV
least  
pretend*  
to  
be*  
helpful*  
)  
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
promised*  
to  
have*  
my  
test  
results  >ARG1
emailed*  
to  
me  <ARG2
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
happened*  
,  
and  
after  
a  
few  >ARGM-ADJ
attempts*  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
get*  
Dr.  >ARG0
Romanick  
on  
the  
phone  <ARGM-MNR
to  
brief*  
me  <ARG1
on  
my  
condition  <ARG2
,  
I  >>ARG0
finally  >>ARGM-TMP
gave*  
up  
and  
went*  
to  
a  
different  
doctor  <ARG4
.  

Please  >>ARGM-DIS
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
there  <ARG4
if  
it  >ARG1
's*  
professional  >ARGM-MNR
,  
friendly  >ARGM-MNR
,  
diligent  >ARGM-MNR
medical  >ARG1
services*  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
're*  
looking*  
for  <C-ARG1
.  

Save*  
yourself  <ARG2
the  
trouble  <ARG1
,  
money  
and  
time  
and  
visit*  
a  
more  
caring  
facility  <ARG1
/  
doctor  
.  

The  
moving  
company  >>ARG1
is*  
actualy  >ARGM-ADV
based*  
in  
Brooklyn  <ARGM-LOC
,  
but  
advertised*  
all  
over  
NY  <ARGM-LOC
/  
NJ  
,  
including  
Fort  
Lee  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
the  
guys  >ARG1
arrived*  >>ARGM-TMP
(  
2  
hours  
later  <ARGM-TMP
than  
agreed*  
)  
they  >ARG0
told*  
that  
you  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
pay*  
all  
the  
tolls  >ARG1
they  >>ARG1
payed*  
coming*  
from  
Brooklyn  <ARG3
and  
extra  
$  >ARGM-ADV
100  
for  
them  >ARG0
to  
drive*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
from  
your  
destination  
.  

That  >ARG1
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
in  
agreement*  
eather  <<ARGM-ADV
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
realy  >ARGM-ADV
demand*  
it  <ARG1
.  

And  
another  
$  
100  
for  
wrapping*  
the  
furniture  <ARG1
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
totalling*  
$  <ARG2
212  
just  
for  
start*  
before  
any  
work*  >ARG1
started*  
.  

Guess*  
what  <ARG1
,  
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
in  
the  
initial  >ARGM-TMP
agreement*  
as  <<ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

I  >>ARG1
was*  
moving*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
from  
2  
bdr  
apartment  <ARGM-DIR
and  
it  >ARG0
took*  
for  
3  
strong  
guys  <ARG2
6  
hours  <ARG1
to  
load*  
a  
track  <ARG1
(  
from  
2  
pm  <<ARGM-TMP
-  
8  
pm  
)  
.  

The  
only  
reason  >>ARGM-CAU
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
giving*  
3  
stars  <ARG1
instead  
of  
1  <ARG1
or  
2  
,  
I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
admit*  
,  
nothing  >>ARG1
was*  
broken*  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
can  >ARGM-MOD
recomend*  
them  <ARG1
but  
prepare*  
pay*  
twice  
as  
much  <ARG1
as  
they  >ARG0
tell*  
you  <ARG2
initially  <ARGM-TMP
.  

One  
more  
thing  
,  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
take*  
any  
credit  
cards  <ARG1
or  
checks  
.  

You  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
pay*  
CASH  <ARG1
ONLY  
before  
they  >>ARG0
start*  
unloading*  
track  <ARG1
on  
your  
destination  <ARGM-GOL
.  

Worst  
Apartments  
EVER  

We  >ARG0
lived*  
here  <ARGM-LOC
for  
2  
years  <ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
first  
year  >ARG1
or  
so  
was*  
okay  <ARG2
.  

Then  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  >ARG1
more  
power  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
gave*  >ARGM-ADV
to  
Linda  <ARG2
,  
the  
worse  >ARG2
the  
place  >ARG1
got*  
.  

We  >>ARG0
were*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
having*  
our  
water  >ARG1
shut*  
off  
,  
there  
were*  
always  <ARGM-TMP
people  <ARG1
having*  >ARGM-LVB
parties*  
at  
the  
pool  <ARGM-LOC
,  
even  
after  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
supposed*  
to  
be*  
closed*  
.  

The  
pool  >>ARG1
was*  
supposed*  
to  
close*  
at  
10  <ARGM-TMP
and  
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
people  <ARG1
down  
there  <ARG1
until  
11:45  <ARGM-TMP
yelling*  
,  
playing*  
music  <ARG1
and  
do*  
who  >ARG0
-  
knows*  
-  
what  <ARG1
in  
the  
dark  
corners  <<ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
pool  
.  

Then  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG1
moved*  >ARGM-TMP
out  <ARGM-DIR
,  
we  >ARG0
cleaned*  
the  
apartment  <ARG1
top  <ARGM-MNR
to  
bottom  
,  
they  >>ARG0
came*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
and  
tried*  
to  
charge*  
us  <ARG2
for  
two  
cleaning  
fees  <ARG3
(  
and  
we  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
got*  
our  >ARG0
deposit*  
back  <<C-V
)  
and  
past  
utilities  >>ARG3
(  
that  >>R-ARG3
were*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
paid*  
,  
we  >ARG0
have*  
check  
numbers  <ARG1
and  
records  
of  
this  
)  
.  

Linda  >ARG1
is*  
the  
rudest  
person  >ARG2
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
ever  >ARGM-TMP
talk*  
to  <C-ARG2
and  
she  >ARG0
sticks*  
up  
for  
all  <ARG1
of  
the  
trashy  
,  
rude  
people  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
live*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
,  
not  
the  
nice  
ones  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
give*  
a  
crap  <ARG1
about  
respecting*  
others  <ARG1
.  

Do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
live*  
here  <ARGM-LOC
,  
you  >ARG0

regret*  
it  <ARG1
!  

The  
Worst  >ARGM-ADJ
Experience*  
Ever  <ARGM-TMP
!!!  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
worked*  
with  
Ted  <ARG3
Jurek  
at  
Decor  <ARGM-LOC
and  
You  
,  
and  
it  >ARG1
started*  
out  
as  
a  
decent  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
.  

He  >>ARG1
was*  
referred*  
to  
me  <ARG2
by  
a  
friend  >>ARG0
,  
who  >>R-ARG0
did*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
have*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
with  
Ted  <ARG1
,  
but  
said*  
that  
Ted  >>ARG0
was*  
able*  
to  
make*  
up  
for  
his  >ARG0
lack*  
of  
preparedness  <ARG1
at  
the  
end*  
.  

I  >ARG0
figure*  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
give*  
this  
company  <ARG2
a  
chance*  
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
after  
giving*  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
required  >ARGM-PRD
$  >ARG1
500.00  
(  
NON  
REFUNDABLE  >ARGM-ADJ
)  
deposit*  
before  
seeing*  
any  
plans*  
or  
ideas  
,  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
sorry*  
I  
did*  
.  

We  >ARG0
met*  
a  
couple  
of  
weeks  
later  <ARGM-TMP
,  
Ted  >>ARG1
was*  
late*  
.  

He  >ARG0
brought*  
fabric  
books  >ARG1
,  
and  
pictures  
of  
furniture  
only  
,  
which  >R-ARG1
all  
came*  
way  
over  
budget  <ARG3
.  

By  
the  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG1
got*  
to  
the  
budget  >>ARG1
i  >ARG0
told*  
him  <ARG2
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
work*  
with  <C-ARG1
,  
there  
was*  
basically  <ARGM-ADV
no  >ARGM-NEG
design*  
.  

Just  
curtains  
and  
a  
couple  
of  
accessories  
.  

WHAT  >ARG2
IS*  
THAT  <ARG1
?????  

This  
company  >>ARG1
is*  
way  >ARGM-ADV
too  >ARGM-EXT
expensive*  
with  
nothing  >ARG1
to  
show*  
for  
it  <ARGM-PRP
.  

Please  >>ARGM-DIS
everyone  >>ARGM-DIS
....  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
heed*  
and  
do*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
get*  
caught*  
up  
in  
the  
hype  <ARG2
about  
DECOR  >ARG0
and  
YOU  
working*  
with  
every  
budget  <ARG1
...  

This  >ARG1
is*  
just  >ARGM-ADJ
a  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
for  
them  >ARG0
to  
squirm*  
their  >ARG0
way*  
into  
your  
precious  
pocket  <<ARGM-GOL

Horrible  
.  

Horrible  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
walked*  >ARGM-TMP
in  <ARG2
,  
the  
person  >ARG0
behind  
desk  
said*  
:  
"  
oh  >ARGM-DIS
well  
,  
you  >ARG1
must  >ARGM-MOD
wait*  
,  
I  >ARG1
am*  
in  
the  
middle  <ARG2
of  
something  
.  
"  

After  
a  
good  
few  
minutes  >ARGM-TMP
,  
he  >ARG0
asked*  
:  
"  
what  >>ARG1
do*  
you  >ARG0
want*  
?  
"  

Somewhere  >ARGM-LOC
in  
between  
his  
rudeness  
he  >ARG0
asked*  
if  
we  >ARG0
smoked*  
.  

I  >ARG0
asked*  
if  
this  
hotel  >ARG0
had*  
smoking  
rooms  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
immediately  >ARGM-TMP
said*  
"  
no  >ARGM-DIS
,  
there  
is*  
a  
$  >ARG1
50  
deposit*  
now  <<ARGM-TMP
!  
"  

Sure  
enough  >ARGM-DIS
he  >ARG0
charged*  
it  <ARG1
to  
the  
credit  
card  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
inquired*  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
rudely  >ARGM-MNR
replied*  
"  
in  
the  
morning  >>ARGM-TMP
when  >>ARGM-TMP
things  >>ARG1
are*  
checked*  >ARGM-TMP
out  
you  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
it  <ARG1
back  <C-V
.  
"  

I  >ARG0
called*  
customer  >ARG2
service*  
about  
it  <<ARGM-PRP
because  
the  
website  >ARG0
specifically  >ARGM-MNR
states*  
that  
there  
are*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
other  >ARGM-ADJ
charges*  
at  
the  
check  
-  
in  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
mentioned*  
to  
the  
reception  
person  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
responded*  
"  
we  >ARG0
have*  
problem  <ARG1
with  
'  
people  
'  
"  
.  

Imagine*  
a  
hotel  >ARG0
having*  
problems  <ARG1
with  
people  
.  

I  >ARG0
finally  >ARGM-TMP
alerted*  
him  <ARG1
to  
his  
rudeness  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
said*  
he  >>ARG0
's*  
had*  
a  
long  
and  
bad  
day  <ARG1
.  

We  >>ARG0
had*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
choice*  
but  
to  
stay*  
but  
will  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
this  <ARG1
as  
far  <ARGM-ADV
as  
we  
can  
.  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
stay*  
there  <ARG3
.  

I  >>ARG0
came*  
to  
find*  
out  
the  
person  >ARG1
was*  
the  
hotel  
OWNER  <ARG2
also  <ARGM-DIS
.  

My  
friend  >>ARG1
and  
I  
were*  
to  
stay*  
here  <ARG3
for  
a  
girls  
night  <ARGM-CAU
,  
catch*  
up  
on  
our  
lives  <ARG2
evening  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG1
live*  
within  
20  
miles  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
hotel  
and  
wanted*  
to  
get*  
away  <ARGM-DIR
from  
our  
responsibilities  
for  
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Unfortunalty  
my  
husband  >>ARG0
and  
I  
had*  
to  
put*  
our  
13  
year  
old  
lab  <ARG1
down  <C-V
that  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
and  
we  >>ARG0
were*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
expecting*  
this  <ARG1
.  

My  
friend  >>ARG0
called*  
the  
hotel  <ARG1
to  
cancel*  
our  
room  <ARG1
as  
soon  <<ARGM-TMP
as  
I  >ARG0
called*  
her  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
said*  
that  
we  >ARG1
were*  
to  
be*  
charged*  
for  
this  
room  <ARG3
regardless  <ARGM-ADV
because  
we  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
cancel*  
within  
the  
72  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
called*  
them  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
a  
few  
hours  
after  
putting*  
my  
Bodhi  <ARG1
down  <ARG2
and  
they  >ARG1
still  >ARGM-TMP
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
budge*  
.  

Times  >>ARG1
are*  
hard*  
,  
I  >ARG0
know*  
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
had*  
no  >ARGM-NEG
compassion*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
called*  
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
to  
talked*  
to  
a  
manager  <ARG2
,  
never  
a  
call*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >ARG0
emailed*  
4  
times  <ARGM-TMP
,  
never  
a  
response*  
.  

In  
one  >>ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
emails*  
I  >ARG0
attached*  
the  
letter  >ARG0
from  
the  
Vet  
's  
that  >R-ARG0
expressed*  
their  
sympathy  <ARG1
,  
this  
hotel  >ARG0
did*  
nothing  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
emailed*  
Mackinaw  
Tourist  <ARG2
and  
nothing  
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
sure*  
this  >ARG1
is*  
a  
good  
place  >ARG3
to  
stay*  
from  
reading*  
the  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
reviews*  
,  
but  
if  
something  >ARG1
unexpected  
happens*  >ARGM-ADV
in  
your  
life  <ARGM-LOC
,  
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
care*  
.  

FANFUCKINGTASTIC  

Ok  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG1
am*  
a  
New  
Yorker  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
has*  
been*  
going*  
to  
school  <ARG4
in  
Oxford  <ARGM-LOC
,  
England  
.  

I  >ARG0
thought*  
the  
UK  >>ARG1
was*  
completely  >ARGM-EXT
devoid*  
of  
good  
NYC  
style  
pizza  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
thought*  
to  
get*  >>ARGM-PRP
a  
decent  
pizza  <ARG1
the  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
way*  >ARG1
was*  
at  
a  
fancy  
restaurant  <ARG2
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
get*  
a  
whole  
pie  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
thought*  
I  >>ARG1
would  
have*  
to  
wait*  
until  
I  >ARG0
went*  
home  <ARG4
to  
NYC  
.  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
then  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
went*  
on  
a  
trip*  
to  
Glasgow  <ARG1
and  
was*  
walking*  
around  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
saw*  
this  
place  <ARG1
and  
it  >ARG0
looked*  
like  
the  
HOLY  
GRAIL  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
knew*  
I  >>ARG0
had*  
found*  
the  
real  >ARGM-ADJ
deal*  
,  
big  
pies  >ARG1
,  
sold*  
by  
the  
slice  <ARGM-MNR
,  
with  
the  
pizzas  >ARG1
sitting*  
under  
the  
glass  <ARG2
in  
the  
front  <ARGM-LOC
.  

They  >ARG0
have*  
crushed  
red  
pepper  
flakes  <ARG1
and  
oregano  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
ordered*  
a  
slice  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
tasted*  
like  
I  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-ADV
flew*  
back  
home  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >>ARG0
du*  
n  >ARGM-NEG
no*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
they  >ARG0
did*  
it  <ARG1
,  
but  
Scottish  
friends  >ARGM-DIS
---  
this  >ARG1
is*  
THE  
REAL  >ARGM-ADJ
DEAL*  
.  

I  >ARG0
congratulated*  
this  
establishment  <ARG1
for  
doing*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
research*  
on  
making*  
NYC  
pizza  <ARG1
because  
these  
Scots  >ARG0
fcking  >ARGM-DIS
nailed*  
it  <ARG1
.  

That  >>ARG1
being*  
said*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
how  >>ARG2
their  >ARG0
delivery  >ARG1
service*  >ARG1
is*  
.  

They  >>ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
want*  
to  
change*  
the  
name  <ARG1
to  
reflect*  
the  
new  
yorkedness  <ARG2
of  
the  
pizza  
,  
scrummy  
yummy  >ARG1
sounds*  
gimmicky  <ARG2
to  
me  <ARG3
.  

Good  
food  
,  
good  
wait  
staff  
,  
poor  >ARGM-ADJ
management*  

We  >ARG0
visited*  
on  
7/26/08  <ARGM-TMP
for  
dinner  <ARGM-PRP
We  >ARG0
received*  
a  
gift  
certificate  <ARG1
for  
the  
Mama  
Mia  
's  
on  
Greenfield  
Ave  
.  

The  
food  >>ARG1
was*  
good*  
,  
and  
so  >ARG2
was*  
our  
waitress  <ARG1
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
came*  >>ARGM-TMP
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
pay*  
the  
bill  <ARG2
up  
front  <ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
let*  
me  >ARG0
use*  
any  <ARG1
of  
the  
certificate  
for  
a  
tip*  
(  
which  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
done*  
with  
any  
other  
restaurant  <ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
've*  
gotten*  
a  
gift  
certificate  <ARG1
for  
.  
)  

I  >ARG0
then  >ARGM-TMP
asked*  
if  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
money  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
in  
cash  <ARGM-MNR
.  

The  
person  >>ARG0
went*  
to  
go*  
check*  
with  
the  
manager  >>ARG0
,  
who  >>R-ARG0
was*  
sitting*  
at  
a  
table  <ARG2
chatting*  
with  
her  
friends  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
were*  
eating*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Her  >ARG0
answer*  >>ARG1
was*  
short*  
and  
manner  >ARG1
rather  >ARGM-EXT
rude*  
.  

Sorry  
for  
interrupting*  
I  >ARG0
guess*  
.  

The  
cashier  >>ARG0
was*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
short*  
,  
unapologetic  
and  
made*  
me  >ARG0
feel*  
as  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
wasting*  
her  
time  <ARG1
.  

There  
were*  
no  
other  
options  <ARG1
available  
(  
I  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
brought*  
my  
check  
card  <ARG1
to  
cover*  
any  
overage  
cost  <ARG1
)  
and  
she  >>ARG0
rang*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
and  
applied*  
it  <ARG1
to  
the  
gift  
card  <ARG2
before  
telling*  
me  <ARG2
about  
the  
tip  
policy  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
visiting*  
Mama  
Mia  <ARG1
's  
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

There  
are*  
other  
places  <ARG1
with  
food  
just  
as  
good  
with  
management*  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
values*  
customers  <ARG1
and  
employees  
much  
more  <ARGM-EXT
.

I  >>ARG0

THEY  >>ARG0

WHEN  >ARGM-TMP
YOU  >ARG1

THERE  
IS*  
JUST  <ARGM-ADV
A  
BUNCH  >ARG1
OF

I  >ARG1
WAS*  
THERE  <ARG2
ON  
MARCH  <ARGM-TMP

I  >ARG1
WAS*

THERE  <ARG2
OF

OUT  <ARGM-DIR
WITH  
A

ON

THE  
MANAGER  >>ARG0
CAME*  
OVER  <ARGM-DIR

SAID*  
HE  >>ARG1
WAS*  
SORRY*  
AND  
GAVE*  
A

HE  >ARG0
SAID*  
WE  >ARG0

BECAUSE  
THE

IN  
MY

JUST  >ARGM-ADV
TOOK*  
OFF  
THE  
PRICE*  
OF  
THE  
WINGS  <ARG1
FROM  
THE  
BILL  <<ARGM-DIR
.  

BUT  >ARGM-DIS
EVERYONE  >ARG0
HAS*  
THERE  >ARG0
OWN  >ARGM-REC
WAY*  
!!!!!!  

Mezza  
Luna  
FTW  
!  

their  
mezza  
luna's  >>ARG1
are*  
deffly  >ARGM-ADV
better*  
than  
the  
pizza  >ARG1
rolls*  
.  

it  >ARG1
s*  
like  
a  
pizza  >ARG1
roll*  
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
toss*  
ham  <ARG1
and  
cheese  
inside  <ARGM-DIR
.  

it  
seems*  
like  
it  >>ARG1
s*  
healthier*  
too  <<ARGM-DIS
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
s*  
prolly  <ARGM-ADV
not  <ARGM-NEG
.  

also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
call*  
em  <ARG1
ahead  <ARGM-TMP
of  
time  
,  
and  
then  
go*  
to  
pick*  
up  
ur  
food  <ARG1
,  
or  
have*  
it  >ARG1
delivered*  
**  
.  

that  >ARG0
cuts*  
down  
on  
teh  
wait  
time  <ARG1
,  
cus  
u  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
other  
stuff  <ARG1
while  
u  >>ARG1
r*  
waiting*  
.  

it  >ARG0
usually  >ARGM-ADV
takes*  
20  
mins  <ARG1
for  
a  
mezza  
luna  <C-ARG0
,  
as  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
add*  
pure  
delicious  
extract  <ARG1
to  
the  
mix  <ARG2
.  

their  
pizza  >ARG1
was*  
a  
little  
salty  <ARG2
for  
me  <ARGM-GOL
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
s*  
still  >ARGM-TMP
good*  
.  

they  >ARG0
do*  
that  
whole  
thing  >ARGM-ADV
where  >R-ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
sandwich*  
the  
pepperoni  <ARG1
between  
layers  <ARG2
of  
cheese  
for  
+  
32  <ARGM-PRP
delicious  
.  

anyways  
,  
the  
mezza  
luna  
:  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
try*  
it  <ARG1
.  

it  >ARG1
runs*  
you  <ARG3
about  
4  
bucks  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG0
deals*  
crushing  
blows*  
to  
hunger  <<ARG1
.

Edit  
:  
Living*  >>ARGM-ADV
on  
campus  <ARGM-LOC
at  
Clarkson  
University  <ARGM-LOC
,  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
had*  
food  >ARG1
delivered*  
before  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

This  >ARG1
was*  
back  <ARGM-ADV
between  
'05  <ARG2
and  
'09  
and  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
remember*  
how  
many  
times  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG0
've*  
had*  
it  >ARG1
delivered*  
.  

Perhaps  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
deliver*  
anymore  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
the  
deliciousness  >ARG0
of  
a  
mezza  
luna  
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
warrants*  
a  
pickup  <ARG1
.  

My  
2004  
x  
-  
type  >>ARG1
was*  
getting*  
close*  
to  
100,000  
miles  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
was*  
time  <ARG2
for  
an  
upgrade*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
sent*  
my  
wife  <ARG1
and  
daughter  
over  <ARGM-DIR
to  
check*  
out  
a  
pre-owned  
2009  
XF  <ARG1
.  

Michael  >>ARG1
Chestney  
was*  
very  >>ARGM-EXT
pleasant*  
and  
patient*  
with  
my  
wife  <ARG2
and  
she  >ARG0
suggested*  
I  >>ARG0
go*  
check*  
it  <ARG1
out  <C-V
.  

I  >>ARG0
went*  
in  <ARG4
later  <ARGM-TMP
that  
afternoon  <ARGM-TMP
and  
met*  
with  
Michael  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
showed*  
me  <ARG2
the  
car  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG1
was*  
interested*  
in  <C-ARG2
and  
we  >>ARG0
took*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
test  >ARGM-PRP
drive*  
.  

I  >ARG0
loved*  
the  
car  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0
began*  
negotiating*  
my  >ARG0
trade*  
-  
in  <C-V
and  
the  
price*  
of  
the  
09  
XF  <ARG1
.  

The  
entire  >ARGM-ADJ
negotiation*  >ARG0
took*  
about  
20  
minutes  <ARG1
.  

Fair  
give  
and  
take  
on  
both  
sides*  
until  
we  >ARG0
agreed*  
on  
a  
deal*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
was*  
within  
my  
parameters  <ARG2
and  
was*  
fair*  
to  
both  
sides*  
.  

10  
minutes  
of  
paperwork  
and  
I  >ARG1
was*  
the  
owner  <ARG2
of  
a  
beautiful  
pre-owned  
09  
XF  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
purchased*  
over  
15  
vehicles  <ARG1
(  
cars  
,  
rvs  
,  
and  
boats  
)  
in  
my  
lifetime  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
say*  
the  
experience*  >ARG1
with  
Michael  <ARG1
and  
Barrett  
Motor  
Cars  
of  
San  
Antonio  
was*  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
best  
.  

Friendly  
,  
knowledgeable  
,  
and  
above  
all  
fair  
.  

That  >ARG1
's*  
all  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
really  >ARGM-ADV
ask*  
from  
a  
car  
dealer  <ARG2
and  
Michael  >ARG0
and  
Barrett  
hit*  
all  
3  <ARG1
.  

Thanks*  
for  
the  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
deal*  
and  
the  
great  
car  
!  

Identity  
Theft  

Myself  
and  
my  
fiance  
's  
identity  >>ARG1
was*  
stolen*  
from  
the  
office  
staff  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG0
were*  
told*  
by  
a  
detective  <ARG0
and  
asked*  
to  
check*  
our  >ARG1
credit*  
for  
anything  <<ARG2
unusual  
.  

Luckily  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG0
caught*  
the  
crooks  <ARG1
before  
they  >ARG0
did*  
one  <ARG1
on  
us  
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
a  
black  
female  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
use*  
to  
work*  
in  
the  
office  <ARGM-LOC
.  

She  >>ARG0
stole*  
the  
information  <ARG1
and  
gave*  
it  <ARG1
to  
another  
guy  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
did*  >ARGM-LVB
all  
the  
work*  
.  

The  
other  
guy  >>ARG1
was*  
pulled*  
over  
one  
day  <ARGM-TMP
and  
a  
cop  >ARG0
saw*  
suspicious  
papers  <ARG1
with  
names  
and  
social  
security  
numbers  
on  
it  
.  

That  >ARG1
s*  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
they  >>ARG1
were*  
caught*  
.  

They  >ARG0
both  
went*  
to  
jail  <ARG4
and  
a  
new  
manager  >>ARG1
was*  
put*  
in  
charge*  
of  
the  
apartments  <ARG2
.  

The  
apartment  >ARG0
across  
from  
mine  
belonged*  
to  
a  
gang  <ARG1
of  
hookers  
.  

Nobody  >ARG0
lived*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

A  
girl  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
show*  
up  
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
a  
guy  >ARG1
in  
a  
nice  
car  
would  >ARGM-MOD
show*  
up  
.  

Short  
time  
later  >ARGM-TMP
the  
guy  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
leave*  
,  
then  
the  
girl  
.  

My  
apartment  >>ARG1
was*  
usually  >ARGM-TMP
quiet*  
.  

I  >ARG0
lived*  
in  
one  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
face*  
the  
parking  
lot  <ARG1
.  

Parking  
spaces  >>ARG1
are*  
just  >>ARGM-EXT
big*  >ARG2
enough*  
for  
a  
Mini  
Cooper  <ARG3
.  

It  
sucked*  
having*  
an  
SUV  <ARG1
.  

If  
I  >ARG0
found*  >ARGM-ADV
a  
spot  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
fit*  
in  
it  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Gates  >ARG0
worked*  
30  
%  <ARGM-EXT
of  
the  
time  
at  
best  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Bugs  >ARG1
were*  
a  
small  
problem  <ARG2
,  
nothing  
too  
bad  
.  

The  
best  >ARG1
there  
is*  
in  
service*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
recently  >ARGM-TMP
traveling*  
down  
I  
-  
24  <ARG1
from  
Nashville  <ARG2
with  
my  
3  
young  
children  <ARGM-COM
and  
had*  
a  
blowout  <ARG1
on  
the  
southeast  
side  <ARGM-LOC
of  
Murfreesboro  
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
4:50  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
a  
friend  >ARG0
told*  
me  >ARG0
to  
call*  
Bud  <ARG1
,  
he  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
me  <ARG1
.  

Not  
only  
did  
they  >ARG0
answer*  
the  
phone  <ARG1
at  
4:50  <ARGM-TMP
on  
a  
Thursday  <ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >>ARG1
hit*  
the  
ground  <ARG1
moving*  
!.  

They  >>ARG0
tracked*  
down  
the  
only  
tire  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
fit*  
my  
BMW  
330i  <ARG2
in  
Murfreesboro  
within  
minutes  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
secured*  
it  <ARG1
,  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
came*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
,  
took*  
off  
my  
tire  <ARG1
(  
it  >ARG1
was*  
a  
runflat  <ARG2
-  
but  
runflats  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
you  <ARG2
any  
good  <ARG1
if  
they  >ARG1
blow*  
out  
)  
,  
and  
brought*  
it  <ARG1
to  
their  
shop  <ARG2
to  
change*  
the  
tire  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
were*  
back  <ARG2
quickly  <ARGM-ADV
considering*  
how  
far  >ARG2
outside  
of  
Murfreesboro  
we  >ARG1
were*  
and  
had*  
us  <ARG1
on  
our  >ARG0
way*  
by  
6:30  <<ARGM-TMP
that  
evening  
.  

Thanks*  
Bud  <ARGM-DIS
for  
all  <ARG2
of  
your  >ARG0
help*  
and  
taking*  
time  <ARG1
away  <C-V
from  
your  
family  <ARGM-LOC
that  
evening  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
without  
a  
doubt*  
,  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
service  >ARG1
experience*  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
've*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had*  
and  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
be*  
clear*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
price*  >>ARG1
he  >ARG0
charged*  
me  <ARG2
was*  
the  
same  <ARG2
as  
my  
tire  
guy  >ARG0
in  
Nashville  
's  
price*  
for  
putting*  
on  <ARG2
the  
other  
rear  
tire  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
hope*  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
return*  
the  
favor  <ARG1
in  
the  
future  <ARGM-TMP
!

Grissom  

Room  
ok  
.  

Service*  
and  
Client  
base  
not  
ok  
.  

I  >>ARG1
have*  
stayed*  
in  
this  
hotel  <ARG3
many  
times  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
while  
it  >ARG0
typically  >ARGM-ADV
offers*  >ARGM-ADV
a  
decent  
bang  <ARG1
for  
the  
buck  
,  
its  
client  
base  >ARG1
largely  >ARGM-EXT
consists*  
of  
troubled  
youngsteers  <ARG2
and  
evictees  
from  
the  
local  
,  
not  
so  
pleasant  
hood  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
considered*  
this  <ARG1
a  
real  
problem  <ARG1
as  
I  >>ARG0
travel*  
without  
kids  <ARGM-COM
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
fend*  
for  
myself  <ARG1
,  
but  
when  
I  >>ARG0
had*  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
listen*  
to  
a  
(  
non-violent  >ARGM-ADJ
)  
domestic  >ARGM-ADJ
fight*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
lasted*  
from  
1  
AM  <ARG2
to  
5  
AM  <ARG2
during  
my  >ARG1
last  >ARGM-TMP
stay*  
and  
I  >ARG0
found*  
out  
that  
the  
front  
desk  >ARG1
was*  
unmanned  <ARG2
during  
night  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
,  
my  >ARG0
choice*  >ARG1
was*  
to  
either  
waste*  
tax  
payers  
money  <ARG1
by  
calling*  
for  
a  
yet  
another  
police  
dispatch  <ARG1
to  
this  
hotel  
,  
or  
just  >ARGM-ADV
get*  
over  
it  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG1
chose*  
the  
later  <ARG1
,  
but  
approached*  
the  
front  
desk  <ARG2
about  
the  
hotel  
policy  <ARGM-PRP
to  
push*  
over  <ARGM-DIR
their  
responsibilities  <ARG1
on  
local  
authorities  <ARG2
,  
not  
to  
mention  
the  
good  
night  
s  
sleep  >>ARG1
i  >>ARG0
paid*  
for  <C-ARG3
but  
did*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
.  

I  >>ARG2
was*  
told*  
management*  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
call*  
me  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-PRD
but  
still  >ARGM-TMP
waiting*  
for  
that  
call*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
stay*  
here  <ARG3
again  <ARGM-TMP
because  
it  >>ARG1
s*  
cheap*  
and  
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
afford*  
a  
better  
hotel  <ARG1
,  
but  
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
look*  
forward  
to  
it  <ARG1
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG
recommend*  
this  
hotel  <ARG1
for  
families  <ARG2
or  
single  
female  
travellers  
.  

Was*  
there  <ARG2
this  
past  
weekend  <ARGM-TMP
and  
the  
guy  >ARG0
behind  
the  
counter  
yelled*  
at  
me  <ARG2
and  
my  
son  
because  
we  >ARG0
believed*  
he  >ARG0
left*  
the  
grandma  
slice  <ARG1
in  
the  
oven  <ARG2
a  
little  
too  
long  <ARGM-TMP
and  
the  
cheese  
got*  
all  
dried  
out  
and  
the  
slice  >ARG1
tasted*  
more  
like  
a  
cracker  <ARG2
.  

He  >>ARG0
preceded*  
to  
grab*  
the  
slice  <ARG1
off  
the  
countertop  <ARGM-LOC
and  
throw*  
it  <ARG1
into  
the  
trash  <ARG2
while  
yelling*  
at  
me  <ARG2
saying*  
,  
"  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
order*  
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
about  <C-ARG1
"  
and  
"  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
pizza  >>ARG1
is*  
made*  
"  
.  

It  
was*  
very  
upsetting  <ARG2
to  
see*  
this  
kind  <ARG1
of  
behavior  
especially  
in  
front  <ARGM-LOC
of  
my  
four  
year  
old  
.  

He  >ARG1
was*  
in  
the  
process*  
of  
making*  
me  <ARG3
a  
pie  <ARG1
and  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
got*  >>ARGM-TMP
home  <ARG2
,  
the  
pie  >>ARG1
was*  
the  
worst*  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
seen*  
.  

Cheese  >>ARG1
was*  
falling*  
off  <ARGM-DIR
,  
so  
oily  
and  
greasy  
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
he  >ARG0
did*  
it  <ARG1
on  
purpose  <ARGM-MNR
because  
of  
my  >ARG0
simple  >ARGM-ADJ
request*  
for  
another  
slice  >>ARG1
of  
grandma  
that  >>R-ARG1
was*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
so  >ARGM-EXT
well  >ARGM-MNR
-  
done*  
(  
actually  
,  
burnt  
)  
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD

for  
such  >ARGM-EXT

sabotaging*  
my

THIS

,  
Ok  
Food  

The  
first  
thing  >>ARG1
you  >ARG0
notice*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
arrive*  
on  
location  <ARG4
is*  
that  
the  
waiting  
line  >>ARG1
literally  >>ARGM-ADV
goes*  
out  
the  
door  <ARG2
and  
spills*  
into  
the  
parking  
lot  <ARG2
.  

A  
restaurant  >>ARG1
with  
this  
many  
patrons  >ARG1
willing  
to  
stand*  
in  
line  <ARG2
just  >ARGM-ADV
to  
order*  
tacos  <ARG1
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
good*  
,  
right  <ARGM-DIS
?  

I  >ARG0
mean*  
,  
that  >ARG1
's*  
the  
way*  >ARGM-MNR
it  >ARG1
works*  
at  
amusement  
parks  <ARGM-LOC
:  
the  
longest  
lines  >ARG1
are*  
at  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
rides*  
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
this  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
an  
exception*  
.  

The  
staff  >>ARG0
taking*  
your  >ARG0
order*  
and  
"  
waiting*  
"  
on  
you  <ARG1
are*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
indifferent*  
and  
have*  
no  
sense*  
of  
costumer  >ARG2
service*  
at  
all  <<ARGM-EXT
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
gotten*  
better  
results  <ARG1
talking*  
to  
COMCAST  >ARG0
customer  >ARG2
service*  
than  
with  
these  
folks  <<C-ARG1
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
think*  
about  
asking*  
to  
speak*  
to  
the  
manager  <ARG2
because  
this  
guy  >ARG1
is*  
,  
and  
pardon*  
my  
French  <ARG1
,  
a  
jerk  <<ARG2
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
have*  
gotten*  >>ARGM-ADV
through*  
ordering*  
,  
dealing*  
with  
the  
rude  
staff  <ARG1
and  
if  
you  >ARG0
followed*  
the  
dumb  >ARGM-ADJ
rules*  
,  
you  >>ARG2
are*  
finally  >ARGM-TMP
presented*  
with  
what  >ARGM-PRP
you  >ARG1
came*  
for  <C-ARGM-PRP
..  
some  
tacos  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are*  
"  
ok  <ARG2
,  
"  
but  
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG
worth*  
putting*  
up  
with  
all  
the  
hassle*  
.  

Save*  
yourself  <ARG2
the  
trouble  <ARG1
and  
skip*  
this  
place  <ARG1
all  
together  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
suggest*  
you  >ARG0
go*  
up  <ARGM-DIR
to  
Raging

Raging

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
tell*  
you  <ARG2
we  >>ARG1
were*  
pleasantly  >ARGM-MNR
surprised*  
--  
BT  >ARG0
has*  
taste  
memory  <ARG1
and  
each  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
back  
the  
food  >>ARG1

consistently  >ARGM-ADV
delicious*  
--  
same  
dishes  >>ARG1

were*  
consistent*

Our  
friend  >>ARG0

a  
world  
traveler  <ARG2
and  
loves*  
unpretentious  >ARGM-ADJ

inspired  
food

This  
chef  >ARG0
knows*  
what  >>ARG1

doing*

Treat*  
yourself  <ARG2
and  
go*  
--  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
back  <ARG4

I  >>ARG0
am*  
a  
business  
owner  <ARG2
in  
downtown  
Saratoga  
Springs  
and  
wish*  
this  
restaurant  >ARG1
was*  
in  
our  
town  <ARG2
!  

The  
affordable  
rent  >ARG0
makes*  
it  <ARG1
possible*  
for  
an  
inspired  
chef  >ARG0
to  
serve*  
his  
high  
quality  
fare  <ARG1
at  
affordable  >ARGM-ADJ
prices*  
!  

Unlike  
Saratoga  
.  

I  >>ARG0
rrly  >ARGM-TMP
seek*  
the  
cehf  <ARG1
out  <C-V
to  
introduce*  
myself  <ARG1
--  
but  
the  
second  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
went*  
--  
i  >>ARG0
made*  
a  
point  <ARG1
of  
asking*  
our  
wait  
person  >ARG0
to  
introduce*  
my  
friend  >ARG0
and  
myself  
to  
the  
chef  <ARG2
to  
tell*  
him  <ARG2
just  
how  
good  >ARG2
our  
meals  >ARG1
were*  
.  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
wait*  
to  
go*  
gain  <ARGM-TMP
.  

-  
R.  
Morris  
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
that  
the  >>ARG1
re*  
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
good*  
.  

First  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
all  
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
call*  >>ARGM-ADV
for  
an  
appointment*  
they  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tell*  
you  >ARG0
to  
call*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
a  
month  
later  <ARGM-TMP
so  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
then  >ARGM-TMP
make*  
one  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-DIS
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tell*  
you  <ARG2
that  
they  >>ARG1
're*  
going*  
to  
mail*  
you  <ARG2
an  
"  
application*  
"  
to  
be*  
admitted*  
to  
be*  
a  
patient  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
feel*  
that  
the  
way*  >>ARG1
some  
doctor  
s  
offices  >ARG1
work*  
around  
here  <ARGM-LOC
is*  
a  
little  
bit  >ARGM-EXT
absurd*  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
happy*  
that  
these  
guys  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
those  
two  
things  <ARG1
in  
particlular  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Usually  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
seen*  
the  
same  
week  <ARGM-TMP
or  
maybe  
the  
following  
week  
.  

The  
doctor  >>ARG0
did*  
tell*  
me  <ARG2
that  
my  
male  
pattern  
baldness  >ARG1
is*  
due  
to  
my  
mother  
s  
father  <ARG2
because  
the  
gene  >>ARG1
is*  
exclusively  >ARGM-ADV
passed*  
on  
through  
maternal  
line  <ARGM-MNR
but  
that  >ARG1
's*  
a  
common  >ARGM-ADJ
misconception*  
(  
http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm  
)  
.  

In  
general  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
say*  
that  
the  
staff  >>ARG1
is*  
attentive*  
and  
nice*  
.  

But  
then  
again  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG1
was*  
nice*  
to  
them  <ARG2
so  >>ARGM-ADV
that  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
been*  
why  <ARG2
.  

Anyhow  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
after  
reading*  >>ARGM-TMP
some  <ARG1
of  
the  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
reviews*  
it  
seems*  
like  
some  >>ARG0
of  
the  
other  
reviewers  
are*  
expecting*  
mircles  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
want*  
miracles  <ARG1
you  >>ARG0
'll  
have*  
to  
go*  
to  
21st  
St  <ARG4
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
a  
pretty  
typical  
primary  
care  
office  <ARG2
but  
for  
the  
area  >>ARGM-PRP
it  >>ARG1
's*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
good*  
.  

They  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
certain  
things  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
are*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
annoying*  
about  
other  
offices  <ARGM-ADV
.  

First  >ARGM-TMP
trip*  
to  
Canada  <ARG1

I  >>ARG0
recently  >>ARGM-TMP
traveled*  
to  
Canada  <ARG1
on  
business  <ARGM-MNR
and  
had*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
most  
excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
.  

I  >ARG0
work*  
for  
a  
large  
retail  
company  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
expanding*  
our  >ARG0
operations*  
into  
Canada  <<ARG4
and  
had*  
to  
travel*  
to  
ensure*  
all  >>ARG1
of  
our  
computer  
network  
equipment  
was*  
installed*  
properly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
on  
time  
.  

This  >>ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
tend*  
to  
be*  
a  
stressful  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
in  
itself  <<ARGM-ADV
let  
alone  
adding*  
crossing  
boarders  <ARG1
for  
the  
first  
time  
.  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
pleased*  
to  
find*  
my  >ARG1
accommodations*  >ARG1
and  
the  
hotel  
staff  
to  
be*  
a  
very  
calming  
and  
comforting  
part  <ARG2
of  
my  >ARG0
trip*  
.  

I  >ARG0
found*  
the  
hotel  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
amazingly  >ARGM-ADV
clean*  
,  
not  
to  
mention  
very  >ARGM-EXT
well  >ARGM-EXT
adorned*  
with  
many  >ARGM-EXT
pleasant  >ARGM-ADJ
surprises*  
.  

From  
my  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
encounter*  >ARGM-TMP
at  
check  
in  <ARGM-TMP
to  
my  
regrettable  
check  
out  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
found*  
the  
staff  >ARG0
and  
facility  
to  
exceed*  
my  >ARG0
expectation*  
.  

I  >>ARG1
completely  >>ARGM-ADV
enjoyed*  
my  >ARG0
whole  >ARGM-ADJ
check  >ARG1
in  
experience*  
and  
was*  
impressed*  
with  
the  
friendliness  <ARG0
and  
professionalism  
of  
the  
staff  
as  
well  
as  
the  
accommodations*  
themselves  <ARGM-PRD
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
traveling*  
in  
this  
area  <ARG1
in  
the  
future  <ARGM-TMP
and  
you  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
assured*  
that  
this  
experience*  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
helpful*  
in  
my  >ARG0
choice*  
of  
hotels  <ARG1
and  
Novotel  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
my  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
selection*  
.  

Yes  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
parking*  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
challenge*  
but  
being*  
from  
NJ  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG1
am*  
no  
stranger  <ARG2
to  
tight  
corners  
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
pass*  
my  >ARG0
appreciation*  
to  
the  
Staff  <<ARG2
and  
Management*  
for  
their  
excellent  
hospitality  <<ARGM-CAU
and  
good  
spirits  
as  
it  >>ARG0
helped*  
make*  
a  
stressful  >ARGM-ADJ
trip*  >ARG1
enjoyable*  
.  

Favorite  
place  
in  
Tampa  
.  

Update*  
:  
I  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
add*  
to  
my  >ARG0
review*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
just  <ARGM-ADV
in  <ARG2
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
and  
had*  
a  
chance*  >ARGM-ADV
to  
dine*  
in  
their  
new  
dining  
room  <ARGM-LOC
.  

AMAZING  
!  

I  >ARG0
frequent*  
this  
resturant  <ARG1
on  
a  
weekly  
basis  <ARGM-TMP
but  
usally  
only  
for  
lunch  
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG1
was*  
in  
for  
a  
treat  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG1
was*  
greeted*  
by  
the  
friendly  
girls  >ARG0
at  
the  
counter  
who  >R-ARG0
asked*  
if  
my  
wife  >>ARG1
and  
I  
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
sit*  
in  
their  
"  
new  
"  
dining  
room  <ARG2
.  

Right  
away  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
told*  
us  <ARG2
that  
it  >ARG1
was*  
the  
same  
great  
food  <ARG2
with  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
prices*  
so  >ARGM-ADV
off  >ARGM-PRD
we  >ARG0
went*  
.  

We  >>ARG1
were*  
greeted*  
again  <ARGM-TMP
and  
sat*  
promptly  <ARGM-TMP
.  

After  
looking*  >>ARGM-TMP
at  
the  
menu  <ARG1
and  
seeing*  
the  
new  
menu  
items  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
had*  
,  
we  >ARG0
knew*  
we  >ARG1
were*  
in  
for  
a  
treat  <ARG2
!  

I  >ARG0
had*  
the  
Chicken  
Parmesan  
Dinner  <ARG1
and  
my  
wife  >ARG0
had*  
the  
Shrimp  
Scampi  
Dinner  <ARG1
.  

AMAZING  
!  

The  
portions  >>ARG2
were*  
generous*  
enough  <ARGM-CXN
that  
we  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
took*  
some  <ARG1
home  <ARG3
!  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
say*  
the  
value  >ARG0
of  
this  
place  
always  >ARGM-TMP
amazes*  
me  <ARG1
.  

It  
's*  
nice*  
to  
see*  
that  
even  
in  
the  
economy  >>ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
eat*  
a  
place  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
has*  
upscale  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
,  
amazing  
atmosphere  
,  
and  
Incredible  
food  
,  
but  
not  >ARGM-NEG
break*  
the  
bank  <ARG1
while  
enjoying*  
it  <ARG1
!  

Bottom  
line  >ARG1
is*  
that  
when  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
's*  
a  
small  
privatly  
owned  
resturant  >>ARGM-TMP
like  
this  >ARG1
is*  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
tell*  
that  
the  
owners  >>ARG0
and  
employees  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
pride*  
in  
their  >ARG0
product  <ARG1
and  
service*  
.  

Well  
Done  
!  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
work*  
and  
honest  
establishment  
!  

I  >ARG0
typically  >ARGM-ADV
have*  
work*  >ARGM-PRR
done*  
on  
my  
Jeep  <<ARG1
at  
the  
dealership  <<ARGM-LOC
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
is*  
6  
years  >ARG2
old*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
and  
getting*  
charged*  >>ARG0
dealership  >ARG0
prices*  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem*  
cost  >ARGM-MNR
effective*  
anymore  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >>ARG1
had*  
tried*  
out  
few  
place  <ARG1
around  
the  
area  
and  
had*  
been*  
ripped*  
off  
a  
few  
times  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
had*  
hear*  
great  
things  <ARG1
about  
Phet  
and  
G&G  
Automotive  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
decided*  
to  
give*  >ARGM-LVB
him  >ARG1
a  
try*  
.  

The  
service*  >>ARG1
was*  
excellent*  
and  
personable  
.  

He  >>ARG0
checked*  
out  
what  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
needed*  
to  
have*  
done*  
told*  
me  <ARG2
what  >>ARG1
needed*  
be*  
fixed*  
before  
he  >>ARG0
did*  >ARGM-LVB
any  
work*  
and  
did*  >ARGM-LVB
great  >ARGM-ADJ
repair  >ARG1
work*  
.  

The  
price*  >>ARG1
was*  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
lower*  
than  
what  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
had*  
anticipated*  
and  
used  
to  
compared  
to  
other  
places  
,  
plus  
he  >ARG0
showed*  
me  <ARG2
the  
work*  >ARGM-PRR
he  <ARG0
did*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
came*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
to  
pick*  
up  
the  
car  <ARG1
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
a  
week  
after  
the  
work*  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Phet  >ARG0
called*  
me  >>ARG0
up  <C-V
to  
see*  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
my  
car  >>ARG1
was*  
running*  
and  
to  
let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
that  
they  >>ARG0
had*  
accidentally  >ARGM-ADV
overcharged*  
me  <ARG2
for  
part  <ARG3
of  
the  
work*  
and  
wanted*  
to  
give*  >ARGM-LVB
me  
a  
refund*  
for  
that  
amount  <ARG1
.  

That  >>ARG1
is*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
unheard*  
of  <ARGM-ADV
these  
days  <ARGM-TMP
!  

I  >>ARG1
grew*  
up  
in  
a  
small  
town  >>ARGM-LOC
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
you  >>ARG0
knew*  
and  
trusted*  
your  
mechanic  <ARG1
and  
was*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
cynical*  
about  
city  
auto  >ARG1
repair*  
shops  <<ARG0
since  
I  >ARG1
moved*  
here  <ARG2
,  
but  
Phet  >>ARG0
has*  
shown*  
that  
there  
really  >ARGM-ADV
are*  
honest  
hard  
working  
mechanics  <ARG1
around  <ARGM-LOC
.  

He  >ARG1
is*  
my  
mechanic  <ARG2
going*  
forward  <ARGM-DIR
!  

Our  
company  >ARG1
is*  
a  
high  
end  
designer  
handbag  
and  
fashion  
accessories  
company  <ARG2
,  
thus  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG1
are*  
certainly  <ARGM-ADV
a  
niche  
market  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG1
had*  
been*  
evaluating*  
SEO  
providers  <ARG1
for  
quite  
some  
time  <ARGM-TMP
and  
finally  >ARGM-TMP
decided*  
to  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
plunge*  
with  
Stuart  <ARGM-COM
,  
and  
Ulistic  
.  

We  >>ARG0
made*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
decision*  
for  
a  
couple  <ARGM-CAU
of  
reasons  
.  

1  
.  
Social  
Media  
.  

We  >>ARG1
were*  
familiar*  
with  
Search  
Engine  >ARG1
Optimization*  
strategies  <<ARG2
,  
but  
new  
nothing  
about  
Social  
Media  
-  
we  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
heard*  
that  
it  >ARG1
was*  
the  
next  
big  
thing  <ARG2
.  

2  
.  
We  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
liked*  
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
Stuart  >ARG0
sets*  
defined  
objectives  <ARG1
and  
we  >>ARG0
meet*  
once  <ARGM-TMP
a  
month  
to  
go*  
over*  
our  
Key  
Performance  
Indicators  <ARG1
.  

How  >>ARGM-MNR
has*  
it  >ARG1
gone*  
so  
far  <ARGM-TMP
?  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
we  >>ARG0
have*  
been*  
working*  
with  
Ulistic  <ARG3
for  
1.5  
months  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
have*  
100  
people  >ARG0
following*  
our  
site  <ARG1
on  
Facebook  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
our  
web  
site  >>ARG0
,  
www.designofashion.com  
has*  
seen*  
a  
3  
fold  >ARG2
increase*  >>ARG0
in  
traffic  <ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG0
is*  
significantly  >ARGM-EXT
beating*  
our  >ARG0
expectations*  
-  
SEO  >ARG1
is*  
a  
process*  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
takes*  
time  <ARG1
and  
to  
get*  >ARG1
results  <ARG1
this  
quickly  <ARGM-TMP
is*  
exceptional  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG1
are*  
absolutely  >ARGM-EXT
confident*  
that  
Stuart  
's  
ethical  
and  
focused  
strategies  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
see*  
these  
trends  >>ARG1
continue*  
to  
grow*  
,  
and  
our  
business  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
reap*  
the  
rewards  <ARG1
of  
this  
program  
.  

Finally  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
it  
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
said*  
that  
Stuart  >ARG1
is*  
a  
fantastic  
person  >ARG3
to  
work*  
with  <C-ARG3
,  
because  
of  
his  
solid  
strategies  <ARGM-CAU
and  
equally  
as  
importantly  
because  
he  >ARG1
is*  
a  
genuinely  
good  
person  <ARG2
and  
a  
great  
communicator  
.  

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
and  
quality  

I  >ARG0
had*  
Hom  
-  
Excel  >ARG0
replace*  
most  <ARG1
of  
the  
windows  
in  
my  >ARG0
Tampa  >ARG1
residence*  
three  
years  
ago  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
excellent  
windows  >>ARG0
have*  
performed*  
without  
any  
problems  <ARGM-MNR
,  
but  
that  >ARG1
's*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
why  >>ARGM-CAU
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
writing*  
my  >ARG0
review*  
.  

Three  
weeks  
ago  >ARGM-TMP
,  
burglars  >>ARG0
tried*  
to  
gain*  
entry*  
into  
the  
rear  <ARG1
of  
my  
home  
.  

The  
intruders  >ARG0
slit*  
the  
screen  <ARG1
of  
the  
window  
.  

Next  >ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >>ARG0
tried*  
to  
force*  
the  
window  <ARG1
with  
a  
pry  
bar  <ARGM-MNR
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
to  
break*  
the  
window  <ARG1
with  
a  
hammer  <ARG2
.  

The  
window  >>ARG1
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
break*  
!  

My  
next  
-  
door  
neighbor  >>ARG0
heard*  
the  
noise  <ARG1
and  
turned*  
on  
a  
light  <ARG1
,  
thankfully  >ARGM-MNR
scaring*  
the  
two  
miscreants  <ARG1
away  <ARG3
(  
they  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
left*  
their  
hammer  <ARG1
behind  <C-V
!  
)  
.  

I  >>ARG1
called*  
Home  
-  
Excel  <ARG1
the  
next  
day  <ARGM-TMP
to  
order*  
a  
replacement  
screen  <ARG1
for  
the  
window  <ARG2
,  
and  
was*  
happily  >ARGM-MNR
surprised*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
said*  
that  
they  >>ARG0
were*  
n't  
even  
going*  
to  
charge*  
me  <ARG2
for  
the  
replacement  
screen  <ARG3
...  
that  
it  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
covered*  
under  
their  
guarentee  <ARG0
.  

Lo  >>ARGM-DIS
and  
behold  
,  
they  >>ARG0
replaced*  
the  
screen  >>ARG1
(  
which  >>R-ARG1
had*  
to  
be*  
ordered*  
)  
yesterday  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
charge*  
me  <ARG2
a  
dime  <ARG1
.  

Their  
worker  >>ARG0
even  >>ARGM-ADV
cleaned*  
3  <ARG1
of  
my  
windows  
and  
changed*  
a  
lightbulb  <ARG1
for  
me  <ARGM-GOL
.  

In  
this  
day  >>ARGM-TMP
and  
age  
,  
it  
is*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
rare*  
to  
find*  
a  
company  <ARG1
with  
such  
nice  
workers  
and  
such  
far  
ranging  
guarantee  
policies  
.  

I  >ARG0
rarely  >ARGM-TMP
write*  
reviews*  
such  
as  
this  
one  <ARGM-ADJ
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
deserve*  
anyone  
's  
business  <ARG1
!  

Friendly  
staff  
,  
but  
definitely  
some  
problems  

May  
,  
2009  
.  

We  >>ARG2
were*  
booked*  
at  
the  
Sheraton  <ARG1
with  
a  
number  <ARGM-COM
of  
other  
out  
-  
of  
-  
town  
wedding  
guests  
.  

Got*  
put*  
into  
the  
wrong  
room  <ARG2
the  
first  
night  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
were*  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
surprised*  
to  
have*  
someone  >ARG0
with  
the  
same  
room  
key  
trying*  
to  
get*  
in  
the  
door  <ARG2
at  
1:00  
am  <ARGM-TMP
!  

Next  
day  >>ARGM-TMP
got*  
moved*  
into  
another  
room  <ARG2
,  
on  
the  
same  
floor  
with  
other  
wedding  
guests  
.  

There  
were*  
3  
adults  <ARG1
in  
our  
room  
but  
towels  
for  
only  
2  
,  
no  
linens  
for  
sofa  
bed  
.  

In  
the  
second  
room  >ARGM-LOC
it  
took*  
3  
tries  <ARG1
to  
get*  
all  
the  
towels  >ARG1
and  
linens  
we  >ARG0
requested*  
.  

A  
package  >>ARG1
and  
some  
wedding  
cards  
were*  
left*  
in  
our  
first  
room  <ARG2
.  

They  >>ARG1
were*  
sent*  
to  
our  
second  
room  <ARG2
and  
had*  
been*  
opened*  
--  
the  
ribbon  
-  
wrapped  
present  <C-ARG1
,  
and  
all  
3  
envelopes  
.  

Security  >>ARG0
in  
the  
hotel  
seemed*  
to  
be*  
excellent*  
,  
but  
we  >>ARG0
were*  
never  >>ARGM-NEG
given*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
explanation*  
as  
to  
why  >ARGM-CAU
someone  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
open*  
these  
items  <ARG1
.  

A  
mid-afternoon  
"  
fire  
drill  >>ARG0
"  
was*  
disruptive  <ARG2
,  
putting*  
everyone  <ARG1
out  
of  
the  
hotel  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
called*  >ARGM-TMP
the  
front  
desk  <ARG1
about  
an  
extremely  
boisterous  
crowd  <ARGM-CAU
in  
the  
hall  
outside  
our  
door  
quite  
late  
at  
night  
,  
it  >ARG1
seemed*  
to  
take*  
the  
hotel  
staff  <ARG2
quite  
a  
while  <ARG1
to  
quiet*  
them  <ARG1
down  <C-V
.  

The  
staff  >>ARG0
was*  
friendly*  
,  
especially  
the  
front  
desk  
female  
supervisor  >>C-ARG0
,  
and  
seemed*  
to  
want*  
to  
help*  
,  
but  
too  
many  
unusual  
things  >ARG1
happened*  
to  
make*  
us  >>ARG1
want*  
to  
stay*  
there  <ARG3
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Be*  
Careful*  
Of  
Who  >ARG2
Your  
Sales  
Guy  >ARG1
Is*  

I  >>ARG0
think*  
this  
place  >>ARG1
is*  
probably  >ARGM-ADV
really  >ARGM-EXT
great*  
especially  >ARGM-ADV
judging*  
by  
the  
reviews*  
on  
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

My  >ARG0
experience*  >>ARG1
was*  
awful*  
though  <ARGM-DIS
.  

It  >>ARG0
ALL  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
do*  
with  
the  
sales  
guy  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
was*  
a  
young  
22  
year  >>ARG0
old  
who  >>R-ARG0
had*  
admittedly  >>ARGM-ADV
only  >>ARGM-ADV
been*  
working*  
for  
2  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
interested*  
in  
the  
car  <ARG2
and  
very  
likely  >>ARGM-ADV
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
bought*  
it  <ARG1
,  
but  
the  
sales  
guy  >>ARG0
I  >ARG0
dealt*  
with  <C-ARG1
ruined*  
the  
deal*  
.  

Essentially  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
told*  
him  <ARG2
I  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
trust*  
him  <ARG1
cause  
he  >ARG1
was*  
a  
car  
salesman  <ARG2
,  
but  
he  >>ARG1
got*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
incredibly  >ARGM-ADV
offended*  
at  
that  
statement*  
that  
he  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
go*  
cry*  
to  
another  
salesman  <ARG2
and  
compose*  
himself  <ARG1
before  
coming*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
if  
the  
kid  >ARG0
had*  
a  
bad  
day  <ARG1
or  
what  
,  
but  
I  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
sit*  
and  
apologize*  
about  
nothing  <ARG1
for  
10  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
until  
he  >ARG0
dropped*  
the  
issue*  
.  

After  
that  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
tried*  
to  
ignore*  
his  >ARG0
lack*  
of  
professionalism  <ARG1
and  
test  >ARGM-PRP
drive*  
the  
car  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
played*  
dumb*  
and  
asked*  
him  <ARG2
questions*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
already  >ARGM-TMP
knew*  
the  
answers*  
to  <C-ARG1
and  
he  >ARG0
responded*  
with  
half  
truths  <ARG2
and  
a  
few  
falsehoods  
.  

For  
instance  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
asked*  
who  >ARG0
owned*  
Mazda  <ARG1
and  
he  >ARG0
said*  
with  
confidence  <ARGM-MNR
that  >ARG1
was*  
GM  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
true*  
.  

I  >ARG0
mean*  
,  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
care*  
if  
he  >>ARG0
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
,  
but  
if  
he  >>ARG0
pretends*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
know*  
and  
tells*  
me  <ARG2
BS  <ARG1
to  
my  
face  <ARGM-MNR
,  
there  
's*  
no  
way*  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
going*  
to  
trust*  
him  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
matters  >ARG1
turn*  
to  
the  
price*  
of  
the  
car  <ARG1
and  
financing*  
.  

The  
Worst  
Chinese  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
've*  
Ever  >ARGM-TMP
Had*  

This  >ARG1
is*  
by  
far  <ARGM-ADV
the  
worst  
chinese  
food  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had*  
.  

The  
service*  >ARG1
stunk*  
.  

I  >>ARG1
called*  
in  
my  >ARG0
order*  
and  
upon  
arriving*  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
pick*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
,  
they  >ARG0
got*  
my  >ARG0
order*  >ARG2
confused*  
with  
someone  <ARG3
else  
s  
.  

They  >ARG0
helped*  
about  
three  
other  
people  <ARG2
before  
they  >>ARG0
offered*  
to  
help*  
me  <ARG2
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-DIS
got*  
my  
friend  >ARG0
s  
order*  >ARG1
mixed*  
up  
and  
wanted*  
to  
charger*  
her  <ARG2
$  
10  
more  <ARG1
than  
what  >>ARG1
she  >>ARG0
had*  
wanted*  
.  

She  >ARG0
asked*  
for  
the  
dinner  
combo  <ARG1
and  
they  >ARG0
gave*  
her  <ARG2
two  
dinner  
plates  <ARG1
instead  <ARGM-ADV
.  

We  >>ARG0
were*  
standing*  
in  
the  
store  <ARG2
for  
20  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
to  
simply  >ARGM-ADV
pick*  
up  
an  
order*  
.  

Not  
to  
mention  
that  
the  
wait  
staff  >>ARG1
was*  
about  >ARGM-EXT
as  >ARGM-CXN
pleasant*  
as  
dealing*  
with  
an  
angry  
bull  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
were*  
abrasive  <ARG2
and  
rude*  
-  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG1
were*  
the  
ones  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
messed*  
everything  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

We  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
throw*  
out  
about  
80  
percent  <ARG1
of  
our  
meals  
because  
the  
food  >>ARG1
tasted*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
horrible*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
it  
is*  
possible*  
to  
make*  
orange  
chicken  >>ARG1
,  
sesame  
chicken  
and  
kung  
pao  
chicken  
as  
well  
as  
cheese  
puffs  
taste*  
THAT  >ARGM-EXT
bad*  
but  
China  
Delight  >ARG0
accomplished*  
that  <ARG1
.  

The  
only  
thing  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
was*  
edible  <ARG2
was*  
the  
steamed*  
rice  <ARG1
and  
the  
vegetable  
lo  
mein  >>ARG1
was*  
barely  >ARGM-EXT
tolerable*  
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
here  <ARG4
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Lucky  
Panda  >>ARG1
in  
Willis  
is*  
a  
billion  
times  >ARGM-EXT
better*  
in  
service*  
and  
quality  
of  
the  
meal  
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
no  
idea  <ARG1
how  >ARGM-MNR
China  
Delight  >ARG0
won*  
number  
1  
Chinese  
restaurant  <ARG1
in  
Montgomery  
-  
There  >ARG1
needs*  
to  
be*  
a  
recount  <ARG1
on  
that  
vote*  
.  

Terrible  >ARGM-ADJ
Service*  

One  
of  
the  
worst  >ARGM-ADJ
experiences*  >>ARGM-PRR
I  <ARG0
've*  
ever  <<ARGM-TMP
had*  
with  
a  
auto  >ARG1
repair*  
shop  <<ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
took*  
our  
vehicle  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
for  
a  
repair*  
to  
the  
air  >ARG1
conditioning*  
.  

Approx  
4  
months  
later  >ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
compressor  >ARG1
went*  
out  
.  

We  >>ARG0
took*  
it  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-ADV
in  <ARGM-DIR
to  
have*  
it  >ARG1
repaired*  
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
less  
than  
a  
week  
later  >ARGM-TMP
the  
second  
compressor  >ARG1
went*  
out  
.  

We  >ARG0
went*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
for  
a  
third  >ARGM-ADJ
visit*  
and  
they  >ARG0
fixed*  
it  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
this  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
picked*  >>ARGM-TMP
up  
the  
car  <ARG1
,  
the  
radio  >>ARG1
and  
clock  
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
work*  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
for  
the  
4th  
time  >ARGM-TMP
in  
5  
months  
and  
the  
third  
time  
in  
2  
weeks  
,  
we  >ARG0
brought*  
the  
car  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
expressed*  >>ARGM-TMP
our  >ARG1
discontent*  
to  
the  
manager  <<ARG2
(  
that  >>ARG1
's*  
right*  
,  
the  
manager  
)  
,  
did*  
he  >ARG0
say*  
he  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
return*  
some  
money  <ARG1
,  
did*  
he  >ARG0
say*  
he  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
give*  
a  
discount*  
on  
our  >ARG0
next  >ARGM-ADJ
visit*  
,  
did*  
he  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
say*  
"  
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
sorry*  
"  
.  

Nope  
,  
none  
of  
the  
above  
.  

He  >>ARG0
stood*  
there  <ARG2
and  
told*  
us  <ARG2
how  >ARGM-CAU
he  >ARG1
was*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
at  
fault*  
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
the  
fault*  
of  
the  
parts  
supplier  <ARG1
,  
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
we  >ARG0
imagine*  
how  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
felt*  
having*  
to  
put*  
another  
2  
hours  <ARG1
of  
work*  
in  
the  
car  <<ARG2
.  

And  
what  >>ARG1
did*  
we  >ARG0
expect*  
...  
that  
he  >ARG0
bench  >ARGM-MNR
test*  
every  
part  <ARG1
.  

At  
no  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
during  
the  
conversation*  
did  
the  
words  >>ARG1
,  
"  
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
sorry*  
"  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
come*  
out  
of  
his  
mouth  <ARG3
.  

I  >ARG0
,  
nor  
anyone  
else  
in  
my  
family  
,  
will  >ARGM-MOD
ever  >ARGM-TMP
go*  
to  
Sun  
Devil  
Auto  <ARG4
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Well  
,  
unless  
of  
course  
the  
third  
compressor  >>ARG1
he  >ARG0
put*  
in  
the  
car  <ARG2
goes*  
out  
.  

Do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
use*  
this  
company  <ARG1
!  

I  >ARG0
dropped*  
off  
a  
sheet  
metal  
piece  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
needed*  
copied*  
due  
to  
th  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
needing*  
to  
be*  
replaced*  
.  

I  >ARG0
asked*  
if  
they  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
copy*  
the  
piece  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
dropped*  
off  
.  

They  >ARG0
said*  
it  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
made*  
exactly  
like  
the  
one  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
needed*  
to  
replace*  
.  

I  >>ARG2
picked*  
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
when  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
was*  
finished*  
and  
was*  
charge*  
30.00  <ARG1
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
got*  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
the  
job  <ARG2
and  
tried*  
to  
insert*  
the  
new  
piece  <ARG1
of  
metal  
IT  >ARG1
WOULD  >ARGM-MOD
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
FIT*  
!!  

I  >>ARG0
took*  
the  
original  
piece  <ARG1
of  
metal  
and  
rigged*  
it  <ARG1
to  
make*  
due  <ARG1
since  
I  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
complete*  
the  
job  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
took*  
the  
receipt  <ARG1
and  
the  
metal  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
fit*  
and  
asked*  
Pomper  <ARG2
for  
my  
money  <ARG1
back  
.  

The  
girl  >>ARG0
at  
the  
desk  
was*  
sooo  >ARGM-CXN
rude*  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
believe*  
it  <ARG1
!  

She  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
she  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
use*  
the  
piece  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
was*  
returning*  
and  
the  
company  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
put*  
it  <ARG1
in  
the  
trash  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
return*  
it  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
explained*  
I  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
what  >ARG3
I  >ARG0
paid*  
for  <C-ARG3
.  

She  >ARG0
asked*  
me  >ARG0
to  
bring*  
the  
original  
piece  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
and  
I  >ARG0
told*  
her  <ARG2
I  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
use*  
it  <ARG1
on  
the  
job  <ARGM-TMP
.  

She  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
that  >>ARG1
was*  
to  >ARGM-EXT
bad*  
she  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
nothing  >ARG0
to  
help*  
me  <ARG2
since  
she  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
use*  
or  
resell*  
the  
piece  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
said*  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
going*  
to  
trash*  
it  <ARG1
also  <ARGM-DIS
and  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
I  >>ARG1
at  >>ARGM-ADV
least  
have*  
a  
credit*  
.  

With  
a  
smirk  >ARGM-MNR
on  
her  
face  
she  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
NO  
MONEY  >>ARG1
IS*  
BEING*  
RETURNED*  
and  
THAT  >ARG1
IS*  
THE  
WAY*  >ARG2
IT  >ARG1
WAS*  
.  

DO*  
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
USE*  
THIS  
COMPANY  <ARG1
.  

There  
are*  
to  
many  
people  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
need*  
our  
business  <ARG1
to  
have*  
to  
put*  
up  
with  
this  
unfair  >ARGM-ADJ
treatment*  
!!!!!  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
recommend*  
this  
gym  <ARG1
to  
anyone  <ARG2
and  
unfortunately  >>ARGM-ADV
this  >>ARG1
is*  
based*  
solely  
on  
the  
owner  
's  
own  
unprofessionalism  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
originally  >ARGM-ADV
joined*  >ARGM-TMP
in  
January  <ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
did*  
so  <ARG1
because  
I  >>ARG2
was*  
told*  
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
cancel*  
the  
12  
month  
membership  <ARG1
if  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
to  
move*  
away  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >ARG0
signed*  
up  
with  
one  >>ARG1
of  
the  
staff  
who  >>R-ARG1
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
pleasant*  
and  
professional  
.  

Actually  >ARGM-ADV
working*  >>ARG1
out  
there  <ARGM-LOC
was*  
good*  
-  
the  
machines  >>ARG1
are*  
nice*  
and  
the  
classes  >>ARG1
are*  
fun*  
.  

The  
locker  
room  >>ARG0
is*  
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
lacking*  
-  
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
never  >>ARGM-NEG
shower*  
or  
change*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

They  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
update*  
the  
locker  
rooms  <ARG1
ASAP  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Back  
to  
my  >ARG1
poor  >ARG2
rating*  
-  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
excepted*  
to  
medical  
school  <ARG3
and  
went*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
to  
cancel*  
my  
membership  <ARG1
as  
I  >>ARG2
was*  
told*  
I  
could  
do*  
since  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
moving*  
away  <ARGM-DIR
.  

The  
owner  >>ARG0
was*  
VERY  >ARGM-EXT
rude*  
,  
accused*  
me  <ARG1
of  
not  >ARGM-NEG
reading*  
my  
contract  <ARG1
,  
and  
basically  >ARGM-ADV
told*  
me  >ARG1
to  
shut*  
up  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
was*  
trying*  
to  
ask*  
questions*  
to  
further  >ARGM-EXT
understand*  
the  
process*  
of  
canceling*  
my  
membership  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
able*  
to  
cancel*  
it  <ARG1
but  
only  
after  
paying*  
a  
$  
50  
fee  >>ARG1
(  
which  >>R-ARG1
the  
staff  
person  >>ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
signed*  
me  <ARG1
up  <C-V
stated*  
I  >>ARG0
would  
not  
have*  
to  
pay*  
if  
I  >>ARG0
had*  
proof*  
of  
moving*  
)  
and  
being*  
spoken*  
to  <ARG2
in  
a  
very  
belittling  
manner  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
understand*  
if  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
being*  
treated*  
this  
way*  
by  
a  
staff  
member  <<ARG0
but  
the  
club  
's  
actual  
OWNER  
?!  

Bad  
for  
business  
.  

I  >ARG1
was*  
appalled  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
recommend*  
this  
gym  <ARG1
to  
any  
woman  <ARG2
.  

The  
equipment  >>ARG1
and  
classes  
are*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
good*  >ARG2
enough*  
to  
deal*  
with  
the  
rudeness  <ARG2
from  
the  
staff  
!!!  

There  
are*  
better  
places  <ARG1
on  
the  
Cape  <ARGM-LOC

FITNESS

!  

The  
Salon  >ARG1
Experience*  
from  
Hell  <ARGM-ADJ

I  >>ARG0
feel*  
obligated  <ARG1
to  
share*  
this  
story  <ARG1
.  

Right  
out  
of  
college  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
called*  
the  
salon  <ARG1
and  
explained*  
my  
situation  <ARG1
.  

Just  >ARGM-TMP
graduated*  
,  
just  >ARGM-TMP
moved*  
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
rich*  
,  
and  
starting*  
new  
job  <ARG1
soon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
got*  
a  
price  >ARG3
quote*  
over  
the  
phone  <<ARGM-MNR
and  
they  >>ARG0
take*  
your  
cc  
info  <ARG1
just  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
make*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
appointment*  
because  
if  
you  >>ARG1
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
show*  >ARGM-ADV
up  
,  
they  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
charge*  
you  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
had*  
this  
ridiculous  
celebrity  
stylist  >ARG1
from  
LA  
named*  
Derrick  <ARG2
.  

After  
he  >ARG0
already  >ARGM-TMP
put*  >ARGM-TMP
product  <ARG1
on  
my  
hair  <ARG2
he  >ARG0
said*  
"  
I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
warn*  
you  <ARG2
,  
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
expensive*  
.  
"  

What  >>ARG1
was*  
I  >>ARG0
supposed*  
to  
do*  
,  
say*  
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
afford*  
you  <ARG1
and  
walk*  
out  <ARG2
with  
crap  <ARGM-MNR
all  
over  
my  
hair  
.  

I  >>ARG1
wanted*  
to  
be*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
blonde*  
and  
instead  >ARGM-ADV
he  >ARG0
pulled*  
my  
root  
color  <ARG1
throughout  
my  
whole  
hair  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
is*  
a  
gross  
mousey  
brown  <ARG2
.  

The  
other  
stylists  >>ARG0
around  
me  
kept*  
pressuring*  
me  <ARG1
saying*  
he  >>ARG1
's*  
so  >ARGM-EXT
wonderful*  
,  
you  >>ARG0
're*  
going*  
to  
love*  
your  
hair  <ARG1
.  

$  
400  
later  >ARGM-ADV
my  
jaw  >ARG1
dropped*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
receptionist  >ARG0
told*  
me  <ARG2
the  
total  <ARG1
.  

Derrick  >>ARG1
did*  
a  
terrible  
job  <ARG1
,  
was*  
a  
complete  
jerk  <ARG2
the  
entire  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
I  >>ARG2
had*  >ARGM-LVB
no  >ARGM-NEG
warning*  
as  
to  
the  
price*  
.  

I  >ARG0
cried*  
the  
entire  
way  
home  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >ARG0
then  >ARGM-TMP
"  
fixed*  
"  
it  <ARG1
for  
free  <ARGM-ADV
but  
it  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
looked*  
like  
crap  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
.  

It  >ARG1
was*  
the  
salon  >ARG1
experience*  
from  
absolutely  
Hell  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
told*  
me  <ARG2
that  
he  >ARG0
worked*  
on  
the  
cast  <ARG1
of  
will  
and  
grace  
and  
that  
they  >ARG1
were*  
all  <ARGM-ADV
jerks  <ARG2
.  

That  >ARG1
's*  
my  >ARG2
favorite  >ARGM-ADJ
show*  
of  
all  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
sure*  
for  
the  
cast  <ARGM-GOL
that  
it  >ARG1
was*  
the  
other  
way  
around  <ARG2
.  

Maybe  >>ARGM-DIS
he  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
a  
good  
job  <ARG1
and  
they  >ARG0
told*  
him  <ARG2
so  <ARG1
.  

Absolute  
Nightmare  
!  

STAY*  
AWAY  <ARG3
!  

Very  
unhappy  
...  

Working*  >ARG1
with  
Rod  <ARG3
Jacobsen  
was*  
my  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
experience*  
working*  
with  
a  
CPA  <ARG3
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
what  >ARG1
to  
expect*  
.  

That  >ARG1
said*  >ARGM-ADV
-  
he  >ARG1
seemed*  
to  
be*  
doing*  
well  
enough  <ARGM-MNR
.  

However  >ARGM-ADV
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
asked*  
to  
amend*  
my  >ARG0
return*  
to  
apply*  
a  
credit*  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG1
had*  
just  >>ARGM-TMP
become*  
eligible*  
for  <C-ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
expected*  
to  
pay*  
for  
this  
service*  
,  
but  
imagine  
my  >ARG1
surprise*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
received*  
a  
bill  <ARG1
for  
MORE  
than  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
paid*  
to  
have*  
the  
original  >ARGM-ADJ
return*  >ARG1
prepared*  
.  

Asked*  >ARGM-ADV
why  <ARG1
,  
Rod  >ARG0
simply  >ARGM-ADV
told*  
me  <ARG2
that  
he  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
research*  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
to  
do*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
amendment*  
(  
it  >ARG1
was*  
an  
amended  >ARG0
to  
show*  
that  
I  >>ARG0
had*  
purchased*  
a  
home  <ARG1
-  
nothing  <<ARGM-ADV
out  
of  
the  
ordinary  
,  
one  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
think*  
)  
and  
that  >ARG0
took*  
time  <ARG1
to  
figure*  
out  
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
that  >ARG1
was*  
strike*  
one  
.  

I  >>ARG0
was*  
n't  
going*  
to  
use*  
them  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
going*  
to  
leave*  
it  <ARG1
at  
that  <ARG1
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
that  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
come*  
to  
realize*  
that  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
going*  
to  
owe*  
the  
IRS  <ARG2
$  <ARG1
6,000  
+  
despite  
doing*  
exactly  
what  >>ARG1
Rod  >ARG0
told*  
me  >ARG0
to  
do*  
,  
I  >ARG0
feel*  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
voice*  
my  
opinion  <ARG1
.  

Last  
year  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
after  
all  >>ARG1
was*  
said*  >>ARGM-TMP
and  
done*  
,  
I  >ARG0
asked*  
Rod  <ARG2
whether  
my  
payment  
structure  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
leave*  
me  <ARG1
with  
no  
/  
little  
tax  
liability  <ARG1
at  
the  
end*  
of  
the  
year  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
said*  
yes  <ARG1
.  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
again  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
faced*  
with  
a  
tax  
bill  <ARG1
of  
$  
6,000  
+  
,  
all  >ARG1
due*  
on  
April  <ARGM-TMP
15  
,  
2010  
and  
all  >>ARG1
that  >>ARG1
Rod  >ARG0
has*  
to  
say*  
to  
the  
matter  <ARG3
is*  
'  
well  
,  
you  >>ARG0
wo  
n't  
have*  
to  
pay*  
a  
penalty  <ARG1
.  
'  

I  >>ARG0
may  
not  
have*  
to  
pay*  
a  
penalty  <ARG1
,  
yet  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
this  >ARG1
is*  
NOT  <ARGM-NEG
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
had*  
in  
mind  <ARGM-LOC
when  >ARGM-TMP
hired*  
these  
guys  <ARG1
.  

In  
the  
words  >ARGM-ADV
of  
my  
new  
accountant  
,  
THEY  >ARG0
LET*  
ME  <ARG1
DOWN  <C-V
!  

Bit  
sketchy  
,  
sporadic  
delivery  
times  

I  >ARG0
bought*  
about  
half  <ARG1
of  
the  
furniture  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
own*  
from  
this  
place  <<ARG2
.  

Why  
?  

Because  
they  >ARG0
cut*  
me  <ARGM-GOL
good  >ARGM-ADJ
deals*  
if  
I  >ARG0
paid*  
in  
cash  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Sketchy  
,  
right  
?  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG0
came*  
through  
and  
delivered*  
almost  
all  <ARG1
of  
my  
items  
within  
a  
few  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

(  
They  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
got*  
me  <ARG4
a  
couch  <ARG1
pretty  
quickly  <ARGM-TMP
.  
)  

The  
guy  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG0
was*  
cutting*  
me  <ARGM-GOL
the  
deals*  
and  
getting*  
me  <ARG4
the  
furniture  <ARG1
quickly  <ARGM-TMP
,  
Ahmed  
,  
was*  
nice*  
and  
mostly  
professional  
,  
except  
the  
semi-sketchiness  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Then  >ARGM-ADV
one  
day  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Ahmed  >>ARG1
left*  
the  
country  <ARG1
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
return*  
for  
months  <ARGM-TMP
,  
WITHOUT  
informing*  
me  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
neglected*  
to  
tell*  
the  
other  
person  >ARG0
working*  
at  
the  
store  <ARG2
about  
a  
dining  
room  
table  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
had*  
ordered*  
and  
that  >>R-ARG1
was*  
supposed*  
to  
be*  
coming*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
.  

The  
other  
person  >>ARG0
working*  
at  
the  
store  <ARG2
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
that  
I  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
had*  
this  
table  >ARG1
coming*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
had*  
paid*  
in  
cash  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
said*  
he  >ARG0
had*  
no  
receipt  <ARG1
/  
record  
of  
my  >ARG0
purchase*  
.  

I  >ARG1
came*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
with  
the  
receipt  >>ARG1
Ahmed  >>ARG0
had*  
provided*  
upon  
my  >ARG0
purchase*  
,  
and  
the  
guy  >>ARG0
took*  
forever  <ARG1
to  
copy*  
it  <ARG1
but  
said*  
that  
he  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
the  
situation  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG1
waited*  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
waited*  
.  

He  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
once  >ARGM-ADV
contacted*  
us  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
've*  
had*  
to  
pester*  
this  
new  
guy  <ARG1
several  
times  <ARGM-TMP
to  
ask*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
my  
table  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
arrive*  
.  

He  >>ARG1
kept*  
saying*  
different  
arrival*  
/  
delivery*  
dates  <<ARG1
and  
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem*  
terribly  
apologetic  <C-ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
has*  
been*  
3  
weeks  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG0
STILL  >>ARGM-TMP
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have*  
my  
table  >>ARG1
(  
which  >>R-ARG1
was*  
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
cheap*  
,  
I  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
add*  
)  
.  

Point  >ARG1
is*  
:  
You  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
get*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
deal*  
on  
some  
nice  
furniture  <ARG2
--  
which  
I  
did*  
--  
but  
they  >ARG1
're*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
very  
communicative  <ARG2
and  
god  >ARG0
forbid*  >ARGM-ADV
something  >ARG1
goes*  
wrong  <ARG2
,  
you  >>ARG0
'll  
have*  
to  
fight*  
to  
get*  
it  >ARG1
resolved*  
.  

Poor  >ARGM-ADJ
Service*  

Run*  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
walk*  
.  

My  >ARG0
experience*  >>ARG1
with  
Home  
Delivery  
Service  <ARG1
has*  
been*  
one  <ARG2
of  
disappointment*  
and  
anger  
.  

If  
I  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
give*  >ARGM-LVB
them  >ARG1
a  
lower  >ARGM-CXN
rating*  
than  
poor  <C-ARGM-CXN
I  
would  
.  

On  
August  >>ARGM-TMP
21st  
,  
2009  
I  >>ARG0
ordered*  
furniture  <ARG1
from  
Hickory  
Furniture  
Mart  <ARG3
and  
contracted*  
for  
HDS  >ARG0
to  
deliver*  
it  <ARG1
.  

After  
seventeen  
days  >ARGM-TMP
the  
delivery  
van  >ARG1
showed*  
up  
at  
my  
home  <ARGM-LOC
minus  
two  
pieces  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >>ARG2
was*  
later  >ARGM-TMP
told*  
they  >>ARG1
had*  
been*  
left*  
at  
the  
warehouse  <ARG2
and  
some  
future  
date  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
delivered*  
.  

No  
one  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
give*  
me  <ARG2
a  
date  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
spent*  
$  <ARG3
2300  
on  
the  
bedroom  
suite  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
was*  
complete  <ARG2
and  
excellent  
condition  
on  
the  
showroom  
floor  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Upon  
delivery*  >>ARGM-TMP
it  
was*  
clear*  
the  
entire  
set  >>ARG1
was*  
damaged*  
:  
a  
piece  >ARG1
of  
wood  
was*  
broke  <ARG2
on  
the  
headboard  <ARGM-LOC
;  
the  
chest  >>ARG0
of  
drawers  
was*  
missing*  
all  
four  
pieces  <ARG1
necessary  
to  
attach*  
the  
legs  <ARG1
;  
the  
dresser  
back  
legs  >>ARG0
were*  
pushed*  
in  <ARG2
causing*  
the  
dresser  >ARG0
to  
lean*  
into  
the  
wall  <ARG2
;  
and  
a  
nighstand  >>ARG0
was*  
missing*  
a  
drawer  <ARG1
.  

How  >>ARGM-MNR
do*  
you  >ARG0
lose*  
a  
drawer  <ARG1
.  

After  
complaining*  >>ARGM-TMP
on  
September  <ARGM-TMP
10th  
to  
National  
Home  
Furnishings  <ARG2
,  
Boyles  
,  
the  
Hickory  
Furniture  
Mart  
and  
Home  
Delivery  
Service  
the  
latter  >>ARG0
finally  >>ARGM-TMP
called*  
me  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
and  
said*  
they  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
up  <ARG2
to  
pick*  
the  
dresser  <ARG1
and  
chest  
of  
drawers  
at  
some  
future  
point  <ARGM-TMP
and  
at  
some  
later  
point  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
professional  >ARGM-MNR
repaired*  
and  
at  
some  
later  
point  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
returned*  
.  

The  
customer  >ARG2
service*  >>ARG1
at  
Home  
Delivery  
Service  <ARG0
was*  
terrible*  
let  
alone  
their  >ARG0
promise*  
to  
proper  >ARGM-MNR
set*  
up  
furniture  <ARG1
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG1
am*  
in  
limbo  <ARG2
regarding  
a  
bedroom  
suite  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
hope*  
the  
owners  >ARG0
and  
employees  
of  
this  
store  
have*  
broken  
bedroom  
suites  <ARG1
in  
their  
homes  
and  
furniture  >ARG1
sitting*  
in  
someone  
's  
warehouse  <ARG2
.  

Maybe  >ARGM-ADV
then  >ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
begin*  
to  
understand*  
poor  >ARGM-ADJ
customer  >ARG2
service*  
and  
terrible  >ARGM-ADJ
sit  >ARGM-ADJ
up  
service*  
.  

Excellent  
Driving  
School  

I  >>ARG1
was*  
involved*  
in  
a  
car  
accident  <ARG2
20  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
and  
since  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG1
've*  
been*  
a  
nervous  
wreck  <ARG2
and  
have*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
been*  
behind  
the  
wheel  <ARG2
.  

Unfortunately  >ARGM-ADV
,  
a  
family  
emergency  >ARG0
required*  
me  >ARG0
to  
conquer*  
this  
fear*  
.  

A  
very  
good  
friend  >ARG0
of  
mine  
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommended*  
the  
Professional  
Driving  
School  <ARG1
and  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
told*  
to  
specifically  >ARGM-MNR
ask*  
for  
Gerry  <ARG1
.  

She  >>ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommended*  
him  <ARG1
and  
described*  
him  <ARG1
as  
the  
"  
Saintly  
Instructor  <ARG2
and  
Simply  
the  
Best  
Instructor  >ARG1
there  
is*  
....  
very  
calm  
,  
pleasant  
and  
very  
detailed  
in  
giving*  >ARGM-LVB
instructions*  
"  
.  

I  >ARG0
called*  
the  
school  <ARG1
most  
probably  <ARGM-ADV
10  
times  <ARGM-ADV
before  
I  >ARG0
finally  >ARGM-TMP
enrolled*  
in  
a  
20  
hour  
package  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
cancel*  
my  >ARG2
initial  >ARGM-TMP
lesson*  
4  
times  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
on  
the  
5th  >ARGM-TMP
attempt*  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
management*  >>ARG0
was*  
quick*  
enough  <ARGM-CXN
to  
associate*  
my  >ARG0
cancellations*  
with  
my  >ARG0
fear*  
and  
finally  >ARGM-TMP
encouraged*  
me  <ARG1
into  
taking*  >ARGM-LVB
my  >ARGM-GOL
initial  >ARGM-TMP
lesson*  
.  

Five  
minutes  
before  
my  >ARG2
initial  >ARGM-TMP
lesson*  
,  
I  >>ARG1
got*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
call*  >ARG0
from  
Gerry  <ARG0
advising*  
me  <ARG1
of  
his  >ARG1
arrival*  
and  
to  
come*  
down  <ARGM-DIR
as  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
as  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
ready*  
.  

My  
heart  >>ARG1
pounded*  
as  
I  >ARG0
walked*  
down  <ARG2
and  
pounded*  
even  
faster  <ARGM-MNR
upon  
seeing*  
Gerry  <ARG1
in  
an  
SUV  <ARGM-LOC
-  
Lexus  
!  

I  >>ARG0
thought*  
of  
canceling*  
the  
lesson*  
once  
again  <<ARGM-TMP
because  
I  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
feel*  
comfortable  <ARG1
driving*  
an  
SUV  <ARG1
.  

Gerry  >ARG0
pleasantly  >ARGM-MNR
said*  
"  
since  
I  >ARG1
am*  
already  <ARGM-TMP
here  >>ARGM-CAU
why  >>ARGM-CAU
do*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
we  >>ARG0
give*  >ARGM-LVB
it  >ARG2
shot*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
trust*  
you  <ARG1
and  
believe*  
that  
you  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
able*  
to  
handle*  
this  <ARG1
and  
all  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
do*  
is*  
to  
reciprocate*  
!  

Trust*  
me  <ARG1
and  
most  
especially  >ARGM-ADV
trust*  
and  
believe*  
in  <ARG1
yourself  <ARG1
.  

Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
worry*  
,  
I  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  
you  <ARG1
!  
"  

.......  
the  
rest  >ARG1
was*  
history  <ARG2
!  

Here  >ARG2
I  >>ARG0
am*  
now  <ARGM-TMP
driving*  
confidently  <ARGM-MNR
on  
my  
own  <ARGM-MNR

Gerry  >ARGM-DIS

n't  >ARGM-NEG

you  >ARG0
enough  <ARGM-EXT

Restaurant  <ARG1

My  
family  >>ARG0
and  
I  
moved*  
to  
San  <ARG2
Antonio  
a  
year  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
and  
have*  
tried*  
almost  
all  <ARG1
of  
the  
Chinese  
Restaurants  
because  
we  >ARG0
love*  
Chinese  
food  <ARG1
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
it  
took*  
us  >ARG0
a  
while  <ARG1
to  
find*  
one  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
we  >ARG0
liked*  
.  

But  
we  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADV
like*  
House  <ARG1
of  
Joy  
WE  >ARG0
LOVE*  
IT  <ARG1
.  

Everything  >>ARG1
we  >>ARG0
have*  
gotten*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
has*  
been*  
more  
authentic  <ARG2
and  
better  
tasting  
than  
any  
other  
Chinese  
restaurant  >>ARG2
in  
the  
San  
Antonio  
area  
we  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
to  <C-ARG2
--  
and  
trust*  
me  <ARG1
we  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
to  
a  
lot  <ARG2
of  
them  
.  

We  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
happen*  
to  
stumble*  
across  
this  
little  
restaurant  <ARG1
one  
day  <ARGM-TMP
when  
we  >>ARG0
had*  
to  
visit*  
the  
Bexar  
County  
Tax  
Office  <ARG1
off  
of  
Bandera  
Road  
.  

We  >>ARG0
stopped*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
and  
got*  
some  
take  
out  <ARG1
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
stop*  
going*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
.  

They  >ARG0
have*  
the  
best  
Egg  
Drop  
Soup  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
tasted*  
.  

We  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
love*  
their  
Egg  
Rolls  <ARG1
and  
Spring  
Rolls  
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
every  
entree  >>ARG1
we  >>ARG0
have*  
ordered*  
is*  
perfect*  
.  

Everything  >>ARG1
is*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
cooked*  
fresh  <ARGM-MNR
and  
tastes*  
fresh*  
.  

Their  >ARG0
prices*  >>ARG1
are*  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
reasonable*  
for  
the  
amount  >ARG1
of  
food  
you  >ARG0
receive*  
.  

The  
staff  >>ARG1
is*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
just  >ARGM-DIS
so  >ARGM-EXT
pleasant*  
to  
deal*  
with  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG1
are*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
quick*  
at  
getting*  
your  >ARG0
order*  
out  <<ARG1
to  
you  
.  

You  >>ARG1
do*  
n't  
have*  
to  
sit*  
and  
wait*  
around  <ARGM-ADV
forever  <ARGM-TMP
like  
most  
places  <ARGM-ADV
!!  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
anyone  >>ARG0
looking*  
for  
an  
Excellent  
night  <ARG1
out  
for  
Chinese  
or  
maybe  
just  
lunch  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
stop*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
and  
try*  
it  <ARG1
because  
I  >ARG0
promise*  
you  <ARG1
2  
things  <ARG2
---  
You  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
regret*  
it  <ARG1
!!  

and  >ARGM-DIS
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
for  
more  <ARGM-PRP
!!!

PS  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
noticed*  
on  
here  <ARGM-LOC
that  
someone  >ARG0
left*  
a  
comment*  
that  
"  
all  >>ARG1
of  
the  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
comments*  
must  >ARGM-MOD
come*  
from  
co  
workers  <ARG3
or  
friends  
"  
and  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
tell*  
you  <ARG2
that  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
these  
people  <ARG1
except  
from  
eating*  
at  
their  
restaurant  <ARGM-LOC
.  

We  >>ARG1
are*  
from  
Virginia  <ARG2
and  
just  >ARGM-TMP
moved*  
here  <ARG2
a  
year  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

So  >>ARGM-ADV
that  
comment*  >ARG1
is*  
completely  
false  <ARG2
.  

Because  
we  >ARG0
think*  
IT  >ARG1
'S*  
THE  
BEST  <ARG2
!!!  

and  >>ARGM-DIS
we  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
them  <ARG1
except  
for  
eating*  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Dr.  >ARG1
Strzalka  
at  
Flagship  
CVTS  
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
good  
doctor  <ARG2

I  >>ARG0
am*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure*  
about  
the  
quality  <ARG1
of  
the  
other  
doctors  
there  
,  
but  
i  >>ARG0
do*  
know*  
from  
personal  >ARGM-MNR
experience*  
that  
Dr.  >>ARG0
Christopher  
T.  
Strzalka  
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
man  <ARG2
of  
his  
word  
,  
and  
is*  
also  >ARGM-ADV
very  >ARGM-EXT
CRUEL*  
AND  
UNCARING  
!!  

He  >>ARG0
was*  
going*  
to  
operate*  
and  
replace*  
my  
bicuspid  
aortic  
valve  <ARG1
due  
to  
critical  
aortic  
stenosis  <ARGM-CAU
.  

I  >ARG0
had*  
a  
surgery  
date  <ARG1
of  
July  
17  
,  
2008  
.  

Then  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
renigged*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
read*  
my  
Health  
Care  
Proxy  <ARG1
,  
even  
though  
i  >>ARG1
agreed*  
to  
be*  
on  
the  
ventilator  <ARG2
for  
2  
months  <ARGM-TMP
following  
surgery  <ARGM-TMP
(  
as  
he  >>ARG0
had*  
twice  >ARGM-TMP
stated*  
i  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
agree*  
to  <ARG1
)  
.  

He  >ARG0
later  >ARGM-TMP
said*  
that  
by  
2  
months  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
"  
meant*  
at  
least  
two  
months  <ARG2
"  
.  

Two  
months  >ARG1
and  
at  
least  
two  
months  
are*  
totally  
different  
things  <ARG2
.  

He  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
give*  
me  <ARG2
the  
chance*  
to  
say*  
i  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
stay*  
on  
the  
ventilator  <ARG3
longer  <ARGM-TMP
,  
which  
i  
would  
have*  
.  

A  
Health  
Care  
Proxy  >>ARG1
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
written*  
in  
stone  <ARGM-MNR
and  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
changed*  
.  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
never  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
said*  
he  >>ARG1
was*  
sorry*  
.  

Just  >>ARGM-DIS
said*  
i  >>ARG1
was*  
inoperable*  
and  
walked*  
out  
of  
the  
hospital  
room  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
,  
therefore  >ARGM-DIS
,  
now  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
says*  
i  >>ARG1
am*  
inoperable*  
(  
even  
though  
i  >>ARG1
am*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
100  
%  >ARGM-EXT
inoperable*  
)  
,  
and  
he  >>ARG0
is*  
letting*  
me  >ARG1
die*  
.  

I  >>ARG1
am*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
middle  >ARG2
aged*  
and  
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
die*  
,  
but  
thanks*  >ARGM-ADV
to  
this  
doctor  <ARG1
i  >ARG0
have*  
no  
other  
alternatives  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
,  
along  
with  
my  
friends  >ARGM-ADV
,  
consider*  
this  
doctor  >ARG1
to  
be*  
the  
cause  <ARG2
of  
my  >ARG1
death*  
as  
he  >>ARG0
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
trying*  
to  
save*  
my  
life  <ARG1
by  
operating*  
.  

Even  
my  
PA  >>ARG0
i  >ARG0
went*  
to  <C-ARG4
the  
other  
day  <ARGM-TMP
said*  
"  
it  
must  >ARGM-MOD
by*  
comforting  <ARG2
to  
have*  
gone*  
to  
a  
heart  
surgeon  >ARG0
like  
him  
who  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
nothing  <ARG1
for  
you  <ARG2
"  
.  

He  >ARG0
said*  
it  <ARG1
sarcastically  <ARGM-MNR
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
want*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
doctor  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
lie*  
to  
you  <ARG2
and  
say*  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
operate*  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
change*  
his  
mind  <ARG1
,  
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
what  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
is*  
talking*  
about  <C-ARG1
when  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
recommends*  
procedures*  
at  
other  
hospitals  <ARGM-LOC
and  
says*  
they  >ARG1
are*  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
need*  
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
work*  
for  
you  <ARG2
,  
go*  
to  
this  
doctor  <ARG4
...  
he  >ARG1
is*  
the  
one  <ARG2
for  
you  
.  

What  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
learn*  
from  
the  
below  >ARGM-LOC
'  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
'  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
suggest*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
avoiding*  
Second  
Home  <ARG1
based  
on  
the  
'  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  >ARGM-ADJ
'  
review*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'd  >>ARGM-MOD
probably  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
more  >ARGM-EXT
inclined*  
to  
board*  
my  
two  
dogs  <ARG0
here  <ARG1
,  
seeing*  
that  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADV
take*  
every  
dog  >ARG1
coming*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >>ARG1
've*  
toured*  
this  
place  <ARG1
and  
was*  
impressed*  
by  
how  
clean  >ARG2
the  
place  >ARG1
was*  
,  
and  
all  
the  
options  
for  
the  
dogs  
.  

It  
's*  
unfortunate*  
that  
bmil  >ARG0
believed*  
that  
his  
'  
perfect  
'  
dog  >>ARG2
was*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
given*  
the  
right  
opportunity  <ARG1
to  
prove*  
himself  <ARG1
.  

But  
I  >>ARG0
've*  
done*  
hundreds  <ARG1
of  
dog  >ARG1
introductions*  
myself  <<ARGM-REC
(  
another  
place  
,  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
work*  
here  <ARG2
)  
,  
and  
owners  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  >>ARGM-LVB
unrealistic  >>ARGM-MNR
expectations*  
and  
views*  
of  
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
see*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
their  
dogs  >ARG0
meet*  
other  
dogs  <ARG1
.  

Workers  >>ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
do*  
these  
introductions*  
look*  
at  
the  
interaction*  
objectively  <<ARGM-MNR
;  
and  
it  >>ARG0
's*  
good*  
to  
see*  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
able*  
and  
willing*  
to  
say*  
no  <ARG1
if  
they  >ARG0
feel*  
there  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
problem  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
sounds*  
(  
according  
to  
your  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-ADJ
statement*  
)  
that  
they  >ARG0
had*  
a  
roomful  <ARG1
of  
dogs  
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
doing*  
something  <ARG1
right  <ARGM-MNR
-  
and  
are*  
keeping*  
those  
dogs  >ARG1
safe*  
from  
potential  
problems  <ARG2
.  

You  >ARG0
say*  
you  >ARG0
work*  
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT
,  
and  
that  
you  >ARG0
have*  
a  
young  
dog  <ARG1
;  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
have*  >ARGM-LVB
little  >ARGM-ADJ
doubt*  
that  
your  
dog  >>ARG0
is*  
just  >ARGM-ADV
filled*  
with  
energy  >ARG1
to  
burn*  
;  
and  
it  
is*  
good*  
of  
you  <ARGM-CAU
to  
look*  
for  
a  
place  >ARG3
to  
take*  
him  <ARG1
.  

But  
not  
at  
a  
risk*  
to  
other  
people  
's  
pets  <ARG2
.  

You  >>ARG2
were*  
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
given*  
another  
alternative  <ARG1
by  
Second  
Home  <ARG0
,  
to  
board*  
him  <ARG0
-  
which  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
given*  
your  
dog  <ARG2
a  
chance*  
to  
come*  
and  
go*  
from  
Second  
Home  <ARG3
a  
couple  
times  <ARGM-TMP
,  
getting*  
used*  
to  
the  
place  <ARG1
and  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
facilitating*  
another  
attempt*  
to  
get*  
into  
daycare  <ARG2
later  <ARGM-TMP
.  

No  
business  >>ARG0
is*  
going*  
to  
push*  
customers  <ARG1
away  <ARG2
without  
good  
reason  <ARGM-CAU
;  
so*  >ARGM-DIS
is  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
it  <ARG1
reasonable*  
to  
think*  
they  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
know*  
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
're*  
doing*  
?  

My  
dogs  >ARG1
are*  
far  <ARG2
from  
perfect  
,  
and  
one  >>ARG1
of  
them  
I  >ARG0
believe*  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
little  
much  <ARG2
for  
daycare  
here  
herself  <ARGM-REC
(  
at  <ARGM-ADV
least  
initially  
)  
.  

Be*  
a  
little  
more  >ARGM-EXT
reasonable*  
with  
your  >ARG0
expectations*  
of  
a  
place  <ARG1
like  
this  
;  
and  
maybe  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
jump*  
to  
personal  >ARGM-ADJ
attacks*  >ARG0
suggesting*  
that  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
work*  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
,  
just  
because  
you  >ARG0
bruised*  
your  
own  
ego  <ARG1
.  

Dumbest  
F'ers  
ever  

I  >ARG0
called*  
dominos  <ARG1
tonight  <ARGM-TMP
,  
it  >ARG1
rang*  
forever  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
get*  
put*  
on  
hold*  
twice  <<ARGM-TMP
without  
saying*  
a  
word  <ARG1
and  
FINALLY  >ARGM-TMP
someone  >ARG0
says*  
,  
MAY  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
HELP*  
YOU  <ARG2
?  

So  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
say*  
:  
I  >ARG1
'm*  
at  
the  
Radison  
Warwick  
hotel  >ARG1
in  
Rittenhouse  
Square  
(  
built*  
in  
1926  <ARGM-TMP
)  
do*  
you  >ARG0
deliver*  
to  
the  
Warwick  <ARG2
?  

They  >ARG0
say*  
no  
,  
Warwick  <ARG1
in  
New  
Jersey  
,  
Call*  
New  
Jersey  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
laugh*  
and  
say*  
,  
no  >ARGM-DIS
,  
that  
Warwick  >ARG1
is*  
in  
New  
York  <ARG2
,  
but  
I  >ARG1
'm*  
at  
the  
Radison  
-  
Warwick  <ARG2
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
he  >ARG0
says*  
:  
You  >ARG1
're*  
at  
Warwick  <ARG2
in  
Pennsylvania  
?  

and  
I  >ARG0
said*  
,  
YES  
,  
CENTER  
CITY  
PHILLY  <ARG1
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
says*  
,  
NO  >ARGM-DIS
,  
Warwick  >ARG1
is*  
a  
township  <ARG2
,  
If  
you  >ARG1
're*  
at  
a  
Radison  >>ARGM-ADV
in  
Warwick  
that  >>ARG1
s*  
too  >ARGM-EXT
far*  
,  
try*  
dominos  <ARG1
in  
Pottstown  
.  

I  >ARG0
say*  
,  
NO  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG1
am*  
at  
the  
RADISON  
WARWICK  
HOTEL  <ARG2
in  
Rittenhouse  
Square  
.  

He  >ARG0
says*  
:  
I  >ARG0
not  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
that  
town  <ARG1
,  
I  >>ARG1
have*

You  >ARG1

I  >ARG0

I  >ARG1

3  
blocks

and  
one  
south  
of

Hmmm  
,  
she  >ARG0
says*  
,  
Then  
why  >>ARGM-CAU
are*  
you  >ARG0
calling*  
here  <ARG1
,  
we  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
past  
broad  <ARG1
?  

Anyway  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
after  
much  >>ARGM-ADJ
yelling*  >>ARGM-TMP
and  
cussing*  
I  >>ARG0
hung*  
up  
,  
grabbed*  
a  
cab  <ARG1
,  
and  
went*  
to  
Geno  <ARG4
's  
.  

Quick  
to  
take*  
money  <ARG1
but  
not  
quick  
to  
fix*  
a  
problem  <ARG1
!  

B&B  >>ARG0
came*  
out  <ARGM-DIR
very  
quickly  <ARGM-TMP
to  
give*  
us  <ARG2
our  >ARGM-GOL
quote*  
back  
in  
June  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >>ARG0
were*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
polite*  
,  
eager*  
to  
answer*  
any  
questions*  
and  
willing*  
to  
wait*  
for  
us  >ARG1
to  
return*  
from  
vacation*  
to  
begin*  
installing*  
our  
fence  <ARG1
.  

Our  
fence  >>ARG1
was*  
installed*  
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
in  
August  <ARGM-TMP
and  
they  >>ARG0
had*  
their  
money  <ARG1
and  
left*  
saying*  
"  
Workmanship  >>ARG1
is*  
guaranteed*  
for  
a  
year  <ARGM-TMP
!  
"  
.  

Within  
a  
week  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
noticed*  
one  >ARG1
of  
the  
boards  
on  
our  
gate  
splitting*  
where  >>ARGM-LOC
a  
nail  >>ARG1
had*  
gone*  
in  <ARGM-DIR
.  

We  >ARG0
called*  
our  
representative  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
assured*  
me  <ARG1
he  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
call*  
the  
office  <ARG1
and  
have*  
it  >>ARG1
taken*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  <C-ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
heard*  
nothing  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
then  >ARGM-TMP
called*  
the  
office  <ARG1
and  
the  
man  >>ARG0
we  >ARG0
spoke*  
to  <C-ARG2
said*  
he  >>ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
send*  
someone  >ARG0
out  <ARGM-DIR
to  
look*  
at  
it  <ARG1
but  
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
promise*  
when  <ARGM-TMP
-  
two  
weeks  >>ARG1
came*  
and  
went*  
and  
we  >ARG0
heard*  
nothing  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG2
just  >>ARGM-TMP
called*  
again  <ARGM-TMP
and  
was*  
told*  
that  
workmanship  >>ARG1
,  
not  
wood  
,  
is*  
guaranteed*  
for  
a  
year  <ARGM-TMP
-  
well  >ARGM-DIS
in  
my  
opinion  >ARGM-ADV
-  
the  
wood  >ARG1
split*  
due  
to  
a  
nail  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
is*  
part  <ARG2
of  
workmanship  
!  

She  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-DIS
went*  
so  
far  <ARGM-ADV
as  
to  
say*  
"  
You  >>ARG0
r*  
calling*  
about  
one  
board  <ARGM-PRP
?  
"  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
-  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
pay*  >ARGM-TMP
over  
$  <ARG1
1000  
for  
something  <ARG3
you  >ARG0
want*  
it  >>ARG1
to  
hold*  
up  
and  
look*  
good*  
!!!  

YES  
!  

I  >>ARG0
WAS*  
calling*  
about  
one  
board  <ARGM-PRP
!!  

I  >>ARG1
'm*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
frustrated*  
at  
this  
point  <ARGM-TMP
-  
it  
would  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
all  
of  
10  
min  <ARG1
for  
them  >>ARG0
to  
come*  
by  <ARGM-DIR
and  
replace*  
the  
one  
board  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is*  
cracked*  
(  
the  
crack  >>ARG1
is*  
deep*  
enough  <ARGM-CXN
to  
stick*  
a  
penny  <ARG1
in  
it  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
goes*  
clear  
through  <ARGM-DIR
)  
yet  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
take*  
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
bother*  
with  
what  >>ARG1
once  >>ARGM-TMP
WAS*  
a  
happy  
customer  <ARG2
and  
has*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
become*  
a  
dissatisfied  
customer  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
figure*  
if  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
take*  
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
fix*  
the  
fence  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
they  >ARG0
installed*  
then  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
let*  
everyone  >ARG0
I  
can  
know*  
about  
how  >ARG2
they  >ARG0
treat*  
customers  <ARG1
once  
they  >ARG0
have*  
your  
money  <ARG1
!!!  

STAY*  
AWAY  <ARG3
!!!  

YOU  >ARG0
GET*  
WHAT  >ARG3
YOU  >ARG0
PAY*  
FOR  <C-ARG3
!!!  

They  >ARG1
came*  
in  
under  
a  
lot  <ARG2
of  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
quotes*  
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
know*  
why  <ARG1
!!!  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
fence  >>ARG1
was*  
first  >ARGM-TMP
installed*  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
given*  
them  <ARG2
five  
stars  <ARG1
,  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
for  
their  
poor  >ARGM-ADJ
customer  >ARG1
follow*  
-  
up  >>ARGM-CAU
and  
unwillingness  
to  
fix*  
the  
fence  <ARG1
they  >>ARG1
have*  
dropped*  
to  
a  
one  
-  
star  <ARG4
in  
my  
opinion  <ARGM-ADV
!  

Lots  
of  
rules*  
,  
phantom  
innkeeper  
,  
last  
minute  >ARGM-TMP
price*  >>ARG1
was*  
worth*  
it  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
called*  
the  
"  
207  
"  
number  <ARG1
and  
listened*  
to  
the  
same  
recording  
loop  <ARG1
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
before  
I  >ARG0
gave*  
up  
.  

I  >>ARG0
then  >>ARGM-TMP
called*  
the  
800  
number  <ARG1
(  
which  >>ARG1
was*  
answered*  
)  
and  
inquired*  
about  
last  
minute  
rates  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
had*  
a  
room  >ARG1
with  
a  
$  
99  
rate  
,  
which  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
booked*  
.  

The  
room  >>ARG1
was*  
supposed*  
to  
be*  
on  
the  
2nd  
floor  <ARG2
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
put*  
us  <ARG1
on  
the  
3rd  <ARG2
.  

The  
email  >ARGM-MNR
confirmation*  >>ARG0
(  
which  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
read*  
in  
the  
car  <ARGM-LOC
)  
warned*  
about  
large  
suitcases  <ARG1
,  
declaring*  
that  
we  >ARG1
are*  
innkeepers  <ARG2
,  
not  
longshoreman  
.  

In  
other  
words  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
help*  
with  
suitcases  <ARG1
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
promise*  
totes  >ARG0
to  
help*  
.  

However  
upon  
our  >ARG1
arrival*  
no  
one  
there  
(  
the  
inn  >>ARG1
was*  
open*  
)  
.  

So  
no  
totes  
.  

Finally  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
chambermaid  >>ARG0
stuck*  
her  
head  <ARG1
around  
the  
corner  <ARG2
from  
the  
top  <ARGM-DIR
of  
the  
stairs  
and  
told*  
us  <ARG2
sternly  <ARGM-MNR
that  
we  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be*  
accommodated*  
until  
3  
M  <ARGM-TMP
,  
no  >ARGM-NEG
exceptions*  
.  

Then  >>ARGM-TMP
she  >>ARG1
was*  
gone*  
.  

We  >>ARG0
returned*  
after  
3  
PM  <ARGM-TMP
,  
found*  
no  
one  <ARG1
there  
,  
and  
a  
note  
from  
the  
innkeeper  
with  
directions*  
to

Quit*

The  
worst  
thing  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
happen*  
for  
any  
restaurant  <ARG2
like  
Zahav  
is*  
to  
have*  
too  
many  
people  >ARG0

hyperbolic  >ARGM-ADJ
reviews*  >>ARG0

claims*  
that  
"  
everyone  >>ARG0

is*  
going*  
to  
"  
love*  
"  
the  
food  <ARG1
,  
decor  
and  
service*  
.  

The  
truth  >ARG1
is*  
,  
in  
my  >ARG0
and  
my  
dining  
partners  
'  
experience*  
,  
this  >ARG1
is*  
a  
fine  
little  
restaurant  <ARG2
with  
some  
unique  
food  
.  

It  >ARG1
's*  
an  
entirely  
up  >ARGM-ADJ

down  
experience*  
,  
however  <<ARGM-DIS
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
best  >ARG1
of  
that  
unique  
food  
comes*  
at  
the  
very  >ARGM-ADJ
beginning*  
of  
the  
meal  <ARG1
.  

The  
salatim  
salads  >ARG1
are*  
the  
smallest  
plates  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
've*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
seen*  
placed*  
in  
front  <ARG2
of  
me  
(  
you  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
most  
likely  >ARGM-ADV
think*  
they  >ARG1

condiments  <ARG2

it  >>ARG1

they  >>ARG1

n't  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
enough  
forkfuls  >ARGM-ADV
to  
know*  
if  
you  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
love*  
them  <ARG1
.  

That  >>ARG1
being*  
said*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
laffa  >ARG1
and  
hummus  
are*  
out  
of  
this  
world  <ARG2
.  

Then  
again  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
for  
the  
three  >>ARGM-GOL
of  
us  
who  >R-ARG0
dined*  
together  <ARGM-ADV
,  
two  
pieces  >ARG0
of  
flatbread  
left*  
us  >>ARG0
fighting*  
for  
more  <ARG2
,  
and  
licking*  
the  
hummus  <ARG1
from  
our  
fingers  <ARGM-DIR
(  
and  >>ARGM-DIS
yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
those  
two  
pieces  >>ARG0
of  
flatbread  
did*  
represent*  
a  
three  
-  
person  >ARG2
order*  
)  
.  

Dinner  >ARG1
was*  
also  <ARGM-ADV
an  
up  >ARGM-ADJ
-  
and  
-  
down  
experience*  
.  

The  
vegetarian  
dishes  >ARG1
and  
lighter  
fare  
were*  
almost  
always  <ARGM-TMP
spot  
-  
on  <ARG2
,  
while  
the  
lamb  >ARG1
was*  
often  <ARGM-TMP
dry  <ARG2
and  
/  
or  
overcooked  
.  

The  
duck  >ARG1
was*  
a  
65  
%  
glob  <ARG2
of  
chewy  
fat  
with  
no  
resemblance  
to  
the  
juicy  
,  
crispy  
delicacy  >ARG1
it  >ARG0
usually  >ARGM-TMP
represents*  
at  
other  
establishments  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Dessert  >ARG1
was*  
...  
hmmm  
,  
that  >>ARG2
's*  
interesting*  
,  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
remember*  
dessert  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
guess*  
that  >ARG0
tells*  
you  <ARG2
a  
lot  <ARG1
.  

Oh  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
chocolate  
semifreddo  >>ARG1
was*  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
good*  
.  

The  
warm  
chocolate  
cake  >>ARG1
was*  
very  
tasty  <ARG2
,  
but  
served*  
at  
room  
temperature  <ARGM-MNR
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
warm*  
by  
any  
stretch  <ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
imagination*  
.  

And  
my  
--  
no  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
remember*  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
had*  
.  

Service*  >ARG1
was*  
average  <ARG2
,  
but  
nothing  
special  
,  
and  
restaurants  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG1
are*  
supposed*  
to  
be*  
excellent*  
should  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
a  
better  
job  <ARG1
of  
training*  
their  
waitstaff  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
communicative  <ARG2
and  
friendly*  
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
merely  >ARGM-EXT
capable*  
.  

Perhaps  >>ARGM-ADV
had  
we  >>ARG0
not  >ARGM-NEG
gone*  >>ARGM-ADV
into  
this  
restaurant  <ARG4
believing*  
Zahav  >>ARG1
was*  
going*  
to  
be*  
golden  <ARG2
as  
its  
name  >ARG0
suggests*  
(  
and  
as  
the  
many  >ARGM-ADJ
golden  >ARGM-ADJ
reviews*  >>ARG0
seem*  
to  
attest*  
)  
,  
we  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
enjoyed*  
a  
decent  >ARGM-ADJ
little  >ARGM-ADJ
expensive  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
one  >>ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
go*  
here  <ARG4
expecting*  
something  <ARG1
fantastic  
,  
unless  
perhaps  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
've*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
had*  
middle  
-  
eastern  
food  <ARG1
before  <ARGM-TMP
,  
or  
succulent  
duck  <C-ARG1
,  
tasty  
lamb  <C-ARG1
,  
decent  >ARGM-ADJ
portion  >ARG1
sizes*  
or  
actually  
warm  
chocolate  
desserts  <<C-ARG1
.  

PS  
)  
When  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
called*  >>ARGM-TMP
for  
a  
reservation*  
,  
we  >>ARG2
were*  
told*  
that  
5:00  >ARG1
and  
9:30  
were*  
their  >ARG1
only  >ARGM-ADJ
openings*  
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG0
arrived*  >>ARGM-TMP
at  
5  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
left*  
circa  
7  <ARGM-TMP
,  
there  
were*  
the  
same  
4  
or  
5  
empty  
tables  >ARG1
surrounding*  
us  <ARG2
.  

Did*  
they  >ARG0
think*  
we  >>ARG1
were*  
going*  
to  
feel*  
lucky*  
to  
get*  >ARGM-LVB
any  
reservation*  
at  
all  <ARGM-EXT
,  
and  
therefore  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
more  >ARGM-EXT
pleased*  
with  
our  >ARG0
dining  >ARG1
experience*  
?  

MUST  >ARGM-MOD
READ*  
-  
Do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
waste*  
your  
time  <ARG1
in  
this  
store  <ARGM-LOC
.  

At  
my  >ARG0
appointment*  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
girl  >>ARG0
helping*  
me  <ARG2
was*  
unable*  
to  
adequately  >ARGM-MNR
lace*  
up  <ARGM-PRD
some  <ARG1
of  
the  
dresses  
.  

They  >ARG0
felt*  
like  
they  >>ARG1
were*  
going*  
to  
fall*  
off  <ARGM-DIR
of  
me  
and  
it  
was*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
difficult*  
to  
see*  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
actually  >ARGM-ADV
look*  
like  <C-ARG1
were  <ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
to  
purchase*  
some  <ARG1
of  
these  
dresses  
.  

I  >ARG0
thought*  
it  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
good  
idea  <ARG2
to  
see*  
how  >>ARG1
a  
few  >>ARG0
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
liked*  
would  >ARGM-MOD
look*  
like  <C-ARG1
on  
a  
model  <ARGM-LOC
(  
by  
looking*  
the  
dress  <ARG1
up  <C-V
online  <ARG2
)  
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
as  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
leaving*  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
asked*  
for  
the  
designer  
/  
dress  
name  >ARG1
or  
style  
number  
associated*  
with  
my  
top  
picks  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG0
said*  
they  >>ARG0
were*  
"  
unable*  
to  
tell*  
me  <ARG2
until  
they  >ARG0
ordered*  
my  
dress  <ARG1
"  
.  

Hmmm  >>ARGM-DIS
...  
A  
person  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
call*  
a  
company  <ARG1
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
have*  
no  
idea  <ARG1
its  
name  
(  
since  
the  
designer  >>ARG1
is*  
unknown*  
...  
SUPPOSEDLY  <ARGM-ADV
)  
,  
and  
order*  
a  
gown  <ARG1
without  
a  
dress  
name  <ARGM-ADV
or  
style  
number  
.  

Do*  
other  
brides  >ARG1
fall*  
for  
this  <ARG2
???  

They  >>ARG0
either  
:  
a  
)  
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
give*  
it  <ARG1
to  
me  <ARG2
because  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
me  >ARG0
purchasing*  
the  
dress  <ARG1
elsewhere  <ARGM-LOC
or  
b  
)  
are*  
recreating*  
the  
dresses  <ARG1
themselves  <ARGM-REC
(  
ie  >>ARGM-DIS
STEALING*  
other  
designers  >ARG0
'  
dress  >ARG1
designs*  
and  
"  
filling*  
the  
orders*  
"  
by  
their  
own  
seamstresses  <<ARGM-MNR
)  
.  

I  >ARG1
'm*  
no  
detective  <ARG2
but  
...  
uhh  
...  
seriously  
?!?  

Whatever  
type  >>ARG1
of  
operation*  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
running*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
interested*  
and  
if  
you  >>ARG1
're*  
smart*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
you  >ARG1
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
be*  
either  <ARGM-ADV
.  

What  
a  
waste*  
of  
TIME  <ARG1
.  

Aside  >ARGM-ADV
from  
that  
little  
*  
mystery  
*  
,  
one  >>ARG0
of  
the  
sales  
ladies  
was*  
quite  
comfortable  <ARG2
telling*  
me  <ARG2
how  
wrong  >ARG2
I  >ARG1
was*  
about  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
another  
dress  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
loved*  
compared*  
to  
one  >>ARG1
of  
her  
dresses  
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
was*  
trying*  
on  <ARGM-PRD
.  

Somehow  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
since  
she  >>ARG0
supposedly  >>ARGM-ADV
does*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  >>ARGM-CAU
any  
names  <ARG1
of  
designers  
/  
dresses  
,  
after  
I  >ARG0
told*  >>ARGM-TMP
her  <ARG2
the  
designer  
and  
dress  
name  <ARG1
of  
the  
one  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
was*  
comparing*  
,  
she  >>ARG0
knew*  
"  
exactly  
which  
dress  >>ARG1
"  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
referring*  
to  <C-ARG1
and  
disagreed*  
with  
my  >ARG0
observation*  
;  
she  >ARG0
said*  
that  
the  
bodice  >>ARG1
did*  
come*  
as  
low  <ARG2
as  
the  
one  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
had*  
on  <ARGM-PRD
.  

My  
point  
:  
Even  
if  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
wrong*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
do*  
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
sit*  
there  <ARG2
and  
argue*  
with  
the  
customer  <ARG1
.  

Say*  
something  <ARG1
like  
,  
"  
Huh  
.  

I  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think*  
so  <ARG1
but  
you  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
right*  
.  
"  

Unless  
you  >>ARG0
want*  
to  
take*  
the  
"  
tell*  >>ARGM-ADJ
the  
customer  >ARG2
how  
wrong  >R-ARG2
she  >ARG1
is*  
and  
try*  
and  
force*  
her  <ARG1
into  
a  
dress  >>ARG1
she  >>ARG0
's*  
obviously  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG
loving*  
"  
approach*  
which  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
likely  >ARGM-ADV
get*  
you  <ARG1
...  
uh  <ARGM-DIS
...  
nowhere  <ARG2
.  

Seriously  
:  
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
waste*  
your  
time  <ARG1
.  

Other  
shops  >ARG0
around  
this  
city  
have*  
MUCH  
NICER  
and  
more  
TRANSPARENT  
owners  <ARG1
.  

Not  
owners  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
seem*  
like  
they  >>ARG0
have*  
something  >ARG1
to  
hide*  
and  
know*  
nothing  <ARG1
about  
common  
courtesy  
and  
customer  >ARG2
service*  
.  

I  >ARG0
felt*  
very  
much  
like  
Wedding  
Gallery  >>ARG1
was*  
being*  
dishonest*  
and  
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
trust*  
them  >ARG0
to  
lace*  
me  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-PRD
in  
another  
gown  <ARGM-LOC
let  
alone  
trust*  
them  <ARG2
with  
the  
gown  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
wear*  
on  
the  
most  
important  
day  <ARGM-TMP
of  
my  
life  
.  

AWFUL  >ARGM-ADJ
SERVICE*  
!  

After  
happily  >ARGM-MNR
visiting*  >>ARGM-TMP
Sear's  
Automotives  <ARG1
in  
the  
past  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
shocked*  
at  
the  
horrible  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  >ARG1
received*  
at  
their  
Greensboro  
location  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
brought*  
my  
car  <ARG1
in  <ARG3
on  
a  
Sunday  <ARGM-TMP
to  
replace*  
a  
shredded*  
tire  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
waited*  
about  
20  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
store  
part  <ARGM-LOC
before  
anyone  >>ARG0
was*  
able*  
to  
assist*  
me  <ARG1
and  
was*  
then  >ARGM-TMP
told*  
to  
pull*  
my  
car  <ARG1
into  
the  
shop  <ARG2
(  
that  >ARG1
is*  
apparently  <ARGM-ADV
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
are*  
supposed*  
to  
do*  
,  
but  
the  
big  
signs  >>ARG1
pointing*  
you  <ARG1
that  
way*  
are*  
for  
some  
reason  >ARGM-PRP
kept*  
inside  
the  
garage  <ARG2
,  
so  >>ARGM-DIS
you  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see*  
them  <ARG1
drving*  
up  <ARGM-DIR
,  
and  
they  >ARG0
purposely  >ARGM-MNR
block*  
the  
front  
pull  
-  
up  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
all  
other  
Sear's  >ARG0
use*  
)  
.  

Once  
inside  
,  
I  >>ARG1
had*  
to  
stand*  
around  <ARG2
for  
at  
least  
10  
more  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
before  
--  
FINALLY  >ARGM-TMP
--  
a  
technician  >ARG1
got*  
to  
me  <ARG2
.  

Once  
I  >>ARG0
returned*  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
pick*  
up  
my  
car  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
believe*  
I  >>ARG1
spent*  
quite  
a  
bit  
MORE  
time  <ARG1
standing*  
around  <ARG2
waiting*  
.  

I  >>ARG2
had*  
wanted*  
to  
split*  
the  
total  <ARG1
between  
a  
credit  
card  <ARG2
and  
check  
card  
since  
I  >>ARG2
was*  
being*  
reimbursed*  
for  
the  
tire  <ARG3
but  
was*  
told*  
this  >>ARG1
was*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
possible*  
.  

Once  
I  >ARG1
actually  >ARGM-ADV
got*  >>ARGM-TMP
back  <ARGM-PRD
in  
my  
car  <ARG2
,  
it  >>ARG0
was*  
dirty*  
and  
had*  
grease  <ARG1
all  
over  
the  
steering  
wheel  
.  

OK  
,  
one  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
...  
fine  
.  

The  
following  
Friday  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
returned*  
with  
my  
car  <ARGM-MNR
to  
go*  
ahead  <ARG2
and  
replace*  
the  
other  
3  
tires  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
were*  
worn  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
have*  
gone*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
find*  
the  
particular  
tire  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
'd*  
used*  
in  
stock  <<ARGM-PRD
anywhere  <<ARGM-LOC
else  
.  

Once  
again  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG1
waited*  
for  
quite  
a  
bit  <ARGM-TMP
before  
being*  
attended*  
to  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
got*  
the  
order*  >ARG1
completed*  
,  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
questioned*  
the  
technician  <ARG1
since  
it  >ARG1
came*  
out  
about  
$  <ARG2
40  
less  
than  
I  >ARG0
expected*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
said*  
it  >>ARG0
was*  
the  
same  
tire  <ARG2
,  
and  
verified*  
this  <ARG1
,  
after  
checking*  
both  
the  
actual  
tire  <ARG1
on  
my  
car  
and  
my  
service  
papers  
from  
earlier  
in  
the  
week  
.  

However  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
printed*  >>ARGM-TMP
out  
the  
service  >ARG3
quote*  
,  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
see*  
that  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
NOT  <ARGM-NEG
the  
correct  
tire  <ARG2
,  
and  
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
even  <ARGM-ADV
an  
appropriate  
tire  <ARG2
for  
my  
car  
model  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
pointed*  
this  <ARG1
out  <C-V
to  
him  <ARGM-GOL
,  
at  
which  
point  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
said*  
they  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
had*  
one  <ARG1
of  
the  
correct  
tires  
in  
stock  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Ok  
--  
fine  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
got*  
just  <ARGM-TMP
my  
other  
rear  
tire  >ARG1
replaced*  
.  

They  >ARG0
promised*  
it  >>ARG1
'd  
be*  
done*  
within  
an  
hour  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG1
waited*  
in  
the  
lobby  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Over  
two  
hours  
later  >>ARGM-TMP
(  
and  
ten  
minutes  
before  
they  >ARG1
closed*  
)  
my  
car  >>ARG1
was*  
finally  >ARGM-TMP
finished*  
.  

A  
few  
minutes  
after  
I  >ARG0
left*  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
called*  
and  
informed*  
that  
"  
I  >ARG0
"  
left*  
my  
wheel  
lock  >>ARG1
(  
which  >>R-ARG1
they  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
left*  
in  
the  
car  <ARG2
)  
.  

Of  >>ARGM-DIS
course  
,  
they  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
closing*  
in  
5  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  
I  >>ARG0
would  
have*  
to  
hurry*  
up  <ARGM-PRD
or  
get*  
it  <ARG1
the  
next  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Of  >ARGM-DIS
course  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
make*  
it  
back  <ARG1
in  
time  <ARGM-TMP
(  
and  
they  >>ARG1
apparently  >ARGM-ADV
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
stay*  
5  
extra  
minutes  <ARG3
to  
wait*  
for  
me  <ARG2
)  
.  

The  
next  
day  >ARGM-TMP
,  
no  
one  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
find*  
my  
wheel  
lock  <ARG1
and  
that  
particular  
technician  >ARG1
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
in  <ARG2
.  

Of  >ARGM-DIS
course  
,  
they  >>ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
call*  
him  <ARG1
either  <ARGM-ADV
to  
ask*  
about  
it  <ARG1
because  
apparently  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
keep*  
their  
employees  
'  
phone  
numbers  <ARG1
(  
riiight  
)  
,  
so  
I  >>ARG0
would  
have*  
to  
return*  
on  
Monday  <ARGM-TMP
(  
driving*  
for  
3  
days  <ARGM-TMP
now  <ARGM-TMP
with  
no  
wheel  
lock  <ARGM-MNR
should  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
get*  
a  
flat  <ARG1
)  
.  

On  
Monday  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
called*  
and  
again  >ARGM-TMP
it  
was*  
a  
big  
to  
-  
do  <ARG2
to  
find*  
anyone  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
knew*  
anything  <ARG1
about  
it  
.  

Supposedly  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
holding*  
it  <ARG1
for  
me  <ARG2
this  
evening  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
I  >>ARG0
'm*  
sure*  
that  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
a  
huge  
ordeal  <ARG2
.  

The  
employees  >ARG1
at  
this  
Sear's  
are*  
completely  
apathetic  <ARG2
and  
there  >>ARG1
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem*  
to  
be*  
any  
sort  <ARG2
of  
management*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
see*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
return*  
there  <ARG4
again  <ARGM-TMP
(  
and  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
have*  >ARGM-LVB
some  
serious  >ARGM-ADJ
doubts*  
about  
the  
quality  <ARG1
of  
work*  >ARGM-PRR
they  <ARG0
actually  <ARGM-ADV
performed*  
on  
my  
car  <<ARG1
)  
.
