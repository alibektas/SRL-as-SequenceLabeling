DPA  
:  
Iraqi  
authorities  >ARG0
announced  V01
that  
they  >>ARG0
had  V01
busted  V04
up  
3  
terrorist  
cells  >ARG0
operating  V01
in  
Baghdad  <ARGM-LOC

Two  >>>ARG1
of  
them  
were  V03
being  V03
run  V01
by  
2  
officials  <ARG0
of  
the  
Ministry  
of  
the  
Interior  
!  

The  
MoI  >>ARG1
in  
Iraq  
is  V01
equivalent  V01
to  
the  
US  
FBI  <ARG2
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
this  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
like  
having  V04
J.  >ARG0
Edgar  
Hoover  
unwittingly  >ARGM-MNR
employ  V01
at  
a  
high  
level  <ARGM-ADV
members  <ARG1
of  
the  
Weathermen  
bombers  
back  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
1960s  <ARGM-TMP

The  
third  >>>ARG1
was  V03
being  V03
run  V01
by  
the  
head  <ARG0
of  
an  
investment  
firm  
.  

You  >ARG0
wonder  V01
if  
he  >>ARG0
was  V03
manipulating  V02
the  
market  <ARG1
with  
his  
bombing  
targets  <ARGM-MNR

The  
cells  >>ARG0
were  V03
operating  V01
in  
the  
Ghazaliyah  
and  
al

Jihad  
districts  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
capital

Although  
the  
announcement  V01
was  V03
probably  
made  VLV
to  
show  V01
progress  V01
in  
identifying  V01

breaking  V08
up  
terror

very

reminds  V01
me  <ARG2

Al

Zaman  
:  
The  
Iraqi  
High  
Electoral  
Commission  >ARG0
on  
Friday  >ARGM-TMP
denied  V01
a  
request  V01
of  
the  
Debaathification  
Commission  <ARG0
to  
exclude  V01
51  
individuals  <ARG1
from  
running  V02
on  
party  
lists  <ARG1
in  
the  
Dec.  >ARGM-TMP
15  
elections  V01
on  
grounds  <<ARGM-CAU
of  
having  V01
been  V01
sufficiently  >ARGM-EXT
involved  V01
in  
Baath  
activities  <ARG2
to  
warrant  V01
their  >>ARG1
being  V03
excluded  V01
from  
civil  
office  <ARG2
.  

The  
Commission  >ARG0
said  V01
it  >ARG0
had  V03
no  
legal  
grounds  <ARG1
for  
such  
an  
exclusion  V01
.  

This  
item  >>ARG1
is  V01
a  
small  
one  <ARG2
and  
easily  >ARGM-MNR
missed  V02
.  

But  >>>ARGM-DIS
in  
my  >ARG0
view  V02
it  >>ARG1
is  V01
highly  >ARGM-EXT
significant  V02
.  

The  
Debaathification  
Commission  >>>ARG0
had  V01
been  V03
pushed  V01
by  
Ahmad  <ARG0
Chalabi  
and  
his  
Iraqi  
National  
Congress  
very  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
had  V01
pushed  V01
many  
Sunni  
Arabs  <ARG1
into  
the  
arms  <ARG2
of  
the  
guerrillas  
.  

Chalabi  >>>ARG1
has  V01
been  V03
increasingly  >ARGM-MNR
marginalized  V01
within  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
,  
however  <ARGM-DIS
,  
despite  
his  
ties  <ARGM-ADV
of  
clientelage  
with  
Washington  
and  
Tehran  
.  

He  >>ARG0
is  V01
no  
longer  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
dominant  
Shiite  
list  <ARG2
,  
the  
United  
Iraqi  
Alliance  
,  
and  
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
many  
seats  <ARG1
in  
the  
new  
parliament  
.  

Some  
2,000  
junior  
officers  >>>ARG1
of  
the  
old  
Baath  
army  
have  V01
been  V03
recalled  V03
to  
duty  <ARGM-GOL
in  
recent  
months  <ARGM-TMP
,  
something  >>ARG1
Chalabi  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
blocked  V01
if  
he  
could  
have  V01
.  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
Electoral  
Commission  >>>ARG0
is  V03
refusing  V01
to  
punish  V01
people  <ARG1
for  
mere  
past  
Baath  
Party  
membership  <ARG2

The  
situation  >>>ARG1
in  
Iraq  
is  V03
only  
going  V04
to  
get  V03
better  V02
this  
way  V01

If  
someone  >ARG0
committed  V02
a  
crime  <ARG1
against  
humanity  
,  
prosecute  V01
the  
person  <ARG1
.  

If  
he  
or  
she  
did  V01
not  
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
all  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
rights  V05
as  
other  
Iraqis  <ARG1

fighting  V01
still  >ARGM-TMP

several  
areas  <ARGM-LOC

mostly  
in  
Sadr  
city  <ARGM-LOC

Adhamiya

Baghdadis  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
venture  V01
much  <ARGM-ADV
out  
of  
their  
neighbourhoods  <ARGM-DIR

more  <ARGM-TMP

you  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
where  >>ARG2
you  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
get  V03
stuck  V01

There  
has  V01
been  V02
talk  V01
that  
the  
night  
curfew  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
implemented  V01
again  <ARGM-TMP

My  
neighbourhood  >>>ARG2

been  V03
surrounded  V01
by  
American  
troops  <ARG1
for  
three  
days  <ARGM-TMP
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
helicopters  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
circling  V01
over  
our  
heads  <ARGM-LOC
non-stop  <ARGM-TMP

Fedayeen  >>ARG1
are  V01
now  >ARGM-TMP
visible  V01
on  
the  
street  <ARGM-LOC
and  
they  >>>ARG0
have  V01
become  V01
bolder  V02
than  
ever  <ARGM-CXN
.  

Yesterday  >ARGM-TMP
there  
were  V02
tens  >>>ARG0
of  
them  
putting  V01
road  >ARG1
blocks  V01
on  
our  
street  <<ARG2
and  
setting  V03
up  
mortars  <ARG1
,  
they  >ARG1
only  >ARGM-ADV
come  V09
out  
in  
the  
open  <ARGM-LOC
when  >ARGM-TMP
Americans  >ARG0
leave  V11
the  
area  <ARG1
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
they  >>>ARG0
start  V01
firing  V01
mortars  <ARG1
indiscriminately  <ARGM-MNR
and  
shooting  V02
their  
AK  
-  
47's  <ARG2
in  
the  
air  <ARGM-DIR
.  

They  >>ARG0
are  V03
setting  V02
the  
road  >ARG1
blocks  V01
at  
the  
exact  
same  
positions  >ARG2
they  >ARG1
were  V01
during  
the  
war  V01
last  
year  <ARGM-TMP
,  
which  >ARG0
indicates  V01
they  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
same  
people  <ARG2
.  

And  
there  
is  V02
nothing  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
about  
it  <ARG2
really  <ARGM-ADV
,  
people  >>>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0

suggesting  V01
that  
we  >>ARG0

out

fight  V01
them  <ARG1

living  V01
in  
dream

Even  
the  
IP  >>ARG0
and  
ICDC  
have  V01
abandoned  V01
the  
neighbourhood  <ARG1
,  
and  
those  >ARG1
are  V01
trained  <ARG2
and  
armed  
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
expect  V01
scared  
civilians  >>>ARG0
to  
do  V02
anything  <ARG1
except  
to  
hide  V01
inside  <ARGM-LOC
and  
pray  V01
a  
helicopter  >>ARG0
or  
a  
tank  
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
bomb  V01
them  <ARG1
,  
and  
also  
how  >>>ARGM-MNR
are  V03
American  
soldiers  >>ARG0
going  V04
to  
distinguish  V01
the  
brave

valiant  
civilians  <ARG1
from  
the  
Fedayeen  <ARG2
?  

Everyone  >ARG1
is  V01
apprehensive  <ARG2
,  
there  
is  V02
some  
talk  V01
that  
April  >>>ARG1
9th  
and  
10th  
are  V03
going  V04
to  
be  V01
bloody  
days  <ARG2

Most  
people  >>ARG0
have  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
gone  V02
to  
work  V01
the  
last  
few  
days  <<ARGM-TMP

although  
it  
seems  V01
that  
the  
rest  >>ARG1

Baghdad  
is  V01
'  
normal  V02
'  
(  
if  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD

what  >ARG2

There  
are  V02
rumours  <ARG1
about  
preparations  V02
by  
slum  
dwellers  <ARG0
for  
another  
looting  >ARG1
spree  V01
against  
banks  <ARGM-GOL

governmental

public  
property  
similar  <ARGM-ADJ
to  
the  
one  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
took  V14
place  <ARG2
last  
April  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
already  >ARGM-TMP
overheard  V01
youngsters  >>ARG0
in  
my  
neighbourhood  
joking  V01
about  
it  <ARG2
and  
saying  V01
things  <ARG1
like  
"  
This  
time  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
the  
first  >ARG0
to  
loot  V01
,  
we  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
anything  <ARG1
the  
last  
time  <ARGM-TMP
"  
.  

Mosques  >>ARG0
are  V03
calling  V03
for  
donating  V01
blood  <ARG1
,  
food  
,  
and  
medicine  
for  
Fallujah  <ARG2
,  
and  
several  
convoys  >>ARG0
have  V01
already  >ARGM-TMP
headed  V02
out  <ARG1
for  
Fallujah  
,  
most  >ARG1
of  
them  
returned  V01
later  <ARGM-TMP
though  <ARGM-ADV
.  

What  >ARG0
irritates  V01
me  <ARG1
is  V01
this  
sudden  
false  
'  
solidarity  <ARG2
'  
between  
Sunni  
and  
Shi'ite  
clerics  
,  
we  >ARG0
all  
know  V01
that  
they  >>>ARG1

glad  V02
to  
get  V05
at  
each  
other  
s  
throats  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
have  V03
the  
chance  V02
,  
and  
Shia  
clerics  >>ARG0
were  V03
describing  V01
Fallujan  
insurgents  <ARG1

'  
Ba'athists

'

and  
'  
terrorists

just  
a  
few  
days

So  
what  >ARG1
happened  V01
?  

I  >ARG0
guess  V01
it  >ARG1

is  V01
that  
the

The

published  V01
an  
early  >ARGM-TMP

which  >>>R-ARG1

-  
in  
the  
post-accident  
period  
is  V03
characterized  V01
by  
persistent  
negative  
tendencies  <ARG0

the

it  <ARG1
even

that

that  >R-ARG0
just

General

was  V01
,  
he  >>>ARG0
seems  V01
to  
have  V01
confused  V01
coup  >ARG1
-  
making  V01
with  
"  
taking  V01
office  <ARG1

and  
moreover  >ARGM-ADV
went  V25
on  
to  
suggest  V01
that  
the

the

"  

Musharraf  >ARG0
made  V01
his  
coup  <ARG1
in  
part  <ARGM-ADV
because  
of  
the  
military  
's  
anger  <ARGM-CAU
over  
Prime  
Minister  
Nawaz

's  
willingness  
to  
back  V02
down  <ARGM-PRD
from  
confronting  V01
India  <ARG1
over  
Kashmir  <ARGM-CAU
,  
so  
that  
he  >ARG1
explicitly  >ARGM-ADV
came  V04
to  
power  <ARG2
as  
a  
warmonger  <ARGM-PRD
.  

I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tell  V01
you  <ARG2
how  
ominous  
I  >ARG0
found  V02
Bush  >ARG0
's  
performance  V02
in  
that  
interview  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
remember  V01
him  >>>ARG0
stuttering  V01
about  
"  
the  
General  <ARG1
,  
"  
unable  V01
to  
remember  V01
Musharraf  
's  
name  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
obviously  >ARGM-ADV
had  V03
no  
idea  <ARG1
what  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
was  V03
talking  V01
about  <C-ARG1
,  
though  
he  >ARG0
demonstrated  V01
a  
number  <ARG1
of  
ill  
-  
fated  
instincts  
.  

He  >>>ARG0
obviously  >ARGM-ADV
liked  V01
authoritarian  >ARGM-ADJ
rule  V03
better  <<ARGM-EXT
than  
democracy  
,  
equating  V01
dictatorship  <ARG1
with  
"  
stability  <ARG2
.  
"  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
he  >>ARG0
needed  V01
to  
know  V01
anything  <ARG1
about  
South  
Asia  
,  
with  
its  
nuclear  
giants  
and  
radical  
religious  
politics  
--  
the  
latter  
a  
dire  
security  
threat  <ARG1
to  
the  
US  
.  

He  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tell  V02
when  >>>ARGM-TMP
things  >>>ARG1
were  V03
becoming  V01
more  >ARGM-EXT
unstable  V02
as  <ARGM-ADV
opposed  V01
to  
less  <ARG1
.  

Musharraf  >>>ARG0
went  V15
on  
to  
play  V01
nuclear  
brinkmanship  <ARG1
with  
India  <ARG3
in  
2002  <ARGM-TMP
,  
risking  V01
war  V01
twice  <<ARGM-TMP
that  
year  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Although  
Musharraf  >>ARG0
did  V01
turn  V01
against  
the  
Taliban  <ARGM-DIR
after  
September  <ARGM-TMP
11  
,  
under  
extreme  
duress  <ARGM-CAU
from  
the  
US  
,  
elements  >>>ARG1
of  
his  
military  
continued  V01
to  
support  V01
radical  
Islamism  <ARG1
and  
have  V01
recently  >>ARGM-TMP
been  V03
implicated  V01
in  
assassination  >ARG1
attempts  V01
on  
Musharraf  <ARGM-GOL
himself  
.  

This  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
body  >>>ARG0
that  >>>R-ARG0
Bush  >ARG0
proclaimed  V01
was  V03
bringing  V01
"  
stability  <ARG1
"  
to  
the  
region  <ARG2
in  
fall  <ARGM-TMP
of  
1999  
.  

So  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
one  
answer  V01
to  
Bush  >ARG0
's  
charge  V05
about  
Edwards  <ARG1
is  V01
that  
if  
it  >ARG0
had  V03
any  
merit  <ARG1
,  
Bush  >>>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
declined  V02
to  
run  V02
himself  <ARGM-REC
.  

Another  
answer  V01
is  V01
that  
Edwards  >ARG0
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
knows  V01
far  
more  <ARG1
about  
foreign  
affairs  
now  <ARGM-TMP
than  
Bush  
did  V01
then  
.  

Indeed  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
given  
how  >>ARGM-ADV
Bush  >>>ARG0
has  V01
rampaged  V01
around  
the  
world  <ARG1
alienating  V01
allies  <ARG1
and  
ignoring  V01
vital  >ARGM-ADJ
conflicts  V01
with  
the  
potential  <<ARGM-ADV
to  
blow  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
on  
the  
US  <ARGM-GOL
,  
one  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
well  >ARGM-ADV
argue  V01
that  
Edwards  >ARG0
knows  V01
more  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
than  
Bush  
does  V01
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
what  >ARG1
Edwards  
'  
campaign  
literature  >ARG0
said  V01
about  
his  
positions  <ARG3
:  
"  
Edwards  >ARG0
believes  V01
that  
the  
U.S.  >>>ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
an  
active  
leader  <ARG2
to  
help  V01
resolve  V01
conflicts  V01
,  
from  
reducing  V01
tensions  V01
between  
India  <ARG1
and  
Pakistan  
to  
the  
peace  >ARG1
process  V02
in  
Northern  
Ireland  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Edwards  >>ARG0
is  V01
a  
strong  
supporter  <ARG2
of  
Israel  
,  
and  
believes  V01
that  
the  
U.S.  >ARG0
has  V03
a  
vital  
role  <ARG1
in  
promoting  V02
peace  V01
between  
the  
Israelis  <ARG1
and  
the  
Palestinians  
.  
"  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see  V01
Bush  >ARG0
doing  V02
any  <ARG1
of  
this  
.  

From

Daily  
Star

Friday

2004  

As  
the  
American  
public  >ARG0
gradually  >ARGM-TMP
wearies  V02
of  
the  
Iraq  
crisis  <ARG1
,  
some  >>>ARG0
have  V01
begun  V02
worrying  V02
that  
the  
war  V01
could  >ARGM-MOD
blow  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
on  
the  
US  <ARGM-GOL
by  
creating  V01
the  
conditions  <ARG1
for  
anti-American  
terrorism  
.  

Israel  >>>ARG0
,  
however  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
is  V01
much  >ARGM-EXT
closer  V10
to  
Iraq  <ARG2
and  
is  V01
likely  V01
to  
suffer  V01
from  
Iraqi  
instability  <ARG1
much  
more  <ARGM-EXT
acutely  
than  
will  
the  
United  
States  
.  

Ironically  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
among  
the  
strongest  
proponents  >>ARG2
of  
war  V01
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
were  V01
Israeli  
Prime  
Minister  <ARG1
Ariel  
Sharon  
and  
his  
neoconservative  
supporters  
in  
the  
US  
.  

Have  V01
they  >ARG0
,  
however  >ARGM-DIS
,  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
weakened  V01
Israeli  
security  <ARG1
?  

The  
biggest  
threat  >>ARG1
Israel  >ARG0
faces  V01
is  V01
not  
from  
conventional  
armies  <ARG2
but  
from  
the  
asymmetrical  
tactics  
of  
Palestinian  >>ARG0
national  >ARG1
liberation  V01
movements  V07
.  

The  
derailing  V01
of  
the  
Oslo  >ARG0
peace  >ARG1
process  V02
by  
the  
hard  
-  
line  
policies  <<ARG0
of  
Sharon  
and  
the  
Palestinian  
intifada  
has  V01
encouraged  V02
suicide  >ARGM-MNR
bombings  V01
.  

This  >>>ARG0
,  
in  
turn  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
has  V01
discouraged  V01
international  >ARG0
investment  V01
in  
Israel  <ARG2
and  
has  V01
made  V02
it  <ARG1
less  >ARGM-EXT
likely  V01
that  
immigrants  >ARG1
to  
the  
country  
will  >ARGM-MOD
actually  >ARGM-ADV
remain  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Although  
Israel  >ARG0
withdrew  V01
from  
Lebanese  
territory  <ARG2
in  
May  <ARGM-TMP
2000  
,  
the  
radical  
Lebanese  
Shiite  
party  >>>ARG1
,  
Hizbullah  
,  
has  V01
not  >>ARGM-NEG
been  V03
mollified  V01
.  

It  >>>ARG0
is  V03
estimated  V01
to  
have  V03
some  
5,000  
armed  
fighters  <ARG1
,  
and  
they  >>>ARG0
have  V01
pursued  V01
attacks  V01
against  
Israeli  
forces  <ARG1
to  
compel  V01
them  >ARG1
to  
withdraw  V01
from  
the  
Shebaa  
Farms  <ARG2
,  
a  
sliver  >ARG1
of  
Syrian  
territory  
that  >R-ARG1
Israel  >ARG0
annexed  V01
after  
the  
1967  >ARGM-TMP
war  V01
.  

Any  
thorough  >ARGM-EXT
assessment  V01
of  
the  
impact  V01
of  
the  
Iraq  >ARG1
war  V01
and  
its  
aftermath  
on  
Israel  
's  
security  
environment  
must  >ARGM-MOD
,  
therefore  >ARGM-ADV
,  
closely  >ARGM-ADV
examine  V01
its  >ARG0
likely  >ARGM-ADJ
effect  V01
on  
the  
conduct  V01
of  
asymmetrical  
warfare  <ARG1
.  

Although  
it  
is  V03
often  >ARGM-TMP
alleged  V01
(  
without  
much  
evidence  <ARGM-MNR
)  
that  
Saddam  >>ARG0
Hussein  
gave  V01
money  <ARG1
to  
the  
families  <ARG2
of  
Palestinian  
suicide  
bombers  
and  
so  >ARGM-ADV
encouraged  V02
asymmetrical  
warfare  <ARG1
,  
it  
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
clear  V06
that  
he  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
posed  V02
a  
danger  <ARG1
to  
Israel  
.  

The  
Palestinians  >>>ARG1
who  >>>R-ARG0
have  V01
been  V01
willing  V02
to  
kill  V01
themselves  <ARG1
to  
end  V01
the  
Israeli  >ARG0
occupation  V01
of  
the  
Gaza  
Strip  <ARG1
and  
the  
West  
Bank  
were  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
driven  V02
by  
economic  >ARG1
considerations  V02
.  

Saddam  >>ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
did  V02
anything  <ARG1
practical  
to  
help  V01
the  
Palestinians  <ARG2
.  

At  
some  
points  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
as  
in  
the  
late  
1980s  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
he  >>>ARG1
reportedly  >>ARGM-ADV
made  VLV
behind  
-  
the  
-  
scenes  >ARGM-LOC
overtures  V01
to  
the  
Israelis  <ARG2
to  
arrive  V01
at  
some  
sort  <ARG4
of  
a  
deal  V01
.  

He  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
allow  V01
Palestinian  
radicals  >ARG0
to  
launch  V01
operations  V01
against  
Israel  <ARGM-GOL
from  
Iraq  <<ARGM-DIR
.  

By  
the  
late  
1990s  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
Iraq  >>>ARG0
had  V03
no  
nuclear  
or  
biological  
weapons  
program  <ARG1
,  
and  
had  V01
destroyed  V01
its  
chemical  
weapons  
stockpiles  <ARG1
.  

Its  
ramshackle  
army  >>ARG1
had  V01
virtually  >ARGM-ADV
collapsed  V01
before  
the  
American  >ARG0
invasion  V01
in  
2003  <ARGM-TMP
.  

If  
it  
is  V01
hard  V02
to  
see  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
Baathist  
Iraq  >ARG0
posed  V02
any  
real  
threat  <ARG1
to  
Israel  
,  
it  
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
so  >ARGM-EXT
difficult  V01
to  
see  V01
a  
menace  <ARG1
in  
the  
current  
instability  <ARGM-ADV
.  

The  
bungling  V01
of  
post-war  
Iraq  <ARG1
by  
the  
Bush  >ARG0
administration  V01
created  V01
a  
weak  
and  
failed  
state  <ARG1
.  

Armed  
militias  >>>ARG0
,  
many  >ARG1
staffed  V01
by  
former  
Iraqi  
military  
men  <ARG2
with  
substantial  >>ARGM-EXT
training  V01
and  
experience  V01
,  
have  V01
proliferated  V01
.  

The  
US  >>ARG0
chose  V01
to  
ally  V01
itself  <ARG1
with  
such  
groups  <ARG2
as  
the  
Supreme  
Council  >>ARG2
for  
the  
Islamic  
Revolution  
in  
Iraq  
,  
whose  
15,000  
-  
strong  
Badr  
Corps  
paramilitary  >>R-ARG2
was  V03
trained  V01
by  
the  
Iranian  
Revolutionary  
Guards  <ARG0
.  

Anti-Israeli  >ARG1
and  
pro-Palestinian  
feeling  V01
is  V01
strong  V02
among  
several  
major  
Iraqi  
ideological  
groups  <ARGM-ADV
and  
currents  
.  

The  
more  
radical  
Shiites  >>>ARG0
,  
who  >R-ARG0
generally  >ARGM-ADV
follow  V02
the  
theocratic  
notions  <ARG1
of  
Iran  
's  
Ayatollah  
Ruhollah  
Khomeini  
,  
routinely  >>ARGM-TMP
chant  V01
and  
demonstrate  V01
against  
Israel  <ARGM-GOL
.  

They  >ARG0
vehemently  >ARGM-EXT
protested  V01
the  
Israeli  >ARG0
assassination  V01
of  
Sheikh  
Ahmed  <ARG1
Yassin  
,  
the  
leader  
of  
Hamas  
,  
last  
March  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Worse  V04
for  
Israel  <ARG2
,  
the  
assassination  V01
drew  V02
a  
denunciation  V01
even  
from  
the  
moderate  
and  
cautious  
Grand  >ARG0
Ayatollah  
Ali  
Sistani  
,  
who  >R-ARG0
wields  V01
enormous  
moral  
authority  <ARG1
over  
Iraqi  
Shiites  
.  

These  
Shiite  >ARG0
movements  V07
had  V01
been  V03
suppressed  V01
by  
Saddam  
Hussein  
's  
regime  <ARG0
,  
but  
have  V01
now  >>ARGM-TMP
organized  V01
and  
armed  V01
themselves  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
have  V01
also  >ARGM-ADV
reestablished  V01
their  
historical  
links  <ARG1
with  
Lebanese  
and  
Iranian  
Shiites  
.  

It  
is  V01
inevitable  V01
that  
most  
Iraqi  
Shiites  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
side  V01
with  
their  
Hizbullah  
coreligionists  <ARG1
against  
Israel  <ARGM-GOL
,  
and  
it  >>ARG1
seems  V01
likely  V01
that  
Iraqi  
Shiites  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
get  V03
rich  V01
enough  <ARGM-CXN
from  
Iraqi  >ARG0
petroleum  >ARG1
sales  V01
in  
the  
future  <<ARGM-TMP
that  
they  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
in  
a  
good  
position  >ARGM-LOC
to  
bankroll  V01
Lebanese  
Shiite  
radicals  <ARG1
.  

Sunni  
Arab  
fundamentalists  >ARG0
deeply  >ARGM-MNR
sympathize  V01
with  
the  
Palestinians  <ARG1
and  
with  
Hamas  
,  
and  
those  >ARG0
in  
Iraq  
have  V03
deep  V02
historical  
inks  <ARG1
with  
fundamentalists  
in  
Jordan  
and  
Palestine  
.  

Iraqi  
cities  >>ARG1
such  
as  
Fallujah  
and  
Ramadi  
were  V01
on  
the  
truck  
route  <ARG2
from  
Amman  
to  
Baghdad  
,  
and  
so  >ARGM-ADV
came  V04
under  
the  
influence  V01
of  
the  
Salafi  >ARG0
movement  V07
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
popular  V02
in  
Jordan  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Secular  
Arab

into

in  
the  
island  
nation  >ARG0
's  
two  
decades  
-  
old  >ARGM-TMP
civil  >ARGM-ADJ
war  V01
that  >>>R-ARG0
has  V01
seen  V01
violent  
strife  <ARG1
between  
ethnic  
Tamils  
and  
the  
Sinhalese  
majority  
-  
leaving  V13
over  
60,000  <ARG1
dead  <ARG1
on  
both  
sides  V01
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
that  >ARG0
explains  V01
the  
delay  V01
in  
the  
signing  <ARG1
of  
a  
formal  >ARGM-ADJ
defense  >ARG1
agreement  V01
that  >R-ARG1

four

According  
to  
Professor  >>>ARGM-ADV

D  
Muni  
,  
South  
Asia  
expert  
at  
the  
Jawaharal  
Nehru  
University  
,  
the  
two

year  >ARGM-TMP
peace  >ARG1
talks  V01
between  
Colombo  <ARG0
and  
the  
Liberation  
Tigers  
of  
Tamil  
Eelam  
(  
LTTE  
)  
are  V03
stalemated  V01
.  

For  
that  
reason  >>>ARGM-CAU
,  >ARG1-DSP
he  >ARG0
said  V01
,  <C-ARG1-DSP
Kumaratunga  
's  
government  >>>ARG0
was  V01
keen  V02
to  
beef  V01
up  
military  
preparedness  <ARG1
with  
Indian  >ARG0
support  V01
.  

"  
The  
Sri  
Lankan  
government  >>>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
initiate  V01
a  
conflict  V01
but  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
interested  V01
in  
deterring  V01
the  
LTTE  <ARG1
from  
starting  V01
one  <ARG1
.  

And  >>>ARGM-DIS
the  
Tigers  >ARG0
look  V02
as  
if  
they  >>ARG0
are  V01
on  
the  
brink  <ARG2
of  
launching  V01
another  
offensive  <ARG1
,  
"  
Muni  >ARG0
told  V01
IPS  <ARG2
.  

Colombo  >ARG0
held  V04
six  
rounds  V05
of  
talks  V01
with  
the  
Tigers  <ARG2
between  
September  <<<ARGM-TMP
2002  
and  
March  
2003  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
last  
April  >ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
rebels  >>>ARG0
abruptly  >ARGM-MNR
pulled  V02
out  
of  
negotiations  V01
demanding  V01
recognition  V01
,  
first  <ARGM-TMP
,  
for  
the  
right  V05
to  
self  >ARG1
-  
rule  V03
before  
proceeding  V01
any  
further  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Kumaratunga  >ARG0
's  
India  >ARG1
tour  V01
preceded  V01
a  
three

day  >ARGM-TMP
visit  V01
to  
Sri

by  
Norwegian  
Foreign  
Minister  <ARG0
Jan  
Petersen  
in  
a  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
bid  V01
to  
revive  V01
the  
peace  >ARG1
talks  V01
that  >>>R-ARG1
were  V03
supposed  V02
to  
follow  V01
a  
ceasefire  V01
that  >R-ARG1
Oslo  >ARG0
successfully  >ARGM-ADV
brokered  V01
in  
February  <ARGM-TMP
2002  
.  

Petersen  >>ARG0
held  VLV
discussions  V01
with  
both  
Kumaratunga  <ARG2
and  
the  
reclusive  
LTTE  
leader  
Velupillai  
Prabhakaran  
in  
the  
rebel  
stronghold  <ARGM-LOC

at  
the

Saturday  <<ARGM-TMP

too  >ARGM-DIS
,  
failed  V01
.  

Colombo  >>ARG1
,  
too  >ARGM-DIS
,  
seems  V01
to  
be  V01
in  
an  
intractable  
position  <ARG2
.  

According  
to  
former  
Indian  
army  
general  
A  
S  
Kalkat  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
difficulty  >ARG1
for  
Kumaratunga  
's  
government  
lay  V01
in  
the  
fact  <ARG2
that  
the  
LTTE  >>>ARG0
had  V01
become  V01
a  
de  
jure  
power  <ARG2
in  
the  
north  
and  
east  
of  
the  
island

was  V03
running  V01
every  
aspect  <ARG1

administration  V01
in  
the  
areas  <ARGM-LOC

its  >ARG0

which  >R-ARG0

provided  V01
for  
the  
disarming  V01
of  
the  
formidable  
LTTE  <ARG1
-  
Kalkat  >ARG0
said  V01
the  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
defense  >ARG2
deal  V01
would  >ARGM-MOD
essentially  >ARGM-ADV
be  V01
a  
reiteration  V01
of  
the  
older  
one  <ARG1
minus  
its  >ARG1
military  >ARG2
commitment  V01
.  

Kalkat  >>>ARG0
,  
who  >R-ARG0
currently  >ARGM-TMP
chairs  V01
the  
independent  
US  >ARGM-LOC
-  
based  V01
International  
Council  <ARG1
on  
Conflict  
Resolution  
,  
said  V01
despite  
the  
failure  >>>ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
Indian  
army  
to  
disarm  V01
or  
even  >ARGM-ADV
subdue  V01
the  
Tigers  <ARG1
,  
India  >ARG1
remained  V01
the  
only  
power  <ARG3
capable  
of  
influencing  V01
the  
course  <ARG1
of  
the  
current  >ARGM-TMP
peace  >ARG1
talks  V01
.  

"  
The  
Norwegians  >ARG0
mean  V02
well  <ARG1
but  
their  
role  >>ARG1
is  V01
limited  V01
to  
that  <ARG2
of  
honest  
broker  
and  
the  
LTTE  >>ARG0
is  V01
keenly  >ARGM-EXT
aware  V01
that  
they  >>>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
the  
power  <ARG1
[  
unlike  
India  <ARGM-ADV
]  
to  
underwrite  V01
any  
arrangement  V01
,  
"  
Kalkat  >ARG0
told  V01
IPS  <ARG2
in  
an  
interview  V01
.  

In  
1987  >ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
Tamil  
Tigers  >ARG0
reluctantly  >ARGM-MNR
accepted  V01
the  
peace  
accord  <ARG1
under  
Indian  
pressure  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Under  
the  
accord  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
a  
new  
northeastern  
provincial  
council  >>ARG1
was  V03
formed  V01
and  
the  
Indian  
army  >>ARG1
was  V03
deployed  V01
as  
peacekeepers  <ARGM-PRD
in  
the  
north  <ARG2
and  
east  
.  

However  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
differences  V02
between  
India  <ARG1
and  
LTTE  
soon  >>ARGM-TMP
surfaced  V01
and  
led  V03
to  
clashes  V01
between  
Tiger  
guerrillas  <ARG0
and  
the  
Indian  
peace  >ARG1
keeping  V01
force  
.  

About  
1,200  
Indian  
soldiers  >>ARG1
were  V03
killed  V01
during  
this  
phase  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
conflict  V01
.  

India  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
pull  V01
back  <ARG2
its  
forces  <ARG1
from  
Sri  
Lanka  <ARGM-DIR
in  
1989  <ARGM-TMP

Two

Pakistani

by  
the

this  >ARG1

an

that

the  
enemy  >ARG1

understand  V01
the  
only  >ARGM-ADJ

the

what  >ARG1

reason  >ARG1

Since

talked  V01

Ok

We  >ARG0
all

that

As

this

called

has  V01
anyone  >ARG0

that  
perhaps  >ARGM-ADV
George  >>ARG0

just  >ARGM-ADV
wanted  V01
to  
fly  V01
jets  <ARG1

let  V01
's  >ARG0
remember  V01

flying  V01

did  V01
you  >ARG0

that

News  >ARGM-ADJ
coverage  V03
of  
the  
president  
’s  
years  <ARG1
in  
the  
Guard  
has  V01
tended  V02
to  
focus  V01
on  
one  
brief  
portion  <ARG2
of  
that  
time  
—  
to  
the  
exclusion  V01
of  
virtually  
everything  <ARG1
else  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
just  
for  
the  
record  >ARGM-PRP
,  
here  >ARG2
,  
in  
full  >ARGM-ADV
,  
is  V01
what  >ARG1
Bush  >ARG0
did  V02
:  

The  
future  
president  >ARG0
joined  V04
the  
Guard  <ARG1
in  
May  <ARGM-TMP
1968  
.  

Almost  
immediately  >ARGM-TMP
,  
he  >ARG0
began  V01
an  
extended  
period  <ARG1
of  
training  V01
.  

Six  
weeks  
of  
basic  >ARGM-ADJ
training  V01
.  

Fifty  
-  
three  
weeks  
of  
flight  >ARG1
training  V01
.  

Twenty  
-  
one  
weeks  
of  
fighter  
-  
interceptor  >ARG1
training  V01
.  

That  >ARG1
was  V01
80  
weeks  >ARG2
to  
begin  V01
with  <C-ARG2
,  
and  
there  
were  V02
other  
training  
periods  >ARG1
thrown  V02
in  
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
full  
-  
time  >ARGM-TMP
work  V01
.  

By  
the  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
was  V01
over  <ARG2
,  
Bush  >>ARG0
had  V01
served  V01
nearly  
two  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Not  
two  
years  
of  
weekends  
.  

Two  
years  
.  

After  
training  V01
,  
Bush  >>>ARG0
kept  V02
flying  V01
,  
racking  V01
up  
hundreds  <ARG1
of  
hours  
in  
F  
-  
102  
jets  
.  

As  
he  
did  V01
,  
he  >ARG0
accumulated  V01
points  <ARG1
toward  
his  >>ARG2
National  
Guard  >ARG1
service  V01
requirements  V01
.  

At  
the  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
guardsmen  >>>ARG0
were  V03
required  V01
to  
accumulate  V01
a  
minimum  <ARG1
of  
50  
points  
to  
meet  V01
their  >ARG1
yearly  >ARGM-TMP
obligation  V01
.  

According  
to  
records  >>ARGM-ADV
released  V01
earlier  <ARGM-TMP
this  
year  <ARGM-TMP
,  
Bush  >ARG0
earned  V01
253  
points  <ARG1
in  
his  
first  
year  <ARGM-TMP
,  
May  <ARGM-TMP
1968  
to  
May  
1969  
(  
since  
he  >ARG0
joined  V04
in  
May  <ARGM-TMP
1968  
,  
his  >ARG0
service  V01
thereafter  >>ARGM-TMP
was  V03
measured  V01
on  
a  
May  
-  
to  
-  
May  
basis  <ARGM-MNR
)  
.  

Bush  >ARG0
earned  V01
340  
points  <ARG1
in  
1969  <ARGM-TMP
-  
1970  
.  

[  
In  
other  
words  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Bush  >ARG0
earned  V01
enough  
points  <ARG1
to  
satisfy  V01
the  
requirements  V01
for  
his  
entire  
six  
year  
hitch  <ARG0
in  
1969  <<<ARGM-TMP
-  
1970  
alone  
.

acd  
]  

He  >ARG0
earned  V01
137  
points  <ARG1
in  
1970  <ARGM-TMP
-  
1971  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
he  >ARG0
earned  V01
112  
points  <ARG1
in  
1971  <ARGM-TMP
-  
1972  
.  

The  
numbers  >ARG0
indicate  V01
that  
in  
his  
first  
four  
years  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Bush  >ARG1
not  
only  >ARGM-ADV
showed  V02
up  
,  
he  >ARG1
showed  V02
up  
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Did  V01
you  >ARG0
know  V01
that  <ARG1
?  

That  >ARG0
brings  V01
the  
story  <ARG1
to  
May  >>>ARGM-TMP
1972  
—  
the  
time  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
has  V01
been  V01
the  
focus  <ARG2
of  
so  
many  >ARGM-ADJ
news  >ARG1
reports  V01
—  
when  >>R-ARGM-TMP
Bush  >>ARG1
“  
deserted  V01
”  
(  
according  
to  
anti-Bush  
filmmaker  
Michael  <ARGM-ADV
Moore  
)  
or  
went  V08
“  
AWOL  <ARG2
”  
(  
according  
to  
Terry  <ARGM-ADV
McAuliffe  
,  
chairman  
of  
the  
Democratic  
National  
Committee  
)  
.  

Bush  >ARG0
asked  V02
for  
permission  V01
to  
go  V02
to  
Alabama  <ARG4
to  
work  V01
on  
a  
Senate  >ARG1
campaign  V01
.  

His  
superior  
officers  >ARG0
said  V01
OK  <ARG1
.  

Requests  V01
like  
that  <ARGM-ADJ
were  V01
n’t  >ARGM-NEG
unusual  V01
,  
says  V01
retired  
Col.  >ARG0
William  
Campenni  
,  
who  >R-ARG0
flew  V01
with  
Bush  <ARGM-COM
in  
1970  <ARGM-TMP
and  
1971  
.  

“  
In  
1972  >ARGM-TMP
,  
there  
was  V02
an  
enormous  
glut  <ARG1
of  
pilots  
,  
”  
Campenni  >ARG0
says  V01
.  

“  
The  
Vietnam  
War  >>ARG1
was  V03
winding  V04
down  
,  
and  
the  
Air  
Force  >>ARG0
was  V03
putting  V01
pilots  <ARG1
in  
desk  
jobs  <ARG2
.  

In  
’72  
or  
’73  
,  
if  
you  >ARG1
were  V01
a  
pilot  <ARG2
,  
active  
or  
Guard  
,  
and  
you  >>>ARG1
had  VLV
an  
obligation  V01
and  
wanted  V01
to  
get  V05
out  <ARG2
,  
no  
problem  
.  

In  
fact  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >>ARG0
were  V03
helping  V01
them  >ARG0
solve  V01
their  
problem  <ARG1
.  
”  

So  >ARGM-DIS
Bush  >>ARG0
stopped  V01
flying  V01
.  

From  
May  >ARGM-TMP
1972  
to  
May  
1973  
,  
he  >ARG0
earned  V01
just  
56  
points  <ARG1
—  
not  
much  
,  
but  
enough  
to  
meet  V01
his  >ARG2
requirement  V01
.  

Then  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
in  
1973  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
as  
Bush  >>ARG0
made  VLV
plans  V01
to  
leave  V15
the  
Guard  <ARG1
and  
go  V02
to  
Harvard  
Business  
School  <ARG4
,  
he  >>ARG1
again  >ARGM-TMP
started  V01
showing  V02
up  
frequently  <ARGM-TMP
.  

In  
June  >ARGM-TMP
and  
July  
of  
1973  
,  
he  >ARG0
accumulated  V01
56  
points  <ARG1
,  
enough  
to  
meet  V01
the  
minimum  >ARGM-ADJ
requirement  V01
for  
the  
1973  
-  
1974  
year  <ARG0
.  

Then  
,  
at  
his  >ARG0
request  V01
,  
he  
was  V03
given  VLV
permission  V01
to  
go  V02
.  

Bush  >>>ARG0
received  V01
an  
honorable  >ARGM-MNR
discharge  V01
after  
serving  V01
five  
years  <ARGM-TMP
,  
four  
months  
and  
five  
days  
of  
his  >ARG0
original  >ARGM-ADJ
six  
-  
year  >ARGM-TMP
commitment  V01
.  

By  
that  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
however  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >>ARG0
had  V01
accumulated  V01
enough  
points  <ARG1
in  
each  
year  <ARGM-TMP
to  
cover  V01
six  
years  <ARG1
of  
service  V01
.  

During  
his  >ARG0
service  V01
,  
Bush  >ARG0
received  V01
high  >ARGM-ADJ
marks  V02
as  
a  
pilot  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

A  
1970  >ARGM-TMP
evaluation  V01
said  V01
Bush  >>ARG1
“  
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
stands  V06
out  
as  
a  
top  
notch  
fighter  
interceptor  
pilot  <ARGM-PRD
”  
and  
was  V01
“  
a  
natural  
leader  >ARG1
whom  >R-ARG1
his  
contemporaries  >ARG0
look  V01
to  <C-ARG1
for  
leadership  V02
.  
”  

A  
1971  >ARGM-TMP
evaluation  V01
called  V01
Bush  <ARG1
“  
an  
exceptionally  
fine  
young  
officer  >>>ARG0
and  
pilot  
”  
who  >>>R-ARG0
“  
continually  >ARGM-TMP
flies  V01
intercept  >ARG1
missions  V01
with  
the  
unit  <<ARGM-COM
to  
increase  V01
his  
proficiency  <ARG1
even  
further  <ARG2
.  
”  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
a  
1972  >ARGM-TMP
evaluation  V01
called  V01
Bush  <ARG1
“  
an  
exceptional  
fighter  
interceptor  
pilot  <ARG2
and  
officer  
.  
”  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
it  
is  V01
only  >ARGM-ADV
natural  V02
that  
news  >ARG1
reports  V01
questioning  V03
Bush  >ARG0
’s  
service  V01
—  
in  
The  
Boston  
Globe  <<<ARGM-LOC
and  
The  
New  
York  
Times  
,  
on  
CBS  
and  
in  
other  
outlets  
—  
would  >ARGM-MOD
come  V09
out  
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Democrats  >>ARG1
are  V01
spitting  >ARGM-EXT
mad  V04
over  
attacks  V01
on  
John

’s  
record  <ARG1
by  
the  
group  <ARG0
Swift

And  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
as  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
with  
Kerry  <ARGM-MNR
,  
it  
’s  V01

look  V01

’s  
entire

including  
his  >>ARG0

it  >>ARG1

not

blames  V01

that  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
doing  V02
it  <ARG1
entirely  
for  
their  
own  
reasons  <ARGM-PRP
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
it  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
noted  V01
in  
passing  V21
that  
Kerry  >>ARG0
has  V01
personally  >ARGM-MNR
questioned  V03
Bush  >ARG0
’s  
service  V01
,  
while  
Bush  >>ARG0
has  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
personally  >ARGM-MNR
questioned  V03
Kerry  <ARG1
’s  
.  

In  
April  >>>ARGM-TMP
—  
before  
the  
Swift  
boat  
veterans  >>ARG0
had  V01
said  V01
a  
word  <ARG1
—  
Kerry  >ARG0
said  V01
Bush  >>>ARG0
“  
has  V11
yet  <ARG1
to  
explain  V01
to  
America  <ARG2
whether  <ARG1
or  
not  
,  
and  
tell  V01
the  
truth  <ARG1
,  
about  
whether  
he  >ARG1
showed  V02
up  
for  
duty  <ARGM-PRP
.  
”  

Earlier  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Kerry  >ARG0
said  V01
,  
“  
Just  
because  
you  >ARG0
get  V01
an  
honorable  >ARGM-MNR
discharge  V01
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
,  
in  
fact  >ARGM-ADV
,  
answer  V01
that  
question  V01
.  
”  

Now  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
after  
the  
Swift  
boat  
episode  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
spotlight  V01
has  V01
returned  V02
to  
Bush  <ARG2
.  

That  >>ARG1
’s  V01
fine  V04
.  

We  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
know  V01
as  
much  <ARG1
as  
we  
can  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
perhaps  >ARGM-ADV
someday  >ARGM-TMP
Kerry  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
release  V01
more  <ARG1
of  
his  
military  
records  
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

Byron  >ARG1
York  
is  V01
a  
White  
House  
correspondent  <ARG2
for  
National  
Review  
.  

His  
column  >ARG1
appears  V01
in  
The  
Hill  <ARGM-LOC
each  
week  <ARGM-TMP
.  

One  
week  
to  
elections  
day  
and  
the  
general  
atmosphere  >>ARG2
in  
the  
capital  
is  V01
eerie  <ARG2
,  
yet  
strikingly  >ARGM-EXT
familiar  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
suspect  V01
the  
streets  >ARG0
of  
Baghdad  
will  >ARGM-MOD
look  V02
as  
if  
a  
war  V01
is  V03
looming  V01
this  
week  <<<ARGM-TMP
.  

There  
is  V02
no  >ARGM-NEG
doubt  V01
that  
many  
Iraqis  >ARG0
regard  V01
the  
date  <ARG1
of  
30  
January  
as  
a  
day  <ARG2
of  
renewed  >ARGM-ADV
hope  V01
,  
one  >>>ARG2
they  >>>ARG1
have  V01
been  V03
awaiting  V01
all  
their  
lives  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
at  
the  
same  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
many  
others  >>ARG0
are  V03
already  >ARGM-TMP
dreading  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

The  
interim  
government  >>ARG0
has  V01
promised  V01
security  >ARG1
measures  V02
that  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
reduce  V01
the  
violence  <ARG1
on  
the  
day  <ARGM-TMP
of  
elections  V01
,  
but  
I  >>ARG0
fail  V01
to  
see  V01
how  >>ARGM-MNR
they  >>>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
protect  V01
all  
5,000  
(  
or  
so  
)  
balloting  
centres  <ARG1
.  

Many  
voting  
centres  >>>ARG1
have  V01
already  >>>ARGM-TMP
been  V03
successfully  >>ARGM-ADV
attacked  V01
or  
destroyed  V01
in  
many  
areas  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Now  >>>ARGM-ADV
that  
the  
picture  >>ARG1
is  V01
clear  V06
,  
the  
two  
main  
competing  
lists  >>ARG1
seem  V01
to  
be  V01
the  
United  
Iraqi  
Coalition  
list  <ARG2
and  
Allawi  
's  
Al  
-  
Iraqiya  
list  
.  

Ayad  >>>ARG0
Allawi  
,  
and  
other  
ministers  >ARG0
running  V02
on  
his  
list  <ARGM-LOC
,  
have  V01
quite  
expectedly  >ARGM-ADV
used  V01
their  
governmental  
positions  <ARG1
in  
campaigning  V01
.  

One  
minister  >ARG0
reportedly  >ARGM-ADV
handed  V03
out  
100  
dollar  
'  
gifts  <ARG1
'  
to  
journalists  >ARG0
attending  V01
a  
press  >ARG0
conference  V01
for  
Allawi  <ARG1
,  
a  
practice  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
brings  V01
back  <ARG3
bad  
memories  <ARG1
to  
many  
Iraqis  <ARG2
.  

Sheikh  
Naji  >ARG0
Al  
-  
Abbudi  
,  
a  
spokesman  
for  
Sistani  
,  
affirmed  V01
the  
claims  V01
that  
the  
Grand  
Ayatollah  >>ARG0
is  V03
backing  V01
the  
United  
Iraqi  
Coalition  
list  <ARG1
.  

Indeed  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
Sistani  
's  
agents  >>>ARG0
all  
over  
the  
country  
have  V01
been  V01
quite  >ARGM-EXT
active  V06
in  
educating  V01
Iraqi  
Shia  <ARG1
on  
the  
merits  <ARG2
of  
elections  V01
,  
which  >>ARG0
has  V01
led  V03
to  
the  
assassination  V01
of  
at  
least  
two  <ARG1
of  
them  
.  

Al  >ARG0
-  
Abbudi  
stated  V01
that  
"  
His  
Emminence  >>ARG0
"  
decided  V01
to  
openly  >ARGM-MNR
support  V01
the  
list  <ARG1
because  
"  
others  >>>ARG0
"  
(  
obviously  
a  
reference  V01
to  
Allawi  <ARG1
)  
have  V01
been  V03
abusing  V02
official  
state  
positions  <ARG1
and  
media  
outlets  
in  
their  >ARG0
campaigning  V01
.  

Again  >ARGM-DIS
there  
is  V02
no  >ARGM-NEG
official  >ARGM-ADJ
written  >ARGM-PRD
statement  V01
from  
Sistani  
's  
office  <ARG0
confirming  V01
this  
allegation  V01
,  
which  >>>R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
think  V01
is  V01
intentional  V01
.  

Ahmed  >>>ARG0
Al  
-  
Chalabi  
and  
defense  
minister  
Hazim  
Al  
-  
Sha'lan  
have  V01
been  V03
engaging  V01
in  
shrill  >ARGM-ADJ
public  >ARG1
attacks  V01
over  
the  
media  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

Chalabi  >ARG0
describing  V01
Sha'lan  <ARG1
as  
a  
"  
Ba'athist  <ARG2
"  
and  
a  
"  
former  
double  
agent  
for  
Saddam  
and  
the  
CIA  
"  
,  
while  
Sha'lan  >ARG0
dismisses  V02
Chalabi  <ARG1
as  
a  
"  
thief  <ARG2
"  
and  
an  
"  
Iranian  
stooge  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
longs  V02
for  
his  >ARG1
own  >ARGM-ADJ
origins  V01
by  
defending  V01
Iran  <ARG1
"  
.  

One  
remark  V01
made  VLV
by  
Sha'lan  
on  
Al  
-  
Arabiya  
TV  
,  
that  
he  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
say  V01
more  <ARG1
about  
Chalabi  
because  
he  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
embarrass  V01
himself  <ARG1
and  
the  
viewers  
almost  >>ARGM-ADV
made  V02
me  >ARG1
roll  V01
on  
the  
floor  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
an  
extremely  
amusing  
episode  <ARG2
,  
watching  V01
Chalabi  >>ARG1
looking  V02
smug  <ARG1
and  
amused  
,  
contrasted  V01
with  
Sha'lan  >ARG0
,  
all  
serious  
and  
barely  >ARGM-EXT
keeping  V04
himself  <ARG1
from  
swearing  V02
.  

Fistfights  
,  
please  
.  

Hazim  >>>ARG0
Al  
-  
Sha'lan  
,  
by  
the  
way  V01
,  
is  V01
the  
son  <ARG2
of  
the  
late  
Sheikh  
of  
Al  
-  
Khaza'il  
in  
Diwaniya  
and  
has  V03
the  
potential  <ARG1
to  
replace  V01
former  
information  
minister  
,  
M.S.  <ARG1
Al  
-  
Sahaf  
,  
in  
his  >ARG0
nonsensical  >ARGM-ADJ
media  >ARGM-ADJ
statements  V01
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
passed  V06
as  
jokes  V01
.  

The  
main  
Kurdish  
coalition  
list  >>ARG1
(  
PUK  
and  
KDP  
)  
is  V03
barely  >ARGM-EXT
mentioned  V01
outside  
the  
Kurdish  
region  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Even  
there  >>ARGM-LOC
,  
many  
Kurds  >>ARG0
look  V02
and  
act  V01
as  
if  
they  >>>ARG0
are  V03
going  V04
to  
grab  V01
the  
chance  V02
to  
vote  V01
them  <ARG1
out  
of  
power  <ARGM-PRD
.  

I  >ARG0
doubt  V01
that  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
the  
outcome  <ARG2
though  <<ARGM-DIS
.  

Many  
Iraqis  >>ARG0
,  
including  
conservative  
and  
religious  
Iraqis  
,  
are  V03
surprisingly  >ARGM-ADV
rooting  V03
for  
the  
Iraqi  
Communist  
party  <ARG1
,  
probably  
in  
an  
attempt  V01
to  
counter  V01
the  
influence  V01
of  
Islamists  <ARG0
in  
the  
forthcoming  
National  
Assembly  <ARG1
.  

The  
Communist  
party  >>>ARG1
has  V03
the  
largest  
number  <ARG1
of  
registered  
party  
members  
in  
the  
country  
and  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
considered  V01
as  
the  
oldest  
popular  
political  
party  <ARGM-PRD
in  
Iraq  
.  

Its  
support  
base  >>ARG1
is  V01
much  >ARGM-CXN
larger  V01
than  
what  
it  
seems  V01
.  

***  

Several  
candidates  >>>ARG1
were  V03
assassinated  V01
and  
targeted  V01
these  
last  
two  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
,  
others  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
forced  V01
under  
threats  <ARGM-MNR
to  
withdraw  V01
and  
to  
follow  V02
the  
example  <ARG1
of  
the  
Islamic  
party  
.  

Sectarian  >ARG1
tensions  V01
are  V01
at  
their  
highest  <ARG2
since  
April  <ARGM-TMP
,  
2004  
,  
with  
Sunni  
insurgents  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
openly  >ARGM-MNR
attacking  V01
Husseiniyas  <ARG1
and  
Shia  
mosques  
.  

I  >>ARG0
had  VLV
an  
interesting  >ARGM-ADJ
conversation  V01
with  
a  
middle  
-  
aged  
taxi  
driver  >>>ARG1
who  >>>R-ARG1
used  V03
to  
live  V01
in  
Fallujah  <ARGM-LOC
and  
is  V01
now  <ARGM-TMP
at  
relatives  <ARG2
in  
Amiriya  <ARGM-LOC
,  
Baghdad  
.  

After  
asking  V01
me  <ARG2
which  
tribe  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
belong  V01
to  <C-ARG1
(  
thus  >ARGM-ADV
assessing  V01
my  
sectarian  
background  <ARG1
)  
he  >>>ARG0
started  V01
hurling  V01
abuses  V01
at  
the  
Shia  <<ARG2
,  
calling  V01
them  <ARG1
Persians  <ARG2
,  
Majoos  
(  
fire  
worshippers  
)  
,  
rabid  
dogs  
and  
a  
handful  
of  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
descriptions  V01
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
mention  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

He  >ARG0
described  V01
Allawi  
's  
face  <ARG1
as  
that  <ARG2
of  
a  
f*ed  
horse  
and  
he  >ARG0
dismissed  V02
the  
whole  
government  <ARG1
as  
a  
band  <ARG2
of  
thieves  
and  
traitors  
.  

I  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
argue  V02
with  
him  <ARG1
but  
I  >ARG0
asked  V01
him  <ARG2
what  >>ARG1
he  >ARG0
believed  V01
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
viable  >ARGM-ADJ
solution  V01
to  
this  
mess  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
said  V01
that  
resistance  V01
was  V01
the  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
commonsense  >ARGM-ADJ
solution  V01
.  

First  >ARGM-TMP
driving  V02
out  <ARG2
the  
Americans  <ARG1
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
fighting  V01
the  
Shia  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-GOL
into  
submission  V01
(  
as  
in  
1991  <<ARGM-MNR
)  
.  

Sunni  
Iraqis  >ARG0
contend  V01
that  
elections  V01
are  V01
impossible  V01
to  
hold  V04
under  
occupation  V01
.  

Leaving  V12
aside  <ARG2
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
this  
views  V02
conflicts  V01
with  
other  
historical  
examples  <ARG1
in  
the  
region  
,  
Sunnis  >>ARG0
have  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
offered  V01
an  
alternative  >ARGM-ADJ
choice  V01
,  
which  >ARG0
eventually  >ARGM-TMP
leads  V02
one  >ARG0
to  
guess  V01
that  
the  
opinion  >>ARG1
held  V02
by  
the  
Fallujan  
taxi  
driver  <ARG0
above  
is  V01
precisely  
what  >>>ARG1
they  >>>ARG0
are  V03
planning  V01
to  
implement  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
had  VLV
another  
conversation  V01
some  
months  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
with  
a  
retired  
Ba'athist  
old  
-  
timer  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
claimed  V01
that  
Ba'athists  >ARG0
have  V03
the  
means  >>ARGM-MNR
to  
stage  V01
a  
third  
coup  
d'etat  <ARG1
and  
return  V01
to  
power  <ARG4
within  
10  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
of  
an  
American  >ARG1
withdrawal  V01
.  

On  
sensing  V01
my  
incredulity  <ARG1
to  
his  >ARG0
statement  V01
he  >ARG0
asserted  V02
that  
Ba'athist  
cells  >ARG1
exist  V01
in  
all  
parts  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
country  
and  
that  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
have  V03
a  
central  
command  <ARG1
,  
even  
though  
many  >>ARG0
have  V01
formed  V01
seperate  
cells  <ARG1
(  
often  
under  
Islamic  
labels  
)  
with  
their  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-ADJ
leaderships  V02
.  

He  >ARG0
said  V01
that  
they  >ARG0
have  V03
the  
training  V01
and  
the  
funding  V01
as  
well  
as  
the  
support  V01
of  
neighbouring  V01
and  
regional  
governments  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
concur  V01
that  
Ba'athists  >>ARG1
and  
former  
security  
forces  
are  V01
capable  V01
of  
immediately  >ARGM-TMP
controlling  V01
at  
least  
5  <ARG1
out  
of  
18  
governorates  
,  
along  
with  
the  
capital  
,  
if  
Americans  >>>ARG1
are  V01
to  
be  V03
removed  V01
from  
the  
picture  <ARG2
entirely  <ARGM-EXT
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
see  V01
that  <ARG1
as  
a  
fatal  >ARGM-ADJ
misconception  V01
,  
which  >>>R-ARG0
is  V03
doing  VLV
Sunnis  >ARG1
harm  V01
,  
because  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
believe  V01
the  
US  >>ARG0
is  V03
going  V02
anywhere  <ARG4
so  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Any  
government  >>>ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
assumes  V01
power  <ARG1
after  
the  
elections  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
realises  V01
this  <ARG1
,  
so  
not  
even  
Sistani  >>>ARG0
is  V03
going  V04
to  
call  V03
the  
US  >ARG0
to  
withdraw  V01
its  
troops  <ARG1
,  
despite  
what  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
is  V03
saying  V01
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
not  
until  
they  >>ARG2
are  V03
ensured  V01
the  
insurgency  >ARG1
is  V01
out  
of  
the  
picture  <ARG2
,  
or  
that  
they  >ARG0
have  V03
an  
alternative  
foreign  
power  >>ARG0
(  
in  
this  
case  V04
Iran  
)  
to  
back  V04
them  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

The  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
hope  V01
now  >ARGM-TMP
is  V01
that  
,  
following  
the  
elections  V01
,  
the  
National  
Assembly  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
offer  V01
the  
hand  <ARG1
of  
peace  V01
and  
reconciliation  V01
to  
the  
dissenting  
parties  <<<ARG3
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
suggest  V01
going  V03
for  
tribal  
Sheikhs  <ARG1
rather  
than  
clerics  
,  
since  
they  >>ARG0
have  V03
the  
upper  
hand  <ARG1
in  
their  
areas  <ARGM-LOC
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
effectively  >ARGM-ADV
root  V01
out  
any  
Ba'athists  <ARG1
in  
their  
midst  
in  
return  V05
for  
a  
promise  V01
of  
sharing  V01
power  <ARG1
and  
authority  
.  

Many  >>>ARG1
of  
these  
Sheikhs  
have  V01
been  V03
disenfranchised  V01
and  
abused  V01
over  
the  
last  
two  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Very  
recently  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
US  
forces  >>ARG0
in  
Al  
-  
Anbar  
made  VLV
a  
terrible  >ARGM-ADJ
blunder  V02
by  
accidentally  >ARGM-MNR
killing  V01
Abdul  <ARG1
-  
Razaq  
Inad  
Al  
-  
Gu'ud  
,  
Sheikh  
of  
the  
Al  
-  
Bu  
Nimr  
clan  
from  
the  
powerful  
Dulaym  
tribe  
.  

Al  >>>ARG1
-  
Gu'ud  
had  V01
favoured  
elections  V01
and  
was  V01
in  
good  
terms  <ARG2
with  
the  
government  
.  

The  
Gu'ud  
family  >>>ARG3
even  >ARGM-ADV
accepted  V01
to  
be  V03
offered  V01
the  
seat  <ARG1
of  
Al  
-  
Anbar  
governor  
some  
months  
back  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
Al  
-  
Bu  
Nimr  >ARG1
in  
Ramadi  
and  
Al  
-  
Qaim  
rose  V01
in  
arms  <ARGM-MNR
against  
Saddam  <ARGM-GOL
in  
the  
mid-nineties  <ARGM-TMP
following  
the  
execution  V01
of  
Thamir  <ARG1
Madhlum  
Al  
-  
Dulaymi  
,  
an  
Air  
Force  
general  >ARG0
belonging  V01
to  
their  
tribe  <ARG1
.  

The  
revolt  >>>ARG1
took  V10
two  
weeks  <ARG1
to  
be  V03
suppressed  V01
by  
the  
Republican  
Guard  <ARG0
.  

Another  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
step  V01
was  V01
the  
recent  >ARGM-TMP
arrest  V01
of  
Sheikh  
Hassan  <ARG1
Al  
-  
Lihabi  
,  
of  
the  
Lihaib  
tribe  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V03
scattered  V01
between  
the  
governorates  <ARG2
of  
Al  
-  
Anbar  
,  
Mosul  
and  
Salah  
Al  
-  
Din  
.  

Al  >>>ARG1
-  
Lihaibi  
was  V03
running  V02
in  
elections  V01
and  
is  V03
now  >ARGM-TMP
said  V01
to  
have  V01
withdrawn  V01
following  
this  
incident  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
believe  V01
national  >ARG0
reconciliation  V01
to  
be  V01
the  
only  
path  <ARG2
forward  
to  
a  
new  
Iraq  
.  

The  
Shia  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
live  V01
without  
the  
Sunnis  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
vice  
versa  
.  

Both  >>ARG0
have  V01
shared  V01
this  
country  <ARG1
for  
the  
last  
14  
centuries  <ARGM-TMP
and  
there  
is  V02
no  
possible  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
that  >R-ARGM-MNR
one  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
live  V02
without  
the  
other  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Even  >ARG2
partition  V01
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
possibility  <ARG2
,  
there  
are  V02
no  
clear  
borders  <ARG1
between  
the  
two  
.  

Remember  V01
Luis  <ARG1
Posada  
Carriles  
?  

Here  >ARG2
's  V01
a  
Miami  
Herald  >ARG0
interview  V01
with  
the  
relaxed  
terrorist  <ARG1
and  
former  
CIA  
operative  
in  
a  
luxury  
condo  <ARGM-LOC
,  
published  V01
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

(  
"  
At  
first  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
hid  V01
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT
.  

I  >ARG0
thought  V01
the  
US  
government  >>ARG0
was  V03
looking  V01
for  
me  <ARG1
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
hide  V01
a  
lot  
less  <ARGM-EXT
.  
"  
)  

Because  
of  
such  >ARGM-EXT
talk  V01
,  
Posada  >>>ARG1
has  V01
been  V03
taken  V01
into  
custody  <ARG3
by  
Immigration  
officials  <ARG0
.  

I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
imagine  V01
they  >>ARG0
wanted  V01
to  
do  V02
this  <ARG1
.  

Authorities  >>>ARG0
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
likely  >>>ARGM-ADV
have  V01
been  V01
happy  V01
answering  V01
questions  V01
about  
Posada  
's  
whereabouts  <ARG1
with  
an  
indefinite  
shrug  <<ARG2
.  

As  
recently  >ARGM-TMP
as  
last  
week  
the  
official  
line  >ARG0
stated  V01
they  >ARG0
had  V03
no  
knowledge  <ARG1
he  >>ARG0
had  V01
entered  V01
the  
country  <ARG1
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
comfortable  >>ARGM-ADV
among  
the  
thugs  
,  
Posada  >>ARG0
overplayed  V01
his  
hand  <ARG1
and  
embarrassed  V01
his  
old  
patron  <ARG1
,  
the  
US  
government  
.  

And  >>>ARGM-DIS
though  
he  >>ARG1
'd  V01
been  V01
a  
faithful  
servant  >ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >ARG1
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
such  
a  
player  <ARG2
that  
he  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
get  V08
away  
with  
that  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
taken  V01
a  
cue  <ARG1
from  
another  
bomber  >>ARG1
some  
pesky  
dark  
-  
skinned  
foreigners  >ARG0
want  V01
extradited  V01
,  
CIA  
operative  
Michael  
Meiring  
.  

Posada  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
told  V01
any  
inquisitive  
journalist  <ARG2
at  
his  
doorstep  
something  <ARG1
like  
Meiring  >ARG0
told  V01
the  
single  
American  
reporter  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
bothered  V02
following  V01
his  
bloody  
trail  <ARG1
from  
the  
Philippines  <ARGM-DIR
,  
that  
"  
If  
this  >ARG0
harms  V01
me  <ARG1
in  
any  
way  V01
,  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
find  V01
my  
power  <ARG1
then  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
you  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
find  V03
out  
who  >ARG2
I  >ARG1
am  V01
.  
"  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
then  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
maybe  >>ARGM-ADV
that  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
have  V01
saved  V02
him  <ARG1
either  <ARGM-DIS
,  
because  
Posada  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
Meiring  <ARG2
.  

Posada  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
given  V07
up  
,  
but  
Meiring  
ca  
n't  
.  

Meiring  
's  
crimes  >>>ARG0
are  V01
fresh  V04
,  
and  
wave  V01
the  
false  
flag  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
the  
"  
War  V01
on  
Terror  <ARG2
.  
"  

They  >ARG1
happened  V01
in  
the  
Philippines  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
,  
like  
Pakistan  >ARGM-MNR
,  
is  V01
an  
important  
and  
vulnerable  
node  <ARG2
for  
the  
business  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
intelligence  
agencies  >ARG0
and  
terrorist  
organizations  
conduct  V01
with  
each  
other  <ARGM-COM
.  

(  
Ask  V01
Terry  <ARG2
Nichols  
about  
the  
Philippines  <ARG1
.  
)  

The  
bombings  V01
implicated  V01
Muslims  <ARG1
,  
and  
exacerbated  V01
regional  >ARG1
tensions  V01
which  >>>R-ARG1
the  
Bush  >>>ARG0
regime  
and  
its  
friends  >ARG0
wearing  V01
the  
brass  <ARG1
in  
the  
Philippine  
military  <ARGM-LOC
sought  V01
to  
exploit  V01
.  

Posada  
's  
crimes  >ARG1
,  
on  
the  
other  
hand  >ARGM-DIS
,  
must  >ARGM-MOD
seem  V01
like  
ancient  
history  <C-ARG1
,  
especially  
to  
a  
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
their  
history  <ARG1
.  

And  
to  
those  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
know  V01
their  
crimes  <ARG1
,  
not  
even  
that  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
will  >>ARGM-MOD
Posada  >>ARG1
be  V03
given  V07
up  
?  

I  >ARG0
doubt  V01
he  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
extradited  V01
to  
Venezuela  <ARG3
,  
which  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
that  
question  V01
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
answered  V01
with  
a  
Yes  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
expect  V01
it  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
determined  V01
that  
,  
under  
"  
Strong  
Man  
"  
Hugo  >>ARGM-ADV
Chavez  
,  
Posada  >>ARG2
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
guaranteed  V01
a  
fair  >ARGM-MNR
trial  V02
.  

The  
hope  V01
may  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
that  
Posada  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
soon  >>ARGM-TMP
be  V03
offered  V01
to  
a  
post-Chavez  
Allawi  
-  
like  
puppet  <ARG3
in  
Caracas  
.  

Whether  
such  
an  
offer  V01
were  V03
accepted  V01
or  
declined  V02
would  
make  VLV
no  
difference  V02
;  
justice  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
served  V01
then  <ARGM-TMP
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
Posada  >>ARG1
's  V01
nearly  
80  
years  >ARG2
old  V01
,  
and  
the  
Venezuelan  
people  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
ensure  V01
that  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
vain  >ARGM-ADJ
hope  V01
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
instead  >>ARGM-DIS
Posada  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
held  V01
indefinitely  <ARGM-TMP
,  
in  
comfortable  
custody  <ARG3
.  

An  
embarrassment  
to  
the  
US  
still  
,  
just  
not  
as  
embarrassing  
as  
having  V03
the  
old  
killer  >>ARG0
strut  V01
about  
Miami  <ARG2
,  
gloating  V01
in  
his  
freedom  <ARG1
.  

Meiring  >ARG1
is  V01
more  <ARG2
than  
an  
embarrassment  
.  

His  >ARG2
case  V03
threatens  V01
the  
consensus  
fiction  <ARG2
of  
the  
"  
War  V01
on  
Terror  <ARG2
.  
"  

So  >ARGM-DIS
his  
name  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
remain  V01
unspoken  <ARG3
.  

Another

to  
Philippine

Due  
to  
the  
Judge  >>>ARG0
in  
the  
1983  >ARGM-TMP
case  V03
ruling  V01
that  
a

him  <ARG1

by

the

a  
problem  <ARG1

They  >ARG0

someone  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
convince  V01
the

they  >>>ARG0

to  
see  V01
all  
relevant  
documents  <ARG1

Wilson

Wilson  >>ARG0

claiming  V01
that  
he  >>>ARG0

been  V03
working  V01
for  
the

when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0

the  
C  <ARG1

The

daily  <ARG2

All  
the

publicly  >ARGM-MNR
backed  V01
the  
Karzai  <ARG1

Since  
September  >>>ARGM-TMP
11  
,  
Pakistan  >>>ARG1
has  V01
been  V03
repeatedly  >ARGM-ADV
accused  V01
by  
Afghan  
and  
Western  
leaders  <ARG0
of  
harbouring  V01
Taliban  
extremists  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
had  V01
pledged  V01
to  
disrupt  V01
the  
elections  V01
,  
but  
at  
the  
highest  
level  >>ARGM-LOC
the  
US  >>ARG0
has  V01
avoided  V01
criticising  <ARG1
President  
Pervaiz  
Musharraf  
on  
the  
grounds  <ARGM-CAU

he  >>ARG0

helping  V01
the  
US  >ARG0
catch  V03
Al

elements  <ARG1

That  >ARG1
changed  V01
on

when  >ARGM-TMP
President  >ARG0
George  
W.

was  V03
pushed  V01
together  <ARG2
by  
the  
CIA  >>>ARG0

the  
US  
Defence  
Department  
who  >>>R-ARG0
were  V01
desperately  >ARGM-ADV
anxious  V02
to  
secure  V01
a  
peaceful  >ARGM-MNR

the  
non-interference

Afghan  
diplomats  >>ARG0
intimately  
involved  
with  
the  
meeting  V03

said  V01
Bush  >ARG0
pushed  V02
Musharraf  <ARG1
hard  <ARGM-MNR

reigning  V01

‘’  
It  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
first  
time  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARGM-TMP
Bush  >ARG0
totally  >ARGM-EXT
focused  V01
on  
the

says  V01
a  
Western  
diplomat  <ARG0

the  
diplomat  >ARG0
said  V01

An  
Afghan  
official  >>ARG0
at  
the  
meeting  V03
added  V01
,  
‘’  
The  
Americans  >ARG0

threat  <ARG2

Karzai  >>ARG1
was  V01
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
pleased  V01
at  
the  
results  <ARG0

‘’  
President  >>>ARG0

activity  <ARG1

says  V01
Karzai  <ARG0
.  

The  
next  
day  >ARGM-TMP
an  
angry  
Musharraf  >ARG0
categorically  >ARGM-ADV
said  V01
that  
Pakistan  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
send  V01
Pakistani  
troops  <ARG1
to  
Iraq  <ARG2
,  
a  
clear  
snub  
to  
the  
Americans  
.  

Until  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
had  V01
said  V01
Pakistan  
’s  
options  >>ARG1
were  V01
open  V07
.  

However  >ARGM-ADV
Pakistani  
officials  >ARG0
insist  V01
that  
the  
decision  V01
was  V01
unconnected  <ARG2
to  
the  
tripartite  >ARGM-ADJ
meeting  V03
.  

US  
and  
NATO  
military  
officers  >ARG0
in  
Kabul  
say  V01
it  >>ARG1
is  V01
too  >ARGM-CXN
early  V01
to  
say  V01
whether  
Bush  
’s  
tough  
message  >>>ARG0
was  V01
instrumental  V02
in  
persuading  V01
Musharraf  >ARG0
and  
the  
ISI  
to  
pressure  V01
the  
Taliban  >ARG1
to  
restrain  V01
from  
disrupting  V01
the  
elections  V01

However  >ARGM-ADV
there  
were  V02
visible  >ARGM-ADJ
signs  V07
of  
a  
crackdown  <ARG1
on  
the  
Pakistan  >ARG1
side  V01
.  

‘’  
Pakistan  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
has  V03
a  
large  
force  >>ARG1

says  V01
Lt.

David  <ARG0
Barno  
.  

‘’

goes  V15
on  
both  
ways  V01

’’  
he  >ARG0
adds  V01
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
several  
days  
before  
the  
elections  V01
Pakistan  >ARG0
closed  V01
the  
border  >ARG1
crossing  V02
point  >ARG1
at  
Chaman  
in  
Baluchistan

is  V01
a  
key  
entry  
point  <ARG2
for  
the  
Taliban  
into  
Afghanistan

However  >ARGM-ADV
US  
military  
officers  >ARG0

regular  
army  
officers  >>>ARG1
-  
many  
of  
them

units  >ARG1

the  
Frontier  
Corps

deeply  <ARG3
sympathetic  <ARG3
to  
the  
Taliban

the  
mullahs  
of  
the  
JUI  
.  

At  
the  
same  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
US  >>ARG0
remains  V01
oblivious  V01
of  
the  
serious  
problems  >>>ARG1

political  >ARGM-ADJ
fallout  V01
which  >>R-ARG1

Not  
only  
is  V03
the  
army  >ARG0
facing  V01
serious  >ARGM-ADJ
political  >ARGM-ADJ
fallout  V01

growing  
anti-Americanism

anti-army  >ARG1
feeling  V01
in

it  >>ARG0
is  V03

heavy  
casualties  <ARG1

between  
400

500

soldiers  >>>ARG1
have  V01
been  V03
killed  V01
in  
the  
region  <ARGM-LOC
since  
March  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Musharraf  >>ARG0
has  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
maintained  V01
that  
the  
US  >>ARG0
has  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
provided  V01
actionable  
intelligence  <ARG1
about  
Taliban  
leaders  >ARG0
hiding  V01
in  
Baluchistan  <ARGM-LOC
.  

That  >ARG1
too  >ARGM-ADV
may  >ARGM-MOD
change  V01
.  

US  
and  
Afghan  
intelligence  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
shortly  >>ARGM-TMP
be  V03
presenting  V01
the  
ISI  <ARG2
with  
a  
list  <ARG1
of  
Taliban  
extremists  
and  
their  
suspected  
whereabouts  
.  

Moreover  >ARGM-ADV
there  
are  V02
now  <ARGM-TMP
major  >ARGM-ADJ
covert  >ARGM-MNR
attempts  V01
under  
way  V01
to  
try  V01
and  
bring  V01
back  <ARG2
to  
Kabul  
leading  
Taliban  
commanders  >>>ARG0

who  >>>R-ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
living  V01
quietly  <ARGM-MNR
in

and  
have  V01
taken  V01
no  
part  <ARG1
in  
the  
Taliban  
insurgency  <ARGM-LOC

With  
the  
Taliban  
failure  >>>ARGM-ADV
to  
disrupt  V01
the  
Afghan  >ARG0
elections  V01
,  
the  
militants  >ARG1
are  V01
even  
more  
isolated  <ARG2
from  
the  
mainstream  
Taliban  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG1

to  
return  V01
home  <ARG4

Until  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
Pakistan  >>ARG0
has  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
facilitated  V01
such  
a  
return  V01
and  
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
happen  V01
until  
there  
is  V02
both  
a  
pull  V01
from  
Kabul  <ARG0

a  
push  V01
from

With

certain  V01

win  V01
the

the  
demotion  V01

key  
former  
Northern  
Alliance  
figures  <ARG1
such  
as  
General  
Fahim

warlord  
Ismail  
Khan  
,  
there  
is  V02
now  <ARGM-TMP
little  
reason  <ARG1
for  
moderate  
Taliban  
leaders  >ARG0
to  
fear  V01
reprisals  <ARG1
from  
former  
Northern  
Alliance  
figures  
if  
they  >ARG1
return  V01
home  <ARG4
.  

Their  >ARG1
removal  V01
should  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-ADV
provide  V01
increased  >ARGM-PRD
motivation  V01
for  
Pakistan  >ARG0
to  
help  V01
the  
return  V01

moderate

Afghan  
officials  >ARG0
welcomed  V01
the  
appointment  V01
on  
October  <ARGM-TMP

of  
Lt.  
General  
Ashfaq  <ARG1
Kiyani

Kayani  >>>ARG1

liked  V01

issues  V02
related  <ARGM-ADJ

Karzai  >>ARG0

has  V02
to  
deal  V01
with  
the  
stepped  
up  
rivalry  <ARG2
between  
India  
and  
Pakistan  
in  
Afghanistan

Islamabad  >ARG0
accuses  V01

using  V01
its  
consulates  <ARG1

Both

deny  V01

‘’

the  
head  
of  
Afghanistan  
’s  
National  
Security  
Directorate

Karzai  >ARG0
categorically  >ARGM-ADV
said  V01
that  
he  >>ARG0
has  V01
assured  V01
Musharraf  <ARG1
repeatedly  <ARGM-ADV
that  
any  
adverse  >ARGM-ADJ

diplomats  <<ARG0

upon  <C-ARG1
swiftly  <ARGM-MNR

Senior  
US  
diplomats  >>ARG0
and  
military  
officials  
have  V01
warned  V01
India  <ARG2
also  <ARGM-DIS
.  

In  
a  
major  >ARGM-EXT
regional  >ARGM-ADJ
shift  V01
reflecting  V01
the  
newly  
strengthened  
position  <ARG2
of  
Karzai  
,  
Iran  >>>ARG0
,  
Russia  
and  
India  
which  >>R-ARG0
have  V01
traditionally  >ARGM-ADV
backed  V01
the  
Tajik  
dominated  
former  
Northern

strenuous  >ARGM-MNR
efforts  V01

Qanooni  
to  
strike  VLV
a  
deal  V01

Karzai  <ARG1
before  
the  
elections  V01
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
oppose  V01
Karzai  <ARG1
.  

Iran  >ARG0
in  
particular  
feared  V01
that  
Qanooni  >>>ARG1
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
loose  V03
and  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
be  V03
politically  >ARGM-MNR
isolated  V01
from  
the  
mainstream  <ARG2

Qanooni  >>ARG0
refused  V01
to  
accept  V01
the  
Iranian  
advice  <ARG1
as  
his  
fellow  
Panjsheri  
Tajiks  >ARG0
urged  V01
him  >ARG0
to  
stand  V11
against  
Karzai  <ARG2
.  

However  >>>ARGM-ADV
since  
the  
elections  V01
Iranian  >ARG0
influence  V01
has  V01
proved  V01
critical  <ARG1
in  
convincing  V01
the  
Hazara  
Shia  
candidate  >ARG0
Mohammed  
Mohaqeq  
to  
accept  V01
the  
results  <ARG1
of  
the

and  
later  >ARGM-TMP
convincing  V01
Qanooni  >ARG0

do  V02
the  
same  <ARG1
.  

With  
the

moderate  >ARGM-ADJ

keen  V02
to

Karzai  <ARG1
so  
that  
the

reduced  V01

However  >>ARGM-DIS
powerful

may  >>ARGM-MOD

trying  V01
to  
undermine  V01
that

a

is  V01
likely  V01
to  
deepen  V01
the  
rift  <ARG1

enhanced  
US  
presence  >>>ARG1
in  
western  
Afghanistan  
was  V03
only  >ARGM-ADV
made  V02
possible  V01
after  
the  
ousting  V01
of  
Ismail  >ARG1
Khan  
,  
the  
warlord  
and  
Governor  
of  
Herat  
province  
last  
month  <ARGM-TMP
,  
who  >R-ARG1
was  V01
a  
close  
ally  <ARG2
of  
Iranian  
hardliners  
.  

Iranian  
officials  >ARG0
say  V01
they  >>ARG0
made  VLV
no  >ARGM-NEG
objections  V01
to  
Khan  
’s  
ouster  <ARG1
because  
they  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
strengthen  V01
Karzai  >ARG0
’s  
campaign  V01
against  
warlords  <ARG1
.  

At  
a  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
of  
heightened  V01
tensions  V01
between  
Tehran  <ARG1
and  
Washington  
over  
Iran  
’s  
nuclear  
weapons  
program  <ARG0
and  
calls  V03
by  
neo-conservatives  <ARG0
in  
Washington  
that  
a  
second  
Bush  >ARG0
term  
should  >ARGM-MOD
deal  V01
with  
Iran  <ARG1
aggressively  <ARGM-MNR
,  
the  
Iranians  >ARG0
fear  V01
that  
Shindand  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
used  V01
as  
a  
listening  
post  <ARG2
,  
spying  
facility  
and  
even  
a  
launching  
pad  
for  
any  
future  >ARGM-TMP
US  >ARG0
actions  V02
against  
Iran  <ARGM-GOL
.  

Afghan  
officials  >ARG0
say  V01
the  
Americans  >>ARG0
have  V01
moved  V01
over  
100  
Special  
Forces  <ARG1
and  
helicopters  
to  
Shindand  <ARG2
.  

However  >ARGM-ADV
General  
Barno  >ARG0
insists  V01
the  
US  
presence  >ARG0
poses  V02
no  
threat  <ARG1
to  
Iran  
.  

‘’  
We  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
very  
small  
number  <ARG1
of  
forces  
in  
Shindand  
with  
a  
few  
helicopters  
,  
’’  
says  V01
Barno  <ARG0
.  

Nevertheless  >ARGM-ADV
this  >ARG0
places  V01
Karzai  <ARG1
in  
a  
difficult  
and  
sensitive  
situation  <ARG2
because  
he  >>ARG0
has  V02
to  
maintain  V01
excellent  >ARGM-MNR
relations  V03
with  
both  
the  
US  <ARG2
and  
Iran  
.  

‘’  
Afghanistan  >>ARG0
has  V01
had  V03
the  
benefit  V01
of  
cooperation  V01
from  
both  
the  
US  <ARG0
and  
Iran  
.  

So  
far  >>>ARGM-ADV
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
have  V01
done  V02
together  <ARGM-MNR
has  V01
been  V01
good  V02
for  
us  <ARG2
and  
that  >ARG1
’s  V01
how  >>ARG2
we  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
keep  V02
it  <ARG1
’’  
,  
says  V01
Karzai  <ARG0
.  

Nobody  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
claim  V01
that  
the  
interference  >ARG1
of  
Afghanistan  
’s  
neighbours  
is  V01
over  <ARG2
,  
but  
the  
elections  V01
will  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
much  >>ARG0
to  
strengthen  V01
Karzai  <ARG1
and  
deal  V01
more  
firmly  <ARGM-MNR
with  
neighbours  
’  
interference  <ARG1
.  

In  
the  
post  
election  
scenario  >>>ARGM-LOC
it  
is  V03
becoming  V01
abundantly  >ARGM-EXT
clear  V06
that  
the  
Taliban  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
the  
support  V01
of  
the  
Afghan  
people  <ARG0
nor  
the  
Afghan  
Pashtuns

In

that  
if  
they  >>ARG0

and

they  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD

Many  
Taliban  >>ARG0

for

.  

It

The  
debate  V01
that  >>R-ARG1
a  
handful  >>ARG0
of  
Texas  
multi-millionnaires  
close  
to  
the  
Bush

have  V01
cleverly  >ARGM-MNR
manufactured  V01
over  
John  
Kerry

absurd  V01
in  
every

.  

The

that  
they  >>ARG0

put  V03
some

up  <ARG2
to  
making  VLV
against  
Kerry  <<<ARG1

false  <ARG2

can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
demonstrated  V01
by  
the  
historical

to  
be  V01
false  <ARG2

Most  >>>ARG0

have  V01
even  >ARGM-ADV
flip  V_

flopped  >C-V

contradicting  V01
themselves  <ARG1

Or  >>>ARGM-DIS
they  >>>ARG0
were  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
eyewitnesses  <ARG2
and  
are  V03
just  >ARGM-ADV
lying  V08
.  

But  >>>ARGM-DIS
to  
address  V02
the  
substance  <ARG1
of  
this  
Big  >ARGM-ADJ
Lie  V08
is  V01
to  
risk  V01
falling  V10
into  
its  
logic  <ARG2
.  

The  
true  
absurdity  >>ARG1
of  
the  
entire  
situation  
is  V03
easily  >ARGM-ADV
appreciated  V02
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
consider  V02
that  
George  >ARG0

never  >ARGM-NEG
showed  V01
any  
bravery  <ARG1
at  
all  
at  
any  
point  <ARGM-TMP
in  
his

.  

He  >>ARG0

never  >ARGM-NEG
lived  V01
in  
a

zone  <ARGM-LOC

If  
some  >>ARG1

were  V01

saved  V02
a  
man

while  
under  
fire  V01
.  

Bush  >ARG0
did  V02
no

What  >>ARG1
was  V03
Bush  >ARG0
doing  V02
with  
his  
youth  <ARG2
?  

He  >>ARG0
was  V03
drinking  V01
.  

He  >>ARG0
was  V03
drinking  V01
like  
a  
fish  <ARGM-MNR
,  
every  
night  <ARGM-TMP
,  
into  
the  
wee  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
.  

For  
decades  
.  

He  >>>ARG1
gave  VLV
no  
service  V02
to  
anyone  <ARG2
,  
risked  V01
nothing  <ARG1
,  
and  
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV

off

The  
history  >>ARG1
of  
alcoholism

possibly  >ARGM-ADV
other  >ARGM-ADJ

is  V01
a  
key  >ARGM-ADJ
issue  V02
because  
it  >>ARG0
not

speaks  V01
to

character  <ARG2
as  
an  
addictive

may  >ARGM-MOD
tell  V01

something  <ARG1
about  
his  >ARG0
erratic  >ARGM-ADJ
and  
alarming  
actions  V02
as  
president  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

His  
explosive  
temper  >>ARG0
probably  >ARGM-ADV
provoked  V01
the  
disastrous  
siege  <ARG1
of  
Fallujah  
last  
spring  
,  
killing  V01
600  
Iraqis  <ARG1
,  
most  
of  
them  
women  
and  
children  
,  
in  
revenge  <ARGM-CAU
for  
the  
deaths  V01
of  
4  
civilian

one  
of

That

only  
one

Bush  >ARG0
has  V03
a  
sadistic

He  >>ARG0
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
enjoyed  V01

as

watching  V01
executions  V01

His  
delight  >>ARG1
in

people  <ARG1
became  V01
a  
campaign  >ARG0
issue  V02
in  
2000  <<ARGM-TMP
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >>>ARG0

,

to  
enjoy  V01
the  
prospect  V02
of  
executing  <ARG1

a  
little  
too  
much  <<ARGM-EXT

He  >>>ARG0
has  V01
clearly  >ARGM-ADV

enjoying  V01

the

to

he  >>ARG1

to  
get  V05
on  
the  
wagon  <ARG2
(  
though  
with  
that  
pretzel  
incident  >ARGM-ADV
,  
you  >ARG0
wonder  V01
how  
firmly  <ARG1
)  
is  V01
laudable  <ARG2

But  
he  >ARG0

the

since  
he  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
most  
powerful  
man  <ARG2
in  
the  
world  
.  

We  >ARG0
all  
know  V01
by  
now  <ARGM-TMP
that

Whether

actually  
AWOL  >>ARG1

unclear  V01

GOODWYN  
:  
The  
candidate  >>>ARG1
Mr.  >>ARG0
Bush  
was  V03
working  V01
for  <C-ARG2
,  
Red  
Blount  
,  
had  V01
gotten  V03
rich  V01
in  
Alabama  <ARGM-LOC
in  
the  
construction  
business  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Prominent  
Southern  
Republicans  >ARG1
were  V01
something  <ARG2
of  
a  
rare  
breed  
in  
those  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Blount  >ARG0
's  
support  V01
of  
the  
party  <ARG1
led  V03
him  >>ARG1
to  
be  V03
appointed  V01
Richard  
Nixon  
's  
postmaster  
general  <ARG2
.  

In  
Washington  >ARGM-LOC
,  
Blount  >ARG1
became  V01
friends  <ARG2
and  
tennis  
partners  
with  
Mr.  
Bush  
's  
father  
,  
then  
Congressman  
Bush  
.  

That  >ARG1
was  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
26  
-  
year  
-  
old  
Lieutenant  
Bush  >ARG1
came  V01
to  
Montgomery  <ARG4
,  
at  
his  
father  >ARG0
's  
urging  V01
.  
.  
.  

It  
was  V01
Mr.  
Bush  
's  
job  <ARG2
to  
organize  V01
the  
Republican  
county  
chairpersons  <ARG1
in  
the  
67  
Alabama  
counties  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Back  
in  
1972  >>ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
Deep  
South  >>ARGM-LOC
,  
many  
rural  
counties  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
much  <ARG1
in  
the  
way  V01
of  
official  
Republican  
Party  
apparatus  <ARG1
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
throughout  
Alabama  >ARGM-LOC
,  
there  
were  V02
Republicans  >>ARG0
and  
Democrats  
who  >>R-ARG0
wanted  V01
to  
help  V01
Red  <ARG2
Blount  
.  

It  
was  V01
the  
young  
Texan  
's  
job  <ARG2
to  
find  V03
out  
what  >ARG1
each  
county  
leader  >ARG0
needed  V01
in  
the  
way  V01
of  
campaign  >ARG2
supplies  V01
and  
get  V05
those  
supplies  V01
to  
them  <<ARG2
.  

Groom  >ARG0
says  V01
this  
job  >ARG0
helped  V01
Mr.  >ARG0
Bush  
understand  V01
how  >>>ARGM-MNR
even  
in  
a  
statewide  >ARGM-LOC
Senate  >ARG1
campaign  V01
,  
politics  >>ARG1
are  V01
local  V02

Murph  >ARG1
Archibald  
is  V01
Red  
Blount  
's  
nephew  <ARG2
by  
marriage  V01
,  
and  
in  
1972  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
he  >>ARG1
was  V03
coming  V04
off  
a  
15  
-  
month  >ARGM-TMP
tour  V01
in  
Vietnam  <ARG1
in  
the  
infantry  <ARGM-PRD
.  

Archibald  >ARG0
says  V01
that  
in  
a  
campaign  V01
full  <ARGM-ADJ
of  
dedicated  
workers  
,  
Mr.  >ARG1
Bush  
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
one  <ARG2
of  
them  
.  

Mr.  
MURPH  
ARCHIBALD  
(  
Nephew  
of  
Red  
Blount  
)  
:  
Well  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
coming  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
early  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
morning  
and  
leaving  V11
in  
mid-evenings  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Ordinarily  >ARGM-ADV
,  
George  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
come  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
around  
noon  <ARGM-TMP
;  
he  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
ordinarily  >ARGM-ADV
leave  V11
around  
5:30  <ARGM-TMP
or  
6:00  
in  
the  
evening  
.  

GOODWYN  
:  
Archibald  >ARG0
says  V01
that  
two  
months  
before  
the  
election  V01
,  
in  
September  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
'72  
,  
Red  
Blount  
's  
campaign  
manager  >>ARG0
came  V01
to  
him  <ARG4
and  
asked  V02
that  
he  >ARG0
quietly  >ARGM-MNR
take  V12
over  
Mr.  
Bush  
's  
job  <ARG1
because  
the  
campaign  
materials  >>ARG1
were  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
getting  V07
out  
to  
the  
counties  <ARG3
.  

Mr.  
ARCHIBALD  
:  
George  >>>ARG1
certainly  >>ARGM-ADV
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem  V01
to  
have  VLV
any  
concerns  V01
about  
my  >ARG0
taking  V12
over  
this  
work  V01
with  
the  
campaign  
workers  <<ARGM-COM
there  
.  

My  >ARG1
overall  >ARGM-ADJ
impression  V03
was  V01
that  
he  >>>ARG1
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem  V01
as  
interested  V01
in  
the  
campaign  V01
as  
the  
other  
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
were  V03
working  V01
at  
the  
state  
headquarters  <ARG2
.  

GOODWYN  
:  
Murph  >ARG0
Archibald  
says  V01
that  
at  
first  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
he  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
that  
Mr.  >>ARG0
Bush  
was  V03
serving  V01
in  
the  
Air  
National  
Guard  <ARG1
.  

After  
he  >ARG0
found  V03
out  
from  
somebody  <ARG2
else  
,  
Archibald  >>ARG0
attempted  V01
to  
talk  V01
to  
Mr.  <ARG2
Bush  
about  
it  <ARG1
.  

The  
president  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
lieutenant  <ARG2
and  
Archibald  >>ARG1
had  V01
been  V01
a  
lieutenant  <ARG2
,  
too  <ARGM-ADV
;  
he  >ARG0
figured  V01
they  >ARG0
had  V03
something  >ARG1
to  
talk  V01
about  <C-ARG1
.  

Mr.  
ARCHIBALD  
:  
George  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
any  
interest  V01
at  
all  <ARGM-EXT
in  
talking  V01
about  
the  
military  <ARG1
.  

In  
fact  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
broached  V01
the  
subject  <ARG1
with  
him  <ARGM-COM
,  
he  >ARG0
simply  >ARGM-ADV
changed  V01
the  
subject  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG1
was  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
unpleasant  <ARG2
about  
it  
,  
but  
he  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
changed  V01
the  
subject  <ARG1
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
talk  V01
about  
it  <ARG1
.  

GOODWYN  
:  
Far  >ARGM-LOC
from  
Texas  
and  
Washington  
,  
DC  
,  
Mr.  >ARG0
Bush  
enjoyed  V01
his  
freedom  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
dated  V02
a  
beautiful  
young  
woman  >ARG0
working  V01
on  
the  
campaign  V01
.  

He  >>ARG0
went  V17
out  
in  
the  
evenings  <ARGM-TMP
and  
had  V03
a  
good  
time  <ARG1
.  

In  
fact  >ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >ARG0
left  V12
the  
house  <ARG1
he  >ARG0
rented  V01
in  
such  
disrepair  <ARGM-MNR
--  
with  
damage  V01
to  
the  
walls  <ARG1
and  
a  
chandelier  >ARG1
destroyed  V01
--  
that  
the  
Montgomery  
family  >>ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
owned  V01
it  <ARG1
still  >ARGM-TMP
grumble  V01
about  
the  
unpaid  
repair  
bill  <ARG1
.  

Archibald  >ARG0
says  V01
Mr.  >>>ARG0
Bush  
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
come  V04
into  
the  
office  <ARG2
and  
,  
in  
a  
friendly  >ARGM-MNR
way  V01
,  
offer  V01
up  <ARGM-DIR
stories  <ARG1
about  
the  
drinking  V01
he  <ARG0
'd  
done  VLV
the  
night  <<ARGM-TMP
before  
,  
kind  
of  
as  
a  
conversation  
starter  <<<ARGM-PRD
.  

Mr.  
ARCHIBALD  
:  
People  >ARG0
have  V03
different  >ARGM-ADJ
ways  V01
of  
starting  V01
the  
days  <ARG1
in  
any  
office  <ARGM-LOC
.  

They  >>>ARG0
're  V03
going  V04
to  
talk  V01
about  
their  
kids  <ARG1
,  
they  >>>ARG0
're  V03
going  V04
to  
talk  V01
about  
football  <ARG1
,  
they  >>>ARG0
're  V03
going  V04
to  
talk  V01
about  
the  
weather  <ARG1
.  

And  
this  >ARG1
was  V01
simply  <ARGM-ADV
his  
opening  
gambit  <ARG2
;  
he  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
start  V01
talking  V01
about  
that  
he  >>>ARG0
had  V01
been  V01
out  <ARG2
late  <ARGM-TMP
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
before  
drinking  V01
.  

GOODWYN  
:  
Archibald  >ARG0
says  V01
the  
frequency  >>ARG1
with  
which  >R-ARGM-ADV
Mr.  >ARG0
Bush  
discussed  V01
the  
subject  <ARG1
was  V01
off  
-  
putting  <ARG2
to  
him  <ARGM-GOL
.  

Mr.  
ARCHIBALD  
:  
I  >ARG0
mean  V01
,  
at  
that  
time  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG1
was  V01
28  <ARG2
;  
George  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V01
25  <ARG2
or  
26  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
thought  V01
it  
was  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
unusual  V01
that  
someone  >ARG0
in  
their  
mid-20s  
would  >ARGM-MOD
initiate  V01
conversations  V01
,  
particularly  
in  
the  
context  <<ARGM-ADV
of  
something  
as  
serious  
as  
a  
US  >ARG1
senatorial  >ARG1
campaign  V01
,  
by  
talking  V01
about  
their  >ARG0
drinking  V01
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
before  
.  

I  >ARG0
thought  V01
it  >>ARG1
unusual  V01
and  
,  
frankly  >ARGM-ADV
,  
inappropriate  V01
.  

GOODWYN  
:  
According  
to  
Archibald  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Mr.  >ARG0
Bush  
would  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
tell  V01
stories  <ARG1
about  
his  
days  
at  
Yale  
in  
New  
Haven  
,  
and  
how  >>>ARGM-ADV
whenever  >>>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG1
got  V03
pulled  V05
over  
for  
erratic  >ARGM-MNR
driving  V01
,  
he  >>>ARG0
was  V03
let  V01
go  V02
after  
the  
officers  >ARG0
discovered  V01
he  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
grandson  <ARG2
of  
a  
Connecticut  
US  
senator  
.  

Archibald  >>>ARG0
,  
a  
middle  
-  
class  
Alabama  
boy  >>ARG1
--  
who  >>R-ARG1
,  
by  
the  
way  V01
,  
is  V01
now  <ARGM-TMP
a  
registered  
Democrat  <ARG2
--  
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like  V01
that  
story  <ARG1
.  

Mr.  
ARCHIBALD  
:  
He  >ARG0
told  V01
us  <ARG2
whenever  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG1
was  V03
stopped  V01
,  
as  
soon  >>>ARGM-TMP
as  
the  
law  
enforcement  >ARG0
found  V03
out  
that  
he  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
grandson  <ARG2
of  
Prescott  
Bush  
,  
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
let  V01
him  >ARG0
go  V02
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
he  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
always  >ARGM-TMP
laugh  V01
about  
that  <ARG2
.  
"  

Goodwyn  >ARG0
dutifully  >ARGM-MNR
notes  V01
that  
Baba  >>ARG0
Groom  
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
remember  V01
George  >ARG0
telling  V01
drunk  
stories  <ARG1
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
that  >ARG1
means  V01
nothing  <ARG2
,  
since  
they  >ARG1
were  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
the  
sort  >ARG1
of  
things  
guys  >ARG0
like  
Bush  
told  V01
the  
"  
girls  <ARG2
"  
.  

He  >>>ARG0
was  V03
trying  V01
to  
buddy  V01
with  
Archibald  <ARG1
and  
impress  V03
him  <ARG1
.  

Again  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
decades  >>ARG0
of  
this  
sort  
of  
behavior  
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
leave  V13
a  
person  <ARG1
untouched  
.  

Our  
world  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
crisis  <ARG2
and  
our  
Republic  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
danger  <ARG2
.  

It  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
left  V14
in  
the  
hands  <C-ARG1
of  
a  
man  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
spent  V02
his  
life  <ARG1
like  
this  <ARGM-MNR
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
the  
cities  >ARG1
are  V01
on  
fire  V05
with  
the  
burning  
flesh  <<ARGM-MNR
of

Just  >ARGM-ADV
remember  V01
that  
death  V01
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
end  V01

And  >ARGM-DIS
you  >>ARG0
search  V01
in  
vain  <ARGM-MNR
to  
find  V01
just  
one  
law  >ARG1
abiding  V01
citizen  <<ARG1

Just  >ARGM-ADV
remember  V01
that  
death  V01
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG

Afraid  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
time  >ARGM-TMP
today  <ARGM-TMP
to  
discuss  V01
these  <ARG1
,  
but  
some  
stories  >ARG0
need  V01
attention  V02
:  

From  
Wednesday  
's  
Mirror  
the  
headline  
,  
"  
Have  V01
200,000  
AK47s  >ARG1
Fallen  V01
Into  
the  
Hands  <ARG4
of  
Iraq  
Terrorists  
?  
"  

(  
also  >ARGM-DIS
see  V01
this  
thread  <ARG1
on  
the  
RI  
discussion  
board  
)  
:  

Some  
200,000  
guns  >>>ARG1
the  
US  >ARG0
sent  V01
to  
Iraqi  
security  
forces  <ARG2
may  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V03
smuggled  V01
to  
terrorists  <ARG3
,  
it  >>ARG1
was  V03
feared  V01
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
99  
-  
tonne  
cache  >>>ARG1
of  
AK47s  
was  V01
to  
have  V01
been  V03
secretly  >ARGM-MNR
flown  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR
from  
a  
US  
base  <ARGM-DIR
in  
Bosnia  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
four  
planeloads  >>ARG1
of  
arms  
have  V01
vanished  V01
.  

Orders  V01
for  
the  
deal  V01
to  
go  V06
ahead  <ARG2
were  V03
given  VLV
by  
the  
US  
Department  
of  
Defense  
.  

But  >>>ARGM-DIS
the  
work  V01
was  V03
contracted  V03
out  
via  
a  
complex  
web  <ARGM-MNR
of  
private  
arms  
traders  
.  

And  >>>ARGM-DIS
the  
Moldovan  
airline  >>>ARG1
used  V01
to  
transport  V01
the  
shipment  <ARG1
was  V03
blasted  V02
by  
the  
UN  <ARG0
in  
2003  <ARGM-TMP
for  
smuggling  V01
arms  <ARG1
to  
Liberia  <ARG3
,  
human  >ARG1
rights  V05
group  
Amnesty  >>ARG0
has  V01
discovered  V01
.  

It  >ARG1
follows  V01
a  
separate  
probe  >ARG0
claiming  V01
that  
thousands  >>ARG0
of  
guns  
meant  V02
for  
Iraq  
's  
police  <ARG2
and  
army  
instead  >ARGM-ADV
went  V02
to  
al  
-

.  

Amnesty  
chief  
spokesman  
Mike  >ARG0
Blakemore  
said  V01
:  
"  
It  
's  V01
unbelievable  V01
that  
no  
one  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
account  V01
for  
200,000  
assault  
rifles  <ARG1
.  

If  
these  
weapons  >>ARG1
have  V01
gone  V08
missing  <ARG2
it  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
terrifying  >ARGM-MNR
prospect  V02
.  
"  

American  
defence  
chiefs  >ARG0
hired  V01
a  
US  
firm  >ARG0
to  
take  V01
the  
guns  <ARG1
,  
from  
the  
90s  >ARGM-TMP
Bosnian  >ARG1
war  V01
,  
to  
Iraq  <<ARG3

But  >ARGM-DIS
air  
traffic  
controllers  >ARG0
in  
Baghdad  
have  V03
no  
record  <ARG1
of  
the  
flights  V01
,  
which  >R-ARG1
supposedly  >ARGM-ADV

I  >ARG0
read  V01
of  
a  
case  V03
not  
long  <<ARGM-TMP
ago  
when  >>R-ARGM-TMP
some  
people  >>>ARG0
were  V03
trying  V01
to  
get  V04
a  
polygamous  
judge  >ARG0
taken  V07
off  V_
the  
bench  <ARG1
for  
not  >ARGM-NEG
obeying  V01
state  
law  <ARG1
.  

Of  >>ARGM-ADV
course  
law  
enforcement  >>ARG0
has  V01
dragged  V01
it's  
feet  <ARG1
when  >>ARGM-TMP
members  >>ARG0
are  V03
taking  V01
part  <ARG1
in  
the  
activity  <ARG2
themselves  <ARGM-PRD
.  

Personally  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
give  V16
a  
damn  <ARG1
what  >ARG1
adults  >ARG0
do  V02
to  
one  
another  <ARG2
as  
long  <ARGM-ADV
as  
there  
is  V02
no  >ARGM-NEG
abuse  V01
invovled  V01
.  

It  
is  V01
the  
marrying  V02
off  
of  
young  
girls  <ARG1
to  
older  
men  <ARG2
often  
close  
relatives  
that  >R-ARG0
enfurates  V01
me  <ARG1
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
these  
cults  >ARG0
have  V03
multimillions  <ARG1
yet  
the  
women  >ARG0
and  
kids  
live  V01
in  
poverty  <ARGM-MNR
so  
the  
leaders  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
live  V01
the  
high  
life  <ARG1
.  

In  
the  
Warren  
Jeffs  
cult  >ARGM-LOC
he  >ARG0
reassigns  V01
wives  <ARG1
if  
the  
husband  >ARG0
displeases  V01
him  <ARG1
or  
to  
reward  V01
the  
new  
husband  <ARG1
.  

Husbands  >ARG1
marry  V01
mothers  <ARG2
and  
teen  
daughters  
at  
the  
same  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

a  
rare  
form  >>>ARG1
of  
retardation  V01
is  V03
showing  V02
up  
in  
that  
group  <ARGM-LOC
more  <ARGM-EXT
than  
anywhere  
else  
in  
the  
world  
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
genetic  <ARG2
and  
the  
child  >>>ARG1
needs  V01
to  
get  V01
the  
gene  <ARG1
from  
both  
parents  <ARG2
to  
turn  V02
into  
a  
vegetable  <ARG2
instead  
of  
a  
thinking  
child  <ARG2
.  

The  
doctor  >ARG0
begs  V01
them  >>ARG1
to  
stop  V01
intermarrying  V01
but  
they  >ARG0
say  V01
they  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
keep  V02
the  
blood  <ARG1
pure  <ARG2
.  

look  V05
up

more

Also  >ARGM-DIS
look  V05
up  
the  
kingston  
family  <ARG1
.  

One  
member  >>ARG1
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
was  V03
convicted  V01
of  
beating  V01
his  
teen  
daughter  <ARG1
unconcious  <ARGM-PRD
when  >ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG0
ran  V02
away  <ARGM-DIR
from  
'  
marriage  V01
'  
to  
her  
father  
's  
own  
brother  <ARG2
.  

no  
one  >>ARG1
was  V03
charged  V05
for  
forced  V01
marriage  V01
,  
only  
the  
beating  V01
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
we  >ARG0
"  
lost  V02
"  
some  
weapon  <ARG1
?  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
good  
thing  <ARG2
too  <ARGM-ADV
.  

We  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
those  
terrorists  >ARG2
to  
run  V05
out  V_
of  
shit  >ARG2
to  
shoot  V02
at  
us  <ARG1
.  

Then  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
war  V01
might  >ARGM-MOD
stop  V01
&  
all  
those  
juicy  >ARGM-ADJ
profits  V01
would  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
evaporate  V01
.  

What  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
few  
dead

in  
comparison  V01
to  
keeping  V02
all  
those  
defense

awash  <ARG2
in  
all  
that

They  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV

milking  V02
the

one  <ARG1
of  
the

a  
tale  >>ARG0

both  
just

been  V03
drinking  V01
at  
a

the  
Midnight  <ARG2

the

they  >ARG1

The

many

just  >ARGM-ADV

But  >ARGM-DIS
their

It

that

the

I  >>ARG0

The  
freaky  
thing  >ARG1
here  
is  V01
that  
these

the

?  
?  
?  
?  

Talk  V01
about

your

And  >ARGM-DIS
for  
'

above  
,  
think  V01
about  
the  
inversion  
principle  >>ARG1

employed  V02
.  

They  >>ARG0
are  V03
doing  V02
it  <ARG1
deliberately  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Do  V01
you  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
think  V01
GWB  >ARG1
,  
and  
neocons  
in  
general  
are  V01
representative  <ARG2
of  
true  
followers  
of  
Jesus  
of  
Nazareth  
?  

(  
I  >ARG0
know  V01
,  
ignorant  >ARGM-ADJ
question  V01
)  
Then  
why  >ARGM-CAU
call  V01
them  <ARG1
,  
or  
any  
other  
phonies  
'  
Christians  <ARG2

,  
even  
if  
they  >ARG0
themselves  
claim  V01
the  
appellation  V01

They  >ARG1

merely  <ARGM-ADV

Everything  >>ARG1

a  
lie  V08

and  
this  
above  
all  
.  

So  
why  >ARGM-CAU
even  >ARGM-ADV
credit  V01
their  >ARG0
claims  V01
?  

This  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
serves  V01
their  
purposes  <ARG1

They  >>>ARG1
want  V01
to  
be  V03
identified  V01
as  
'

,  
and  
I  >ARG0
fully  >ARGM-EXT
suspect  V01
that  
for  
some  >>>ARGM-ADV
of  
them  
,  
the  
motivation  V01
behind  
their  
subterfuge  <ARG2
is  V01
more  <ARG2
than  
mere  
political  
advantage  
,  
and  
has  V03
a

more  >ARG2

do  V04
with  
the  
black  
magician  
's  
practice  <ARG1
of  
the  
inversion

.  

We  >>ARG1

be  V01
more  
'  
rigorous  <ARG2
'  
about  
how  >ARG2
we  >ARG0
perceive  V01
these  
people  <ARG1

See  V01
them  <ARG1
as  
they  >ARG1
are  V02
,  
not  
for  
what  >>ARG2
they  >>ARG1
claim  V01

Ironically  
(  
or  
perhaps  
not  
)  
,  
the  
notion  >>ARG1
of  
the  
'

and  
'

'  
was  V03
appropriated  V01
by  
the

its  >ARG1
origins  V01
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
traced  V02
back  <ARG2
to  
Jewish  
'

'  
Max  
Nordau  
and  
a  
1892  
book  >>ARG1

When  >>ARGM-TMP

incompetent  V01

it  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
most  
certain  >ARGM-ADJ
sign  V07
that  
they  >ARG0
have  V03
ulterior  
or  
hidden  
motives  <ARG1

They  >ARG0
trust  V01
you  >>ARG1

me  
to  
be  V03

by

while  
they  >ARG0
"

"  

A  
question  V01
:  

Are  V03
the  
adherent  >>>ARG0
of  
'  
Crowleyan  
Thelema  
'  
and  
others  
of  
similar  
ilk  
appropriating  V01
or  
appropriating  V01
from  
the  
appropriators  <ARGM-DIR
to  
redirect  V01
'  
energy  <ARG1
?  
'  

Does  V01
this  
reappropriation  V01
lead  V01
to  <ARG4
or  
originate  V01
from  <ARG2
the  
same  
place  <ARG2
?  

Seems  V01
as  
if  
there  
is  V02
a  
clear  >ARGM-ADJ
distinction  V01
being  V03
made  VLV
between  
the  
'  
imaginary  
'  
Whore  
of  
Babalon  
and  
the  
actually  
Whore  >ARG1
of  
Babylon  
,  
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
this  
global  
system  <ARG2
.  

Is  V01
the  
distinction  V01
accurate  V01
and  
valid  V02
?  

Does  V01
the  
distinction  V01
actually  >ARGM-ADV
exist  V01
?  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
where  >ARGM-LOC
the  
socio  
-  
political  
aspect  >ARG1
of  
this  
conundrum  
comes  V04
into  
play  V01

Confused  
?  

Good  
.  

so  >ARGM-DIS
,  
enemy  >ARGM-DIS

what  >ARG2

your

Why  >>ARGM-CAU

n't  >ARGM-NEG

My  
point  >ARG1

that  
these  >ARG1

you  >ARG0
formulate  V01
your  >ARG0

a  
little  
more  <<ARGM-MNR
specifically

Reporting  V01
from  
the  
town  >>>ARGM-LOC
where  >>>R-ARGM-LOC
Susan  >ARG1
Polk  
's  
trial  V02
is  V03
going  V15
on  
.  

I  >>ARG0
went  V02
across  
the  
bay  <ARG4
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
to  
attend  V01
a  
farmer  
's  
market  <ARG1
and  
music  
event  
.  

Lo  >ARGM-DIS
and  
behold  
,  
the  
Mormons  >ARG1
were  V01
there  <ARG2
with  
a  
booth  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Two  
young  
men  >ARG0
delivering  V01
information  <ARG1
about  
the  
Mormon  
genealogy  
program  
.  

Just  >ARGM-ADV
give  V01
your  
email  <ARG1
and  
/  
or  
phone  
number  
to  
these  
guys  <ARG2
and  
they  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
track  V02
down  
your  
family  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG1
was  V03
amazed  V01
at  
the  
spiel  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
delivered  V01
.  

Kindly  
young  
men  
,  
but  
utterly  
programmed  
and  
brain  
-  
dead  
.  

I  >>ARG0
resisted  V01
asking  V01
any  
questions  V01
that  >>R-ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
required  V01
either  >ARG0
of  
them  
to  
think  V01
.  

It  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V01
too  
painful  <ARG2
to  
watch  V01
.  

Has  V01
anyone  >ARG0
read  V01
the  
letter  <ARG1
purportedly  
from  
Ahmadinejad  
to  
George  
Bush  
?

do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
if  
this  >>>ARG1
has  V01
been  V03
verified  V01
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
succintly  >ARGM-MNR
making  V01
point  <ARG1
after  
succint  
point  
,  
the  
text  >ARG1
of  
the  
letter  
stands  V04
on  
its  
own  
merit  <ARGM-ADV
,  
regardless  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >>ARG0
like  V02
to  
imagine  V01
the  
thought  >ARG1
processes  V02
going  V15
on  
in  
W  
's  
head  <ARGM-LOC
if  
he  >>ARG0
were  V01
to  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
read  V01
the  
letter  <ARG1
,  
but  
it  
is  V01
hard  V02
to  
picture  V01
him  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
reading  V01
this  
letter  <ARG1
.  

As  
I  >ARG0
read  V01
the  
letter  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
considered  V02
the  
vast  >ARGM-EXT
contrast  V01
between  
mind  <ARG1
and  
morality  
of  
whoever  >ARG0
wrote  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
vs.  
that  
of  
the  
mind  
of  
the  
man  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
once  >ARGM-TMP
said  V01
"

In  
scanning  V01
the

I  >ARG0
noticed  V01
the

I  >ARG0

there  
are  V02
no  
serious

fans  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
frequent  V01
RI  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01
wary  <ARG2
of  
jumping  V03
into  
this  
fray  <ARGM-DIR
without  
backup  <ARGM-MNR
,  
that  >ARG1
's  V01
for  
damn  
sure  <ARG2
.  
:)  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01

for  
some  
reason  >ARGM-PRP

wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
let  V01
me  <ARG1
in  <ARG1
today  <ARGM-TMP
...  
but  
sign  V01
me  
TroubleFunk  <ARG2
.  

Tronicus  
:  

Simply  >>ARGM-MNR
,  
the  
questions  V01
permeate  V01
the  
entire  
'  
Western  
(  
Mystery  
)  
Tradition  <ARG1
'  
and  
perhaps  
'  
Eastern  
'  
as  
well  
,  
as  
they  >ARG1
relate  V01
to  
the  
confluence  <ARG2
of  
politics  
and  
spirituality  
.  

For  
example  >ARGM-DIS
,  
is  V01
the  
system  <ARG1
of  
Crowleyan  
Thelema  
a  
failed  >ARGM-PRD
alchemical  >ARG1
process  V02
?  

Or  
was  V03
it  >>ARG1
supposed  V02
to  
initially  >ARGM-TMP
be  V01
a  
process  V02
of  
alchemical  >ARGM-MNR
appropriation  V01
?  

Similarly  >ARGM-ADV
,  
is  V01
invoking  V01
ancient  
Egyptian  
gods  <ARG1
and  
goddesses  
a  
reaffirmation  V01
of  
an  
oppressive  
and  
hierarchical  
system  <ARG1
?  

In  
my  
opinion  >ARGM-ADV
,  
people  >>>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
no  
longer  >ARGM-NEG
afford  V01
to  
partition  V01
out  <ARG2
and  
compartmentalize  V01
personal  
spiritual  
and  
political  
systems  <ARG1
.  

The  
'  
high  
weirdness  >>ARG1
'  
and  
more  
hardcore  
political  
'  
factions  
'  
must  >>ARGM-MOD
perhaps  >>ARGM-ADV
integrate  V01
and  
arrive  V01
at  
a  
synthesis  <ARG4
.  

In  
regards  V01
to  
death  
metal  <ARG1
,  
the  
problem  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
once  
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
a  
question  V03
of  
education  V01
,  
history  
and  
the  
vacuous  >ARGM-ADJ
lack  V01
of  
perspective  <ARG1
in  
American  
culture  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Shall  >ARGM-MOD
we  >ARG0
censor  V01
the  
works  V12
of  
poet  
Charles  <ARG0
Baudelaire  
as  <<ARGM-ADV
well  
?  

Baudelaire  >ARG1
was  V01
perhaps  <ARGM-ADV
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
first  
'  
death  
metal  
'  
artists  
.  

Tronicus  
,  
if  
you  >>ARG0
're  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
checking  V01
this  
thread  <ARG1
:  

A  
bit  
of  
a  
knee  
-  
jerk  >ARG2
reaction  V01
from  
me  
there  
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
apologize  V01
for  
my  
over-generalizations  <ARG1
.  

My  
real  
problem  >ARG1
is  V01
with  
literalist  
fundamentalists  <ARG2
,  
of  
any  
religion  
.  

True  
believers  >ARG1
are  V01
dangerous  
animals  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG1
just  >>ARGM-ADV
get  V03
hung  
up  V08
on  
'  
Christians  <ARG2
'  
,  
as  
they  >ARG1
're  V01
the  
dominant  
form  <ARG2
where  >ARG3
I  >ARG1
come  V01
from  <C-ARG3
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG2
'm  V01
quite  >ARGM-EXT
clear  V06
on  
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
those  >>ARG0
in  
power  
now  
(  
and  
,  
in  
general  
,  
most  
anyone  
at  
the  
top  
of  
a  
pyrimidal  
power  
structure  
)  
tend  V02
to  
use  V01
the  
dominant  
religion  <ARG1
as  
a  
cloak  >ARGM-MNR
to  
hide  V01
their  >ARG0
true  >ARGM-ADJ
motivations  V01
and  
as  
a  
tool  >ARG2
to  
control  V01
the  
masses  <ARG1
.  

It  
boggles  V01
the  
mind  <ARG0
that  
ANYONE  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
take  V04
at  
face  
value  <ARG2
Bush  >ARG0
's  
claims  V01
to  
be  V01
a  
christian  <ARG2
,  
yet  
many  >ARG1
seem  V01
to  
do  V02
just  
that  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
seem  V01
to  
remember  V01
something  <ARG1
about  
'  
by  
their  >ARG0
works  V01
shall  >ARGM-MOD
ye  >ARG0
know  V02
them  <ARG1
.  
"  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
get  V05
my  
hackles  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-DIR
a  
bit  <ARGM-EXT
when  >ARGM-TMP
people  >ARG0
haul  V03
out  
the  
old  >>>ARGM-TMP
'  
Rock  >ARG0
-  
N  
-  
Roll  
made  V02
them  >ARG0
do  V02
it  <ARG1
'  
argument  V01
.  

Whie  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
subscribe  V01
to  
the  
notion  >>>ARG1
that  
the  
things  >>>ARG0
we  >>ARG0
watch  V01
or  
listen  V01
to  <C-ARG1
have  VLV
no  >ARGM-NEG
effect  V01
on  
our  
behavior  <ARG1
(  
which  >>R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
think  V01
is  V01
patently  
rediculous  <ARG2
)  
,  
it  
does  V01
bother  V01
me  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
people  >ARG0
single  V01
out  
a  
specific  
group  >ARG2
of  
people  
to  
pin  V01
the  
blame  V01
on  <<C-ARG2
.  

Sub-cultures  >>>ARG2
(  
as  
the  
lable  >ARG0
implies  V01
)  
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
develope  V01
in  
a  
vacuum  <ARG1
.  

Again  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
the  
problem  >ARG1
is  V01
people  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
sink  V01
to  
far  <ARG2
into  
their  
own  
egos  <ARG4
,  
and  
begin  V02
to  
take  V04
their  
personal  
metaphors  <ARG1
a  
bit  
too  
literaly  <ARG2
.  

These  
people  >>ARG0
are  V01
dangerous  V01
wether  
they  >>>ARG0
're  V03
head  >ARG1
-  
banging  V02
to  
'  
Canibal  
Corpse  <ARGM-ADV
'  
or  
humming  V02
along  <ARGM-PRD
to  
'  
Onward  
Christian  
Soldiers  <ARGM-COM
'  
.  

(  
The  
mixing  V01
of  
religion  <ARG1
and  
militarism  
is  V01
a  
whole  
other  
topic  <ARG2
....  
)  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
nothing  <ARG1
but  
respect  V01
for  
people  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
adhear  V01
to  
non-violence  <ARG2
,  
forgiveness  
,  
and  
charity  
,  
but  
it  
's  V01
important  V01
to  
remember  V01
that  
Christians  >>ARG0
(  
or  
'  
Smartwolves  
'  
)  
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
a  
monopoly  <ARG1
on  
that  
particular  
lifestyle  
.  

Peace  V01
.  

The  
fact  >>>ARG1
that  
the  
US  
government  >>ARG0
and  
media  
are  V03
having  V03
a  
hissy  >ARG2
fit  V04
over  
Venezuela  >>ARG0
wanting  V01
to  
buy  V01
guns  <ARG1
,  
and  
then  >>>ARGM-ADV
200,000  >>>ARG1
of  
the  
guns  >>ARG1

wants  V01
to  
buy  V01
go  V08
missing  <ARG2
on  
their  >ARG0
way  V01
to  
Iraq  <ARG1
is  V01
definitely  <ARGM-ADV
sus  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
guess  V01
those  
guns  >>>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
located  V02
enroute  <ARGM-LOC
to  
Venezuela  
or  
found  V01
in  
storage  V01
there  <<ARGM-LOC
by  
one  <<ARG0
of  
the  
US  
's  
local  
stooges  
and  
they  >ARG0
then  >ARGM-TMP
have  V03
a  
pretext  >ARGM-ADV
to  
ramp  V01
the  
spin  V03
up  <<C-V
a  
notch  <<ARGM-EXT
or  
two

"  
As

I  >ARG1

Government  
official  <ARG2

I  >ARG0
have  V03
no

My  
perspective  >>ARG1

on  
what  >ARG1

see  V01
,  
on

I  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
shared  V01
with  
you  <ARG2
some  
fascinating  
facts  <ARG1
and  
some  
personal  >ARGM-ADJ
thoughts  V01
about  
the  
Israeli  
-  
Arab  >ARG0
conflict  V01
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
touch  V01
upon  
it  <ARG1
only  
in  
passing  V21
.  

I  >>ARG0
prefer  V01
to  
devote  V01
most  <ARG1
of  
my  >ARG0
remarks  V01
to  
the  
broader  
picture  <<ARG2
of  
the  
region  
and  
its  
place  
in  
world  
events  
.  

I  >ARG0
refer  V01
to  
the  
entire  
area  >>ARG2
between  
Pakistan  
and  
Morocco  
,  
which  >>R-ARG2
is  V01
predominantly  
Arab  <ARG2
,  
predominantly  
Moslem  
,  
but  
includes  V01
many  
non-Arab  
and  
also  
significant  
non-Moslem  
minorities  <ARG1
.  

Why  >>ARGM-CAU
do  V01
I  >ARG0
put  V03
aside  <ARG2
Israel  <ARG1
and  
its  
own  
immediate  
neighborhood  
?  

Because  
Israel  >>>ARG1
and  
any  
problems  
related  
to  
it  
,  
in  
spite  >>>ARGM-ADV
of  
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
read  V01
or  
hear  V01
in  
the  
world  
media  <ARG2
,  
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
central  >ARGM-ADJ
issue  V02
,  
and  
has  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
been  V01
the  
central  >ARGM-ADJ
issue  V02
in  
the  
upheaval  V01
in  
the  
region  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
there  
is  V02
a  
100  
year  
-  
old  >ARGM-TMP
Israeli  
-  
Arab  >ARG0
conflict  V01
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
where  >>ARG2
the  
main  >ARGM-ADJ
show  V04
is  V01
.  

The  
millions  >>>ARG0
who  >R-ARG1
died  V01
in  
the  
Iran  
-  
Iraq  >ARG0
war  V01
had  V03
nothing  >ARG2
to  
do  V04
with  
Israel  <ARG1
.  

The  
mass  >ARGM-ADJ
murder  V01
happening  V01
right  
now  <ARGM-TMP
in  
Sudan  >>ARGM-LOC
,  
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
the  
Arab  
Moslem  
regime  >>ARG0
is  V03
massacring  V01
its  
black  
Christian  
citizens  <ARG1
,  
has  V03
nothing  >ARG2
to  
do  V04
with  
Israel  <ARG1
.  

The  
frequent  >ARGM-TMP
reports  V01
from  
Algeria  <ARG0
about  
the  
murders  V01
of  
hundreds  <ARG1
of  
civilians  
in  
one  
village  <ARGM-LOC
or  
another  
by  
other  
Algerians  <ARG0
have  V03
nothing  >ARG2
to  
do  V04
with  
Israel  <ARG1
.  

Saddam  >>>ARG0
Hussein  
did  V01
not  >>>ARGM-NEG
invade  V01
Kuwait  <ARG1
,  
endanger  V01
Saudi  
Arabia  <ARG1
and  
butcher  V01
his  
own

because  
of  
Israel  <ARGM-CAU
.  

Egypt  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
use  V01
poison  
gas  <ARG1
against  
Yemen  <ARGM-GOL
in  
the  
60's  <ARGM-TMP
because  
of  
Israel  <ARGM-CAU
.  

Assad  >>ARG0
the  
Father  
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
kill  V01
tens  <ARG1
of  
thousands  <ARG1
of  
his  
own  
citizens  
in  
one  
week  <ARGM-TMP
in  
El  
Hamma  <ARGM-LOC
in  
Syria  
because  
of  
Israel  <ARGM-CAU
.  

The  
Taliban  >ARG0
control  V01
of  
Afghanistan  <ARG1
and  
the  
civil  >ARGM-ADJ
war  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
had  V03
nothing  >ARG2
to  
do  V04
with  
Israel  <ARG1
.  

The  
Libyan  >ARG0
blowing  
up  V_
of  
the  
Pan  
-  
Am  >ARGM-ADJ
flight  V01
had  V03
nothing  >ARG2
to  
do  V04
with  
Israel  <ARG1
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
go  V25
on  
and  
on  
and  
on  
.  

The  
root  >ARG1
of  
the  
trouble  
is  V01
that  
this  
entire  
Moslem  
region  >>>ARG1
is  V01
totally  
dysfunctional  <ARG2
,  
by  
any  
standard  <ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
word  
,  
and  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V01
so  <ARG2
even  
if  
Israel  >>ARG0
had  V01
joined  V04
the  
Arab  
league  <ARG1
and  
an  
independent  
Palestine  >>ARG1
had  V01
existed  V01
for  
100  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
22  
member  
countries  >ARG0
of  
the  
Arab  
league  
,  
from  
Mauritania  
to  
the  
Gulf  
States  
,  
have  V03
a  
total  >ARGM-ADJ
population  V01
of  
300  
millions  <ARGM-ADJ
,  
larger  
than  
the  
US  
and  
almost  
as  
large  
as  
the  
EU  
before  
its  >ARG1
expansion  V01
.  

They  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
land  
area  <ARG1
larger  
than  
either  
the  
US  
or  
all  
of  
Europe  
.  

These  
22  
countries  >ARG0
,  
with  
all  
their  
oil  
and  
natural  
resources  
,  
have  V03
a  
combined  
GDP  <ARG1
smaller  
than  
that  
of  
Netherlands  
plus  
Belgium  
and  
equal  
to  
half  
of  
the  
GDP  
of  
California  
alone  
.  

Within  
this  
meager  
GDP  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
gaps  >ARG1
between  
rich  
and  
poor  
are  V01
beyond  
belief  <ARG2
and  
too  
many  >>>ARG1
of  
the  
rich  
made  V05
their  
money  <ARG1
not  
by  
succeeding  V01
in  
business  <ARG1
,  
but  
by  
being  V01
corrupt  
rulers  <ARG2
.  

The  
social  
status  >ARG1
of  
women  
is  V01
far  
below  
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
was  V01
in  
the  
Western  
World  <ARGM-LOC
150  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Human  >ARG1
rights  V05
are  V01
below  
any  
reasonable  
standard  <ARG2
,  
in  
spite  <ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
grotesque  
fact  
that  
Libya  >>ARG1
was  V03
elected  V01
Chair  <ARG2
of  
the  
UN  
Human  
Rights  
commission  
.  

According  
to  
a  
report  V01
prepared  V01
by  
a  
committee  <ARG0
of  
Arab  
intellectuals  
and  
published  V01
under  
the  
auspices  <ARG0
of  
the  
U.N.  
,  
the  
number  >>>ARG1
of  
books  >ARG1
translated  V01
by  
the  
entire  
Arab  
world  <ARG0
is  V01
much  >ARGM-EXT
smaller  V01
than  
what  >ARG1
little  
Greece  >ARG0
alone  
translates  V01
.  

The  
total  
number  >>>ARG1
of  
scientific  >ARGM-ADJ
publications  V01
of  
300  
million  
Arabs  <ARG0
is  V01
less  V02
than  
that  <ARG2
of  
6  
million  
Israelis  
.  

Birth  
rates  >>>ARG0
in  
the  
region  
are  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
high  V02
,  
increasing  V01
the  
poverty  <ARG1
,  
the  
social  
gaps  
and  
the  
cultural  
decline  
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
all  >>ARG1
of  
this  
is  V03
happening  V01
in  
a  
region  >>>ARG1
,  
which  >>>R-ARG1
only  
30  
years  
ago  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
was  V03
believed  V01
to  
be  V01
the  
next  
wealthy  
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
world  
,  
and  
in  
a  
Moslem  
area  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
developed  V02
,  
at  
some  
point  <ARGM-TMP
in  
history  
,  
one  <ARG1
of  
the  
most  
advanced  
cultures  
in  
the  
world  
.  

It  
is  V01
fair  V01
to  
say  V01
that  
this  >ARG0
creates  V01
an  
unprecedented  
breeding  
ground  <ARG1
for  
cruel  
dictators  
,  
terror  
networks  
,  
fanaticism  
,  
incitement  V01
,  
suicide  >ARG2
murders  V01
and  
general  
decline  
.  

It  
is  V01
also  <ARGM-ADV
a  
fact  <ARG2
that  
almost  
everybody  >ARG0
in  
the  
region  
blames  V01
this  
situation  <ARG2
on  
the  
United  
States  <ARG1
,  
on  
Israel  
,  
on  
Western  >ARGM-LOC
Civilization  V01
,  
on  
Judaism  
and  
Christianity  
,  
on  
anyone  
and  
anything  
,  
except  
themselves  
.  

A  
word  
about  
the  
millions  
of  
decent  
,  
honest  
,  
good  
people  >>>ARG1
who  >>>R-ARG1
are  V01
either  
devout  
Moslems  <ARG2
or  
are  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
very  >ARGM-EXT
religious  V01
but  
grew  V04
up  
in  
Moslem  
families  <ARGM-MNR
:  
They  >ARG1
are  V01
double  
victims  <ARG2
of  
an  
outside  
world  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
develops  V02
Islamophobia  <ARG1
,  
and  
of  
their  
own  
environment  >ARG0
which  >R-ARG0
breaks  V01
their  
heart  <ARG1
by  
being  V01
totally  
dysfunctional  <ARG2
.  

The  
problem  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
the  
vast  
silent  
majority  >ARG1
of  
these  
Moslems  
are  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
terror  
and  
the  
incitement  V01
,  
but  
they  >>ARG1
also  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
stand  V07
up  
against  
it  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG1
become  V01
accomplices  <ARG2
,  
by  
omission  V01
,  
and  
this  >ARG1
applies  V02
to  
political  
leaders  <ARG2
,  
intellectuals  
,  
business  
people  
and  
many  
others  
.  

Many  >>>ARG0
of  
them  
can  >ARGM-MOD
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
tell  V02
right  <ARG1
from  
wrong  <ARG2
,  
but  
are  V01
afraid  V01
to  
express  V01
their  >ARG0
views  V02
.  

The  
events  >>ARG0
of  
the  
last  
few  
years  
have  V01
amplified  V01
four  
issues  V02
,  
which  >>>R-ARG1
have  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
existed  V01
,  
but  
have  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
been  V01
as  
rampant  <ARG2
as  
in  
the  
present  >ARGM-TMP
upheaval  V01
in  
the  
region  <ARGM-LOC
.  

A  
few  
more  
years  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
pass  V03
before  
everybody  >ARG0
acknowledges  V01
that  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
World  
War  <ARG2
,  
but  
we  >ARG1
are  V01
already  <ARGM-TMP
well  
into  
it  <ARG2
.  

These  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
four  
main  
pillars  <ARG2
of  
the  
current  >ARGM-TMP
World  >ARG0
Conflict  V01
,  
or  
perhaps  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
already  >ARGM-TMP
refer  V01
to  
it  <ARG1
as  
"  
the  
undeclared  
World  
War  
III  <ARG2
"  
:  

*  
1  
.  
The  
first  
element  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
suicide  >ARG2
murder  V01
.  
*  

Suicide  >ARG2
murders  V01
are  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
invention  V01
but  
they  >>>ARG1
have  V01
been  V03
made  V02
popular  V02
,  
if  
I  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
use  V01
this  
expression  V01
,  
only  <<<ARGM-TMP
lately  
.  

Even  
after  
September  >ARGM-TMP
11  
,  
it  
seems  V01
that  
most  >>ARG0
of  
the  
Western  
World  
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
yet  >ARGM-TMP
understand  V01
this  
weapon  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
very  
potent  
psychological  
weapon  <ARG2
.  

Its  >ARG0
real  >ARGM-ADJ
direct  >ARGM-ADJ
impact  V01
is  V01
relatively  >ARGM-ADV
minor  V01
.  

The  
total  
number  >>>ARG1
of  
casualties  
from  
hundreds  
of  
suicide  >ARG2
murders  V01
within  
Israel  <ARGM-LOC
in  
the  
last  
three  
years  <ARGM-TMP
is  V01
much  >ARGM-EXT
smaller  V01
than  
those  <ARGM-CXN
due  
to  
car  
accidents  
.  

September  >ARG1
11  
was  V01
quantitatively  <ARGM-ADV
much  
less  
lethal  <ARG2
than  
many  >ARGM-ADJ
earthquakes  V01

More  
people  >ARG1
die  V01
from  
AIDS  <ARGM-CAU
in  
one  
day  <ARGM-TMP
in  
Africa  <ARGM-LOC
than  
all  
the  
Russians  >ARG1
who  >R-ARG1
died  V01
in  
the  
hands  <ARGM-LOC
of  
Chechnya  >ARGM-LOC
-  
based  V01
Moslem  
suicide  
murderers  <ARG1
since  
that  
conflict  V01
started  V01
.  

Saddam  >ARG0
killed  V01
every  
month  <ARGM-TMP
more  
people  <ARG1
than  
all  
those  >ARG1
who  >R-ARG1
died  V01
from  
suicide  >ARG2
murders  V01
since  
the  
Coalition  >ARG0
occupation  V01
of  
Iraq  <ARG1
.  

So  
what  >ARG1
is  V01
all  
the  
fuss  <ARG2
about  
suicide  >ARGM-ADJ
killings  V01
?  

It  >ARG0
creates  V01
headlines  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
spectacular  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
frightening  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
very  
cruel  >ARGM-ADJ
death  V01
with  
bodies  >ARG1
dismembered  V01
and  
horrible  >ARGM-ADJ
severe  >ARGM-ADJ
lifelong  >ARGM-ADJ
injuries  V01
to  
many  <ARG1
of  
the  
wounded  
.  

It  >>ARG1
is  V03
always  >ARGM-TMP
shown  V01
on  
television  <ARGM-LOC
in  
great  
detail  <ARGM-MNR
.  

One  
such  >ARGM-ADJ
murder  V01
,  
with  
the  
help  V01
of  
hysterical  >ARGM-ADJ
media  >ARG0
coverage  V03
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
destroy  V01
the  
tourism  
industry  <ARG1
of  
a  
country  
for  
quite  
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
,  
as  
it  
did  V01
in  
Bali  <<ARGM-PRD
and  
in  
Turkey  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
real  >ARGM-ADJ
fear  V01
comes  V03
from  
the  
undisputed  
fact  <ARG2
that  
no  >ARGM-NEG
defense  V01
and  
no  >ARGM-NEG
preventive  >ARG1
measures  V02
can  >ARGM-MOD
succeed  V01
against  
a  
determined  
suicide  
murderer  <ARG1
.  

This  >>ARG0
has  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
yet  >ARGM-TMP
penetrated  V01
the  
thinking  V01
of  
the  
Western  
World  <ARG0
.  

The  
U.S.  >>ARG0
and  
Europe  
are  V03
constantly  >ARGM-TMP
improving  V01
their  >ARG0
defense  V01
against  
the  
last  >ARGM-TMP
murder  V01
,  
not  
the  
next  
one  
.  

We  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
arrange  V01
for  
the  
best  
airport  
security  <ARG1
in  
the  
world  
.  

But  
if  
you  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
murder  V01
by  
suicide  <ARG2
,  
you  >>>ARG0
do  V01
not  
have  V02
to  
board  V01
a  
plane  <ARG1
in  
order  
to  
explode  V01
yourself  <ARG1
and  
kill  V01
many  
people  <ARG1
.  

Who  >>>ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
stop  V01
a  
suicide  >ARG2
murder  V01
in  
the  
midst  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
crowded  
line  >ARG1
waiting  V01
to  
be  V03
checked  V01
by  
the  
airport  
metal  
detector  <ARG0

How  
about  
the  
lines  
to  
the  
check  
-  
in  
counters  
in  
a  
busy  
travel  
period

Put  V01

No

some  >>ARG0
of  
the

to

to

if  
this  >ARG1

?  

Are  V01

they  >ARG1
interested  V01

the

Instead  >ARGM-ADV

send  V02
outcast

naive  
children

retarded

They  >>ARG0

the  
delights  <ARG2
,  
mostly  
sexual  
,  
of  
the  
next

pay  V01
their

handsomely  <ARGM-MNR
after  
the

is  V03
performed  V01

enough  
innocent  
people  >ARG1

dead  <ARG2

Suicide  >ARG2

also  >ARGM-DIS
have  V03
nothing  >ARG2
to  
do  V04
with  
poverty  <ARG1
and  
despair  
.  

The  
poorest  
region  >ARG1
in  
the  
world  
,  
by  
far  >ARGM-EXT
,  
is  V01
Africa  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
happens  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

There  
are  V02
numerous  
desperate  
people  <ARG1
in  
the  
world  <ARGM-LOC
,  
in  
different  
cultures  <ARGM-LOC
,  
countries  
and  
continents  
.  

Desperation  >>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
provide  V01
anyone  <ARG2
with  
explosives  <ARG1
,  
reconnaissance  V01
and  
transportation  V01
.  

There  
was  V02
certainly  <ARGM-ADV
more  
despair  <ARG1
in  
Saddam  
's  
Iraq  
than  
in  
Paul  
Bremmer  
's  
Iraq  
,  
and  
no  
one  >ARG0
exploded  V01
himself  <ARG1
.  

A  
suicide  >ARG2
murder  V01
is  V01
simply  <ARGM-ADV
a  
horrible  
,  
vicious  
weapon  <ARG2
of  
cruel  
,  
inhuman  
,  
cynical  
,  
well  
-  
funded  
terrorists  
,  
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
regard  V01
to  
human  
life  <ARG1
,  
including  
the  
life  
of  
their  
fellow  
countrymen  
,  
but  
with  
very  
high  >ARGM-ADJ
regard  V01
to  
their  >ARG1
own  >ARGM-GOL
affluent  >ARGM-MNR
well  >ARGM-MNR
-  
being  V02
and  
their  
hunger  
for  
power  
.  

The  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
to  
fight  V01
this  
new  
"  
popular  
"  
weapon  <ARG1
is  V01
identical  V01
to  
the  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
in  
which  >R-ARGM-MNR
you  >ARG0
fight  V01
organized  
crime  <ARG1
or  
pirates  
on  
the  
high  
seas  
:  
the  
offensive  >ARGM-MNR
way  V01
.  

Like  
in  
the  
case  V04
of  
organized  
crime  <ARG1
,  
it  
is  V01
crucial  <ARG2
that  
the  
forces  >ARG1
on  
the  
offensive  
be  V01
united  <ARG2
and  
it  
is  V01
crucial  <ARG2
to  
reach  V01
the  
top  <ARG1
of  
the  
crime  
pyramid  
.  

You  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
eliminate  V01
organized  
crime  <ARG1
by  
arresting  V01
the  
little  
drug  
dealer  <ARG1
on  
the  
street  
corner  
.  

You  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
go  V03
after  
the  
head  <ARG1
of  
the  
"  
Family  
"  
.  

If  
part  >ARG0
of  
the  
public  
supports  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
others  >ARG0
tolerate  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
many  >>ARG0
are  V01
afraid  V01
of  
it  <ARG1
and  
some  >>ARG0
try  V01
to  
explain  V01
it  <ARG1
away  <ARGM-PRD
by  
poverty  <ARGM-MNR
or  
by  
a  
miserable  
childhood  
,  
organized  
crime  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
thrive  V01
and  
so  
will  
terrorism  
.  

The  
United  
States  >ARG0
understands  V01
this  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
after  
September  <ARGM-TMP
11  
.  

Russia  >>>ARG0
is  V03
beginning  V02
to  
understand  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

Turkey  >ARG0
understands  V01
it  <ARG1
well  <ARGM-EXT
.  

I  >>ARG0
am  V01
very  
much  >ARGM-EXT
afraid  V01
that  
most  >>ARG0
of  
Europe  
still  >>ARGM-TMP
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
understand  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

Unfortunately  >ARGM-ADV
,  
it  
seems  V01
that  
Europe  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
understand  V01
it  <ARG1
only  
after  
suicide  >ARG2
murders  V01
arrive  V01
in  
Europe  <ARG4
in  
a  
big  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
.  

In  
my  
humble  
opinion  >ARGM-ADV
,  
this  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
happen  V01
.  

The  
Spanish  
trains  >>ARG1
and  
the  
Istanbul  >ARG1
bombings  V01
are  V01
only  >ARGM-ADJ
the  
beginning  V01
.  

The  
unity  >>>ARG1
of  
the  
Civilized  
World  
in  
fighting  V01
this  
horror  <ARG1
is  V01
absolutely  >ARGM-EXT
indispensable  V01
.  

Until  
Europe  >ARG1
wakes  V02
up  
,  
this  
unity  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
achieved  V01
.  

*  
2  
.  
The  
second  
ingredient  >ARG1
is  V01
words  <ARG2
,  
more  
precisely  >ARGM-ADJ
lies  V08
.  
*  

Words  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
lethal  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG0
kill  V01
people  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
is  V03
often  >ARGM-TMP
said  V01
that  
politicians  >ARG0
,  
diplomats  
and  
perhaps  
also  
lawyers  
and  
business  
people  
must  >ARGM-MOD
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
lie  V08
,  
as  
part  <ARGM-ADV
of  
their  
professional  
life  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
norms  >>ARG1
of  
politics  
and  
diplomacy  
are  V01
childish  V01
,  
in  
comparison  V01
with  
the  
level  <ARG2
of  
incitement  V01
and  
total  >ARGM-ADJ
absolute  >ARGM-ADJ
deliberate  >ARGM-ADJ
fabrications  V01
,  
which  >>R-ARG0
have  V01
reached  V01
new  
heights  <ARG1
in  
the  
region  >>ARG1
we  >>ARG0
are  V03
talking  V01
about  <C-ARG1
.  

An  
incredible  
number  >ARG0
of  
people  
in  
the  
Arab  
world  
believe  V01
that  
September  >>ARG1
11  
never  >ARGM-NEG
happened  V01
,  
or  
was  V01
an  
American  >ARG0
provocation  V01
or  
,  
even  
better  
,  
a  
Jewish  >ARG0
plot  V01
.  

You  >ARG0
all  
remember  V01
the  
Iraqi  
Minister  <ARG1
of  
Information  
,  
Mr.  
Mouhamad  
Said  
al  
-  
Sahaf  
and  
his  >ARG0
press  >ARG1
conferences  V01
when  >R-ARGM-TMP
the  
US  
forces  >ARG1
were  V01
already  <ARGM-TMP
inside  
Baghdad  <ARG2
.  

Disinformation  >>ARG1
at  
time  
of  
war  V01
is  V01
an  
accepted  
tactic  <ARG2
.  

But  
to  
stand  V01
,  
day  <ARGM-TMP
after  
day  
,  
and  
to  
make  VLV
such  >ARGM-ADJ
preposterous  >ARGM-ADJ
statements  V01
,  
known  <ARGM-ADJ
to  
everybody  
to  
be  V01
lies  V08
,  
without  
even  >>ARGM-ADV
being  V03
ridiculed  V01
in  
your  
own  
milieu  <ARGM-LOC
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
happen  V01
in  
this  
region  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Mr.  >ARG1
Sahaf  
eventually  >ARGM-TMP
became  V01
a  
popular  
icon  <ARG2
as  
a  
court  
jester  <ARGM-PRD
,  
but  
this  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
stop  V03
some  
allegedly  
respectable  
newspapers  <ARG1
from  
giving  V01
him  <ARG2
equal  
time  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-DIS
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
prevent  V01
the  
Western  
press  <ARG1
from  
giving  V01
credence  <ARG1
,  
every  
day  <ARGM-TMP
,  
even  
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
to  
similar  
liars  <ARG2
.  

After  
all  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
you  >>ARG1
want  V01
to  
be  V01
an  
anti-Semite  <ARG2
,  
there  
are  V02
subtle  >ARGM-MNR
ways  V01
of  
doing  V02
it  <ARG1
.  

You  >>>ARG0
do  V01
not  
have  V02
to  
claim  V01
that  
the  
holocaust  >ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
happened  V01
,  
and  
that  
the  
Jewish  
temple  >ARG1
in  
Jerusalem  
never  >ARGM-NEG
existed  V01
.  

But  
millions  >>ARG2
of  
Moslems  
are  V03
told  V01
by  
their  
leaders  <ARG0
that  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
case  V04
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
these  
same  
leaders  >>ARG0
make  VLV
other  >ARGM-ADJ
statements  V01
,  
the  
Western  
media  >ARG0
report  V01
them  <ARG1
as  
if  
they  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
true  V01
.  

It  
is  V01
a  
daily  
occurrence  <ARG2
that  
the  
same  
people  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
finance  V01
,  
arm  V01
and  
dispatch  V01
suicide  
murderers  <ARG1
,  
condemn  V01
the  
act  <ARG1
in  
English  <ARGM-MNR
in

of  
western  
TV  
cameras

talking  V01

a  
world  
audience  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
even  
partly  >ARGM-EXT
believes  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

It  
is  V01
a  
daily  
routine  <ARG2
to  
hear  V01
the  
same  
leader  >>ARG0
making  VLV
opposite  >ARGM-ADJ

in  
Arabic  <ARGM-MNR
to  
his  
people  <ARG3

in

Incitement  V01

Arab  
TV  <ARG0
,  
accompanied  V01
by  
horror  
pictures  <ARG0
of  
mutilated  V01

has  V01
become  V01

of  
those  >>>ARG0

distort  V01
and  
want  V01
to  
destroy  V01
everything  <ARG1

Little

raised  V03
on  
deep  
hatred  <ARGM-MNR

on  
admiration  
of  
so

called  
martyrs

and  
the  
Western  
World  >>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
notice  V01
it  <ARG1
because  
its  
own

mostly  >ARGM-ADV
tuned  V01
to  
soap

I  >ARG0
recommend  V01
to  
you  <ARG2

even  
though  
most  >>ARG0

him  <ARG1
and  
sends  V02
him  <ARG1
is  V03
now  >ARGM-TMP
called  V01
"  
the  
political  
wing  <ARG2
"  
and  
the  
head  >>>ARG1
of  
the  
operation  V01
is  V03
called  V01
the  
"  
spiritual  
leader  <ARG2
"  
.  

There  
are  V02
numerous  
other  
examples  <ARG1
of  
such  
Orwellian  
nomenclature  >ARG1
,  
used  V01
every  
day  <ARGM-TMP
not  
only  
by  
terror  
chiefs  <ARG0
but  
also  
by  
Western  
media  
.  

These  
words  >>ARG0
are  V01
much  
more  >ARGM-CXN
dangerous  V01
than  
many  
people  >ARG0
realize  V01
.  

They  >ARG0
provide  V01
an  
emotional  
infrastructure  <ARG1
for  
atrocities  
.  

It  
was  V01
Joseph  >ARG0
Goebbels  
who  >R-ARG0
said  V01
that  
if  
you  >ARG0
repeat  V01
a  
lie  V08
often  
enough  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
people  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
believe  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

He  >>>ARG1
is  V03
now  >>ARGM-TMP
being  V03
outperformed  V01
by  
his  
successors  <ARG0
.  

*  
3  
.  
The  
third  
aspect  >ARG1
is  V01
money  <ARG2
.  
*  

Huge  
amounts  >>>ARG1
of  
money  
,  
which  >>R-ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
solved  V01
many  
social  
problems  <ARG1
in  
this  
dysfunctional  
part  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
world  
,  
are  V03
channeled  V01
into  
three  
concentric  
spheres  >ARG0
supporting  V01
death  V01
and  
murder  V01
.  

In  
the  
inner  
circle  >ARG2
are  V01
the  
terrorists  <ARG1
themselves  
.  

The  
money  >ARG2
funds  V01
their  >>ARG0
travel  V01
,  
explosives  
,  
hideouts  
and  
permanent  >ARGM-TMP
search  V01
for  
soft  
vulnerable  
targets  <ARG2
.  

The  
inner  
circles  >>ARG1
are  V03
primarily  >ARGM-ADV
financed  V01
by  
terrorist  
states  <ARG0
like  
Iran  
and  
Syria  
,  
until  
recently  
also  
by  
Iraq  
and  
Libya  
and  
earlier  
also  
by  
some  
of  
the  
Communist  
regimes  
.  

These  
states  >ARG1
,  
as  
well  
as  
the  
Palestinian  
Authority  
,  
are  V01
the  
safe  
havens  <ARG2
of  
the  
wholesale  
murder  
vendors  
.  

They  >>ARG2
are  V03
surrounded  V01
by  
a  
second  
wider  
circle  <ARG1
of  
direct  
supporters  >ARG0
,  
planners  
,  
commanders  
,  
preachers  
,  
all  >R-ARG0
of  
whom  
make  V05
a  
living  V01
,  
usually  >ARGM-TMP
a  
very  
comfortable  >ARGM-ADJ
living  V01
,  
by  
serving  V01
as  
terror  
infrastructure  <ARG1
.  

Finally  >ARGM-TMP
,  
we  >ARG0
find  V01
the  
third  
circle  >>>ARG0
of  
so  
-  
called  
religious  
,  
educational  
and  
welfare  
organizations  
,  
which  >>>R-ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
do  V02
some  
good  <ARG1
,  
feed  V01
the  
hungry  <ARG1
and  
provide  V01
some  
schooling  V01
,  
but  
brainwash  V01
a  
new  
generation  <ARG1
with  
hatred  <ARGM-MNR
,  
lies  V08
and  
ignorance  
.  

This  
circle  >ARG1
operates  V01
mostly  
through  
mosques  <ARGM-MNR
,  
madrasas  
and  
other  
religious  
establishments  
but  
also  
through  
inciting  V01
electronic  
and  
printed  
media  <ARG1
.  

It  
is  V01
this  
circle  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
makes  V02
sure  V01
that  
women  >>ARG1
remain  V01
inferior  V01
,  
that  
democracy  >ARG1
is  V01
unthinkable  <ARG2
and  
that  
exposure  V01
to  
the  
outside  
world  <ARG2
is  V01
minimal  V02
.  

It  
is  V01
also  <ARGM-DIS
that  
circle  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
leads  V02
the  
way  V01
in  
blaming  V01
everybody  <ARG1
outside  
the  
Moslem  
world  
,  
for  
the  
miseries  <ARG2
of  
the  
region  
.  

The  
outer  
circle  >>ARG1
is  V03
largely  >ARGM-EXT
financed  V01
by  
Saudi  
Arabia  <ARG0
,  
but  
also  
by  
donations  V01
from  
certain  
Moslem  
communities  <ARG0
in  
the  
United  
States  
and  
Europe  
and  
,  
to  
a  
smaller  
extent  
,  
by  
donations  V01
of  
European  
Governments  <ARG0
to  
various  
NGO's  <ARG2
and  
by  
certain  
United  
Nations  
organizations  >>ARG1
,  
whose  
goals  >>R-ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
noble  V01
,  
but  
they  >>>ARG1
are  V03
infested  V01
and  
exploited  V01
by  
agents  <ARG0
of  
the  
outer  
circle  
.  

The  
Saudi  
regime  >ARG1
,  
of  >ARGM-ADV
course  
,  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
the  
next  
victim  <ARG2
of  
major  
terror  
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
inner  
circle  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
explode  V01
into  
the  
outer  
circle  <ARGM-GOL
.  

The  
Saudis  >>>ARG0
are  V03
beginning  V02
to  
understand  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
but  
they  >>ARG0
fight  V01
the  
inner  
circles  <ARG1
,  
while  
still  >ARGM-TMP
financing  V01
the  
infrastructure  <ARG1
at  
the  
outer  
circle  
.  

Figuratively  >ARGM-MNR
speaking  V01
,  
this  
outer  
circle  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
guardian  >>ARG0
,  
which  >>R-ARG0
makes  V02
sure  V01
that  
the  
people  >>ARG0
look  V01
and  
listen  V01
inwards  
to  
the  
inner  
circle  <ARG1
of  
terror  
and  
incitement  V01
,  
rather  
than  
to  
the  
world  
outside  
.  

Some  
parts  >ARG1
of  
this  
same  
outer  
circle  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
operate  V01
as  
a  
result  <ARGM-CAU
of  
fear  V01
from  <ARG1
,  
or  
blackmail  
by  
,  
the  
inner  
circles  <C-ARG1
.  

The  
horrifying  
added  
factor  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
high  
birth  
rate  <ARG2
.  

Half  >>ARG1
of  
the  
population  V01
of  
the  
Arab  
world  <ARG1
is  V01
under  
the  
age  <ARG2
of  
20  
,  
the  
most  
receptive  
age  
to  
incitement  V01
,  
guaranteeing  V01
two  
more  
generations  <ARG1
of  
blind  
hatred  
.  

Some  >ARG0
of  
the  
leaders  
of  
these  
various  
circles  
live  V01
very  
comfortably  <ARGM-MNR
on  
their  
loot  <ARGM-LOC
.  

You  >ARG0
meet  V02
their  
children  <ARG1
in  
the  
best  
private  
schools  
in  
Europe  
,  
not  
in  
the  
training  
camps  
of  
suicide  
murderers  
.  

The  
Jihad

other  
hotspots  
,  
while  
some  >ARG0
of  
their  
leaders  
ski  V01
in  
Switzerland  <ARGM-LOC

Mrs.  >>ARG0

,  
who  >R-ARG0
lives  V01
in  
Paris  <ARGM-LOC
with  
her  
daughter  <ARGM-COM

receives  V01
tens  <ARG1
of  
thousands  
of  
dollars  
per  
month  <ARGM-TMP
from  
the  
allegedly  
bankrupt  
Palestinian

a  
typical  
local  
ringleader  >>ARG0
of  
the  
Al

Aksa  
brigade  
,  
reporting  V01
to  
Arafat  <ARG2

receives  V01
only  
a  
cash  >ARGM-MNR
payment  V01
of  
a  
couple  
of  
hundred  
dollars  <ARG1
,  
for  
performing  VLV
murders  V01
at  
the  
retail  
level  
.  

*  
4  
.  
The  
fourth  
element  >>ARG1
of  
the  
current  >ARGM-TMP
world  >ARG0
conflict  V01
is  V01
the  
total  >ARGM-EXT
breaking  V18
of  
all  
laws  <ARG1
.  
*  

The  
civilized  
world  >ARG0
believes  V01
in  
democracy  <ARG1
,  
the  
rule  V01
of  
law  <ARG1
,  
including  
international  
law  <ARGM-ADJ
,  
human  >ARG1
rights  V05
,  
free  >ARGM-ADJ
speech  V01
and  
free  
press  
,  
among  
other  
liberties  
.  

There  
are  V02
naive  
old  
-  
fashioned  
habits  <ARG1
such  
as  
respecting  V01
religious  
sites  <ARG1
and  
symbols  
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
using  V01
ambulances  <ARG1
and  
hospitals  
for  
acts  <ARG2
of  
war  V01
,  
avoiding  V01
the  
mutilation  V01
of  
dead  
bodies  <ARG1
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
using  V01
children  <ARG1
as  
human  
shields  <ARG2
or  
human  
bombs  
.  

Never  
in  
history  
,  
not  
even  
in  
the  
Nazi  
period  
,  
was  
there  
such  
total  
disregard  
of  
all  
of  
the  
above  
as  
we  >ARG0
observe  V01
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Every  
student  >ARG0
of  
political  
science  
debates  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
you  >ARG0
prevent  V01
an  
anti-democratic  
force  >>>ARG0
from  
winning  V01
a  
democratic  >ARGM-MNR
election  V01
and  
abolishing  V01
democracy  <ARG1
.  

Other  
aspects  >>ARG1
of  
a  
civilized  
society  
must  >>ARGM-MOD
also  >>ARGM-DIS
have  VLV
limitations  V01
.  

Can  >>ARGM-MOD
a  
policeman  >>ARG0
open  VLV
fire  V01
on  
someone  >ARG0
trying  V01
to  
kill  V01
him  <ARG1
?  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
a  
government  >ARG0
listen  V01
to  
phone  >ARGM-MNR
conversations  V01
of  
terrorists  <ARG0
and  
drug  
dealers  
?  

Does  V01
free  >ARGM-ADJ
speech  V01
protect  V01
you  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
shout  V01
"  
fire  V05
"  
in  
a  
crowded  
theater  <<ARGM-LOC

Should  >ARGM-MOD
there  
be  V02
death  
penalty  <ARG1
,  
for  
deliberate  >ARGM-ADJ
multiple  >ARGM-ADJ
murders  V01
?  

These  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
old  
-  
fashioned  
dilemmas  <ARG2
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
now  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
have  V03
an  
entire  
new  
set  <ARG1
.  

Do  V01
you  >ARG0
raid  V01
a  
mosque  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
serves  V01
as  
a  
terrorist  >ARG0
ammunition  >ARG1
storage  V01
?  

Do  V01
you  >>ARG0
return  V02
fire  V01
,  
if  
you  >>ARG1
are  V03
attacked  V01
from  
a  
hospital  <ARGM-DIR
?  

Do  V01
you  >ARG0
storm  V02
a  
church  >ARG1
taken  V12
over  
by  
terrorists  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
took  V03
the  
priests  <ARG2
hostages  <ARG2
?  

Do  V01
you  >ARG0
search  V01
every  
ambulance  <ARG1
after  
a  
few  
suicide  
murderers  >>ARG0
use  V01
ambulances  <ARG1
to  
reach  V01
their  
targets  <ARG1
?  

Do  V01
you  >ARG0
strip  V01
every  
woman  <ARG2
because  
one  >>>ARG0
pretended  V01
to  
be  V01
pregnant  V01
and  
carried  V01
a  
suicide  
bomb  <ARG1
on  
her  
belly  <ARGM-LOC
?  

Do  V01
you  >ARG0
shoot  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
at  
someone  >>>ARG1
trying  V01
to  
kill  V01
you  <ARG1
,  
standing  V01
deliberately  <ARGM-MNR
behind  
a  
group  <ARG2
of  
children  
?  

Do  V01
you  >ARG0
raid  V01
terrorist  
headquarters  >ARG1
,  
hidden  V01
in  
a  
mental  
hospital  <ARGM-LOC
?  

Do  V01
you  >ARG0
shoot  V02
an  
arch-murderer  >>ARG2
who  >>R-ARG2
deliberately  >ARGM-MNR
moves  V01
from  
one  
location  <ARGM-DIR
to  
another  <ARG2
,  
always  >ARGM-TMP
surrounded  V01
by  
children  <ARG1
?  

All  >ARG1
of  
these  
happen  V01
daily  <ARGM-TMP
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
and  
in  
the  
Palestinian  
areas  
.  

What  >>ARG1
do  V01
you  >ARG0
do  V02
?  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >>>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
face  V01
the  
dilemma  <ARG1
.  

But  
it  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
avoided  V01
.  

Suppose  V01
,  
for  
the  
sake  <ARGM-PRP
of  
discussion  V01
,  
that  
someone  >>>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
openly  >ARGM-MNR
stay  V01
in  
a  
well  
-  
known  
address  <ARG3
in  
Teheran  
,  
hosted  V01
by  
the  
Iranian  
Government  <ARG0
and  
financed  V01
by  
it  <ARG0
,  
executing  V02
one  
atrocity  <ARG1
after  
another  
in  
Spain  <ARGM-LOC
or  
in  
France  
,  
killing  V01
hundreds  <ARG1
of  
innocent  
people  
,  
accepting  V01
responsibility  <ARG1
for  
the  
crimes  
,  
promising  V01
in  
public  >ARGM-ADJ
TV  >ARGM-MNR
interviews  V01
to  
do  V02
more  <ARG1
of  
the  
same  
,  
while  
the  
Government  >>>ARG0
of  
Iran  
issues  V01
public  
condemnations  <ARG1
of  
his  
acts  
but  
continues  V01
to  
host  V01
him  <ARG1

invite  V01
him  <ARG1
to  
official  >ARGM-ADJ
functions  V01
and  
treat  V01
him  <ARG1
as  
a  
great  
dignitary  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
leave  V14
it  <ARG1
to  
you  <ARG1
as  
homework  V01
to  
figure  V05
out  
what  >>ARG1
Spain  >>ARG0
or  
France  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
done  V02
,  
in  
such  
a  
situation  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
problem  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
the  
civilized  
world  >>>ARG0
is  V03
still  >>ARGM-TMP
having  V03
illusions  V01
about  
the  
rule  V01
of  
law  <ARG1
in  
a  
totally  
lawless  
environment  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

It  >>>ARG0
is  V03
trying  V01
to  
play  V01
ice  
hockey  <ARG1
by  
sending  V01
a  
ballerina  
ice  
-  
skater  <ARG1
into  
the  
ring  <ARG2
or  
to  
knock  V03
out  
a  
heavyweight  
boxer  <ARG1
by  
a  
chess  
player  <ARG2
.  

In  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
that  >R-ARGM-MNR
no  
country  >ARG0
has  V03
a  
law  <ARG1
against  
cannibals  >ARG0
eating  V01
its  
prime  
minister  <ARG1
,  
because  
such  
an  
act  >ARG1
is  V01
unthinkable  <ARG2
,  
international  
law  >>ARG0

not  >ARGM-NEG

killers  >ARG0

from  
hospitals  <ARGM-LOC

mosques  
and  
ambulances

while  
being  V03
protected  V01
by  
their  
Government  <ARG0

society

International  
law  >>ARG0
does  V01

throw  V01
stones  <ARG1
,  
stands  V01
behind  
them  <ARG2
and  
shoots  V02
with  
immunity  <ARGM-MNR
and  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
arrested  V01
because  
he  >>ARG1

sheltered  V01
by  
a

is  V03
royally  >ARGM-MNR
and  
comfortably  
hosted  V01
by  
a  
country  >>>ARG0
,  
which  >>>R-ARG1
pretends  V01
to  
condemn  V01
his  
acts  <ARG1
or  
just  >ARGM-ADV
claims  V01
to  
be  V01
too  >ARGM-EXT
weak  V02
to  
arrest  V01
him  <ARG1
.  

The  
amazing  
thing  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
all  >>>ARG0
of  
these  
crooks  
demand  V01
protection  V01
under  
international  
law  <<ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
define  V01
all  
those  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
attack  V01
them  <ARG1
as  
"  
war  
criminals  <<ARG2
,  
"  
with  
some  
Western  
media  >ARG0
repeating  V01
the  
allegations  V01
.  

The  
good  
news  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
all  >ARG1
of  
this  
is  V01
temporary  <ARG2
,  
because  
the  
evolution  V01
of  
international  
law  <ARG1
has  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
adapted  V01
itself  <ARG1
to  
reality  <ARG2
.  

The  
punishment  V01
for  
suicide  >ARG2
murder  V01
should  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
death  V01
or  
arrest  V01
before  
the  
murder  V01
,  
not  
during  
and  
not  
after  
.  

After  
every  
world  >ARG0
war  V01
,  
the  
rules  V01
of  
international  
law  <ARG1
have  V01
changed  V01
,  
and  
the  
same  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
happen  V01
after  
the  
present  
one  <ARGM-TMP
.  

But  >>>ARGM-DIS
during  
the  
twilight  
zone  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
a  
lot  >>>ARG1
of  
harm  V01
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
done  V02
.  

The  
picture  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
described  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
pretty  <ARG2
.  

What  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
we  >ARG0
do  V02
about  
it  <ARG2
?  

In  
the  
short  >ARGM-ADJ
run  V13
,  
only  >>ARGM-ADV
fight  V01
and  
win  V01
.  

In  
the  
long  >ARGM-ADJ
run  V13
,  
only  >>ARGM-ADV
educate  V01
the  
next  
generation  <ARG1
and  
open  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
the  
world  <ARG3
.  

The  
inner  
circles  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
and  
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
destroyed  V01
by  
force  <ARG2
.  

The  
outer  
circle  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
eliminated  V01
by  
force  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Here  >ARGM-LOC
we  >ARG0
need  V01
financial  >ARG2
starvation  V01
of  
the  
organizing  
elite  <ARG1
,  
more  
power  
to  
women  
,  
more  >ARGM-EXT
education  V01
,  
counter-propaganda  
,  
boycott  V01
whenever  
feasible  <ARGM-TMP
and  
access  V01
to  
Western  
media  <ARG1
,  
internet  
and  
the  
international  
scene  
.  

Above  
all  >ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >ARG0
need  V01
a  
total  >ARGM-ADJ
absolute  >ARGM-ADJ
unity  <ARG1
and  
determination  V01
of  
the  
civilized  
world  <ARG0
against  
all  
three  
circles  <ARGM-GOL
of  
evil  
.  

Allow  V01
me  >>ARG1
,  
for  
a  
moment  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
to  
depart  V01
from  
my  
alleged  
role  <ARG1
as  
a  
taxi  
driver  
and  
return  V01
to  
science  <ARG4
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
malignant  
tumor  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
remove  V01
the  
tumor  <ARG1
itself  
surgically  <ARGM-MNR
.  

You  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-ADV
starve  V01
it  <ARG1
by  
preventing  V01
new  
blood  >ARG0
from  
reaching  V01
it  <ARG1
from  
other  
parts  <ARGM-DIR
of  
the  
body  
,  
thereby  >ARGM-ADV
preventing  V01
new  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
supplies  V01
"  
from  
expanding  V01
the  
tumor  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >>>ARG0
want  V01
to  
be  V01
sure  V01
,  
it  
is  V01
best  V02
to  
do  V02
both  <ARG1
.  

But  
before  
you  >>ARG0
fight  V01
and  
win  V01
,  
by  
force  <ARGM-MNR
or  
otherwise  
,  
you  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
realize  V01
that  
you  >ARG1
are  V01
in  
a  
war  V01
,  
and  
this  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
take  V10
Europe  <ARG2
a  
few  
more  
years  <ARG1
.  

In  
order  
to  
win  V01
,  
it  
is  V01
necessary  V02
to  
first  >ARGM-TMP
eliminate  V01
the  
terrorist  
regimes  <ARG1
,  
so  
that  
no  
Government  >ARG0
in  
the  
world  
will  >ARGM-MOD
serve  V01
as  
a  
safe  
haven  <ARG1
for  
these  
people  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
comment  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
on  
whether  
the  
American  
-  
led  >ARG0
attack  V01
on  
Iraq  <ARG1
was  V01
justified  V01
from  
the  
point  <ARGM-ADV
of  
view  V02
of  
weapons  
of  
mass  >ARGM-ADJ
destruction  V01
or  
any  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
pre-war  >ARGM-TMP
argument  V01
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
look  V01
at  
the  
post-war  
map  <ARG1
of  
Western  
Asia  
.  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
that  
Afghanistan  >ARG1
,  
Iraq  
and  
Libya  
are  V01
out  <ARG2
,  
two  
and  
a  
half  
terrorist  
states  >ARG1
remain  V01
:  
Iran  <C-ARG1
,  
Syria  
and  
Lebanon  
,  
the  
latter  >ARG1
being  V01
a  
Syrian  
colony  <ARG2
.  

Perhaps  >>ARGM-ADV
Sudan  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
added  V02
to  
the  
list  <ARG2
.  

As  
a  
result  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
conquest  
of  
Afghanistan  
and  
Iraq  
,  
both  
Iran  >>ARG2
and  
Syria  
are  V03
now  >ARGM-TMP
totally  >ARGM-EXT
surrounded  V01
by  
territories  <ARG1
unfriendly  
to  
them  
.  

Iran  >>ARG2
is  V03
encircled  V01
by  
Afghanistan  <ARG1
,  
by  
the  
Gulf  
States  <C-ARG1
,  
Iraq  
and  
the  
Moslem  
republics  
of  
the  
former  
Soviet  
Union  
.  

Syria  >>ARG2
is  V03
surrounded  V01
by  
Turkey  <ARG1
,  
Iraq  
,  
Jordan  
and  
Israel  
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
significant  >ARGM-EXT
strategic  >ARG1
change  V01
and  
it  >ARG0
applies  V02
strong  
pressure  <ARG1
on  
the  
terrorist  
countries  <ARG2
.  

It  
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
surprising  <ARG2
that  
Iran  >>ARG0
is  V01
so  >ARGM-EXT
active  V06
in  
trying  V01
to  
incite  V01
a  
Shiite  >ARG0
uprising  V03
in  
Iraq  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
if  
the  
American  >ARG0
plan  V01
was  V01
actually  <ARGM-ADV
to  
encircle  V01
both  
Iran  <ARG2
and  
Syria  
,  
but  
that  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
resulting  V01
situation  <ARG2
.  

In  
my  
humble  
opinion  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
number  
one  
danger  >ARG1
to  
the  
world  
today  >ARGM-TMP
is  V01
Iran  <ARG2
and  
its  
regime  
.  

It  >>>ARG0
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
has  V03
ambitions  <ARG1
to  
rule  V03
vast  
areas  <ARG1
and  
to  
expand  V01
in  
all  
directions  <ARGM-DIR
.  

It  >ARG0
has  V03
an  
ideology  >ARG0
which  >R-ARG0
claims  V01
supremacy  <ARG1
over  
Western  
culture  
.  

It  >>ARG1
is  V01
ruthless  V01
.  

It  >>ARG0
has  V01
proven  V01
that  
it  >>>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
execute  V02
elaborate  
terrorist  
acts  <ARG1
without  
leaving  V12
too  
many  
traces  <ARG1
,  
using  V01
Iranian  
Embassies  <ARG1
.  

It  >>>ARG0
is  V03
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
trying  V01
to  
develop  V02
nuclear  
weapons  <ARG1
.  

Its  
so  
-  
called  
moderates  >ARG0
and  
conservatives  
play  V01
their  
own  
virtuoso  
version  <ARG1
of  
the  
"  
good  
-  
cop  
versus  
bad  
-  
cop  
"  
game  
.  

Iran  >ARG0
sponsors  V01
Syrian  
terrorism  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
certainly  <ARGM-ADV
behind  
much  <ARG2
of  
the  
action  V02
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
,  
it  >>ARG0
is  V03
fully  >ARGM-EXT
funding  V01
the  
Hezbollah  <ARG1
and  
,  
through  
it  
,  
the  
Palestinian  
Hamas  
and  
Islamic  
Jihad  
;  
it  >ARG0
performed  V01
acts  <ARG1
of  
terror  
at  
least  
in  
Europe  <ARGM-LOC
and  
in  
South  
America  
and  
probably  
also  
in  
Uzbekistan  
and  
Saudi  
Arabia  
and  
it  >ARG0
truly  >ARGM-ADV
leads  V02
a  
multi-national  
terror  
consortium  >ARG2
,  
which  >R-ARG2
includes  V01
,  
as  
minor  
players  <ARGM-PRD
,  
Syria  <ARG1
,  
Lebanon  
and  
certain  
Shiite  
elements  
in  
Iraq  
.  

Nevertheless  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
most  
European  
countries  >>>ARG0
still  >>>ARGM-TMP
trade  V01
with  
Iran  <ARG2
,  
try  V01
to  
appease  V01
it  <ARG1
and  
refuse  V01
to  
read  V01
the  
clear  >ARGM-MNR
signals  V07
.  

In  
order  
to  
win  V01
the  
war  V01
it  
is  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
necessary  V02
to  
dry  <ARG1
the  
financial  
resources  
of  
the  
terror  
conglomerate  
.  

It  >>>ARG0
is  V01
pointless  V01
to  
try  V01
to  
understand  V01
the  
subtle  >ARGM-ADJ
differences  V02
between  
the  
Sunni  
terror  <ARG1
of  
Al  
Qaeda  
and  
Hamas  
and  
the  
Shiite  
terror  
of  
Hezbollah  
,  
Sadr  
and  
other  
Iranian  
-  
inspired  
enterprises  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG0
serves  V01
their  >ARG0
business  >ARG1
needs  V01
,  
all  >ARG0
of  
them  
collaborate  V01
beautifully  <ARGM-MNR
.  

It  >>ARG0
is  V01
crucial  <ARG2
to  
stop  V01
Saudi  >ARG0
and  
other  
financial  >ARGM-MNR
support  V01
of  
the  
outer  
circle  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
the  
fertile  
breeding  
ground  <ARG2
of  
terror  
.  

It  
is  V01
important  V01
to  
monitor  V01
all  
donations  V01
from  
the  
Western  
World  <ARG0
to  
Islamic  
organizations  <ARG2
,  
to  
monitor  V01
the  
finances  V01
of  
international  
relief  
organizations  <ARG1
and  
to  
react  V01
with  
forceful  >ARGM-ADJ
economic  >ARG1
measures  V02
to  
any  
small  >ARGM-ADJ
sign  V07
of  
financial  >ARGM-MNR
aid  V01
to  
any  <ARG2
of  
the  
three  
circles  
of  
terrorism  
.  

It  
is  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
important  V01
to  
act  V02
decisively  <ARGM-MNR
against  
the  
campaign  V01
of  
lies  V08
and  
fabrications  V01
and  
to  
monitor  V01
those  
Western  
media  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
collaborate  V01
with  
it  <ARG1
out  
of  
naivety  <ARGM-CAU
,  
financial  >ARG2
interests  V01
or  
ignorance  
.  

Above  
all  >ARGM-ADV
,  
never  >ARGM-NEG
surrender  V01
to  
terror  <ARG2
.  

No  
one  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
ever  >ARGM-TMP
know  V01
whether  
the  
recent  >ARGM-TMP
elections  V01
in  
Spain  <ARGM-LOC
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
yielded  V01
a  
different  
result  <ARG1
,  
if  
not  
for  
the  
train  >ARG1
bombings  V01
a  
few  
days  
earlier  <ARGM-TMP
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
it  >>ARG1
really  >>ARGM-ADV
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
matter  V01
.  

What  >ARG1
matters  V01
is  V01
that  
the  
terrorists  >ARG0
believe  V01
that  
they  >ARG0
caused  V01
the  
result  <ARG1
and  
that  
they  >ARG0
won  V01
by  
driving  V02
Spain  <ARG1
out  
of  
Iraq  <ARG2
.  

The  
Spanish  
story  >>ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
surely  >ARGM-ADV
end  V03
up  
being  V01
extremely  
costly  <ARG2
to  
other  
European  
countries  
,  
including  
France  >>>ARG0
,  
who  >>>R-ARG0
is  V03
now  >>>ARGM-TMP
expelling  V01
inciting  V01
preachers  <ARG0
and  
forbidding  V01
veils  <ARG1
and  
including  
others  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
sent  V01
troops  <ARG1
to  
Iraq  <ARG2
.  

In  
the  
long  >ARGM-ADJ
run  V13
,  
Spain  >ARG0
itself  
will  >ARGM-MOD
pay  V01
even  
more  <ARG1
.  

Is  V01
the  
solution  V01
a  
democratic  
Arab  
world  <<ARG2
?  

If  
by  
democracy  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
mean  V01
free  >ARGM-MNR
elections  V01
but  
also  
free  
press  
,  
free  >ARGM-ADJ
speech  V01
,  
a  
functioning  
judicial  
system  
,  
civil  
liberties  
,  
equality  
to  
women  
,  
free  >ARGM-ADJ
international  >ARG1
travel  V01
,  
exposure  V01
to  
international  
media  <ARG2
and  
ideas  
,  
laws  
against  
racial  >ARG0
incitement  V01
and  
against  
defamation  V01
,  
and  
avoidance  
of  
lawless  
behavior  
regarding  
hospitals  
,  
places  
of  
worship  
and  
children  
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
democracy  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
solution  V01
.  

If  
democracy  >ARG1
is  V01
just  <ARGM-ADV
free  >ARGM-MNR
elections  V01
,  
it  
is  V01
likely  V01
that  
the  
most  
fanatic  
regime  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
elected  V01
,  
the  
one  >>>ARG0
whose  >>ARG0
incitement  V01
and  
fabrications  V01
are  V01
the  
most  >ARGM-EXT
inflammatory  V01
.  

We  >>ARG0
have  V01
seen  V01
it  <ARG1
already  <ARGM-TMP
in  
Algeria  <ARGM-LOC
and  
,  
to  
a  
certain  
extent  
,  
in  
Turkey  
.  

It  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
happen  V01
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
if  
the  
ground  >>ARG1
is  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
prepared  V02
very  
carefully  <ARGM-MNR
.  

On  
the  
other  
hand  >ARGM-ADV
,  
a  
certain  
transition  
democracy  >>>ARG0
,  
as  
in  
Jordan  >ARGM-PRD
,  
may  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
better  >ARGM-ADJ
temporary  >ARGM-TMP
solution  V01
,  
paving  V02
the  
way  V01
for  
the  
real  
thing  <<ARG2
,  
perhaps  
in  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
that  >>>R-ARGM-MNR
an  
immediate  
sudden  
democracy  >>>ARG1
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
work  V09
in  
Russia  <ARGM-LOC
and  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
have  V01
worked  V09
in  
China  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  VLV
no  >ARGM-NEG
doubt  V01
that  
the  
civilized  
world  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
prevail  V01
.  

But  >>>ARGM-DIS
the  
longer  >ARG1
it  
takes  V10
us  <ARG2
to  
understand  V01
the  
new  
landscape  <ARG1
of  
this  
war  V01
,  
the  
more  
costly  >>ARG2
and  
painful  
the  
victory  V01
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
.

An

included  V01
a

by

that  
at  
a

in

,  
a  
report  V01
by  
a

2004  
,  
the

concluded  V01
that  
"  
Al

an

In  
a

the

noted  V01
that  
the

relate  V01
to  
a  
plot  V01
to  
disperse  V01
a  
chemical  
or  
biological  
weapon  <ARG1

The  
CIA  >>>ARG0
reportedly  >>>ARGM-ADV
has  V01
been  V03
quietly  >ARGM-MNR
building  V01
a  
case  V03
that  
the

an

theory  <ARG1
about

American

Many

argued  V01
that

behind  
the  
earlier  
Fall

the  
US

and  
that  
the  
mailings  >ARG0
served  V01
as  
a  
threat  <ARG1
and  
warning  V01
.  

Princeton  
islamist  
scholar  
Bernard  >>ARG0
Lewis  
has  V01
explained  V01
that  
while  
islamists  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
disagree  V01
about  
whether  
killing  V01
innocents  <ARG1

sanctioned  V01
by  
the

given  VLV

used  V01

Zawahiri  >>ARG1
was  V03
associated  V01
with  
a  
faction  >ARG1
of  
the  
Egyptian  
Islamic  
Jihad  
known  V01
as  
the  
Vanguards  <ARG2
of  
Conquest  
.  

Zawahiri  >>>ARG0
and  
the  
Vanguards  
of  
Conquest  
were  V03
seeking  V01
to  
recreate  V01
Mohammed  >ARG0
's  
taking  V01
of  
mecca  <ARG1
by  
a  
small  
band  <ARGM-MNR
through  
violent  >ARGM-MNR
attacks  V01
on  
Egyptian  
leaders  <ARG1
.  

By  
1998  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
Zawahiri  >>ARG0
had  V01
determined  V01
that  
the  
Egyptian  
Islamic  
Jihad  >>>ARG0
should  >>>ARGM-MOD
focus  V01
on  
its  >ARG0
struggle  V01
against  
the  
United  
States  <ARG1
and  
hold  V08
off  
on  
further  >ARGM-ADJ
attacks  V01
against  
the  
Egyptian  
regime  <ARG1
.  

A  
key  >ARGM-ADJ
question  V01
is  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
they  >ARG0
acquired  V01
the  
anthrax  
strain  >ARG1
first  >ARGM-TMP
isolated  V01
by  
the  
Texas  
Veterinary  
Medical  
Diagnostic  
Lab  <ARG0
in  
1980  <ARGM-TMP
.  

According  
to  
senior  
counter  
terrorism  
officials  >ARGM-ADV
,  
both  
here  
and  
abroad  
,  
among  
the  
supporters  >ARG2
of  
these  
militant  
islamists  
were  V01
people  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
blended  V01
into  
society  <ARG2
and  
were  V01
available  V02
to  
act  V02
when  >ARGM-TMP
another  
part  >ARG0
of  
the  
network  
requested  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

A  
few  
days  
before  
Christmas  >>>ARGM-TMP
2003  
,  
after  
a  
renewed  
audiotape  
threat  >>>ARGM-TMP
by  
Zawahiri  
of  
attacks  V01
,  
to  
include  V01
in  
the  
US  
homeland  <ARG2
,  
the  
threat  
level  >>ARG1
was  V03
raised  V01
to  
orange  <ARG4
or  
"  
high  
.  
"  

After  
the  
alert  
condition  >>ARG1
had  V01
long  
since  >ARGM-TMP
returned  V01
to  
yellow  <ARG4
,  
Zawahiri  >ARG0
in  
late  
February  >ARGM-TMP
issued  V01
another  
audiotape  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
urged  V01
the  
President  <ARG1
that  
brigades  >>>ARG0
and  
brigades  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
coming  V04
under  
the  
banner  <ARG2
of  
jihad  
carrying  V01
death  V01
and  
seeking  V01
paradise  <ARG1
.  

Zawahiri  >ARG0
said  V01
that  
the  
US  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
expect  V01
another  
9/11  <ARG1
on  
US  
soil  
.  

According  
to  
some  
reports  V01
,  
Zawahiri  >>>ARG1
is  V03
thought  V01
by  
intelligence  <ARG0
to  
be  V01
somewhere  <ARG2
near  
the  
border  
of  
Pakistan  
and  
Afghanistan  
.  

At  
one  
time  >ARGM-TMP
,  
some  >ARG0
thought  V01
he  >>>ARG1
had  V01
been  V03
spotted  V01
in  
Iran  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Wherever  >>ARGM-ADV
he  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
authorities  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
focus  V01
on  
the  
traceable  >ARGM-ADJ
connection  V01
between  
him  <ARG1
and  
those  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
or  
Atef  
recruited  V01
.  

In  
October  >>ARGM-TMP
2001  
,  
did  V01
the  
FBI  
profilers  >ARG0
know  V01
of  
the  
draft  
message  >>>ARG1
Khalid  >ARG0
Mohammed  
had  V03
on  
the  
seized  V01
laptop  <ARG1
(  
from  
1995  <<ARGM-TMP

that  >>R-ARG1

signed  V01

Khalid  
Sheik  
Bojinka  <ARG2

?  

The  
letter  >>ARG0
threatened  V01
to  
use  V01
biochemical  
weapons  <ARG1
if  
the  
blind  
sheik  >>ARG1
was  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
released  V01

(  
Khalid  >ARG1
Mohammed  
's  
involvement  V01
dates  V01
back  <ARG2

,  
as  
does  V01

.  

Use  V01
of  
biochemical  
weapons  <ARG1
as  
blackmail  <ARG2
and  
threatened  V01
retaliation  V01
for  
such  >ARGM-ADJ

was  V01
an  
alternative  
scenario  <ARG2
in  
the  
Bojinka  >ARG1

In  
May  >ARGM-TMP

Assistant  
Secretary  
for  
Information  
Analysis  
,  
Homeland  
Security  
Department  
testified  V01
before  
the  
9/11  
Commission  <ARGM-LOC
.  

He  >ARG0
explained  V01
that  
interrogations  V01
and  
other  
evidence  
revealed  V01
that  
Al

wanted  V01
to  
strike  V01
the  
US  <ARG1

a  
nonconventional  
weapon  <ARG2

most  
notably

received  V01
any  
briefing  V01
on  
the  
use  V01
of

,  
they  >>>ARG0
had  V01
taken  VLV
steps  V01
to  
prepare  V02
for  
an  
attack  V01
using  V01
anthrax  <ARG1
based  
on  
intelligence  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
had  V01
been  V03
received  V01
.  

Al

has  V01
had  V03
anthrax  <ARG1
,  
the  
raw  
seed  
product  
in  
its  
unweaponized  
form  
,  
since  
at  
least  
1997  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
when  >>R-ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
was  V03
purchased  V01
by  
Bin  <ARG0

through  
the  
Moro  
Islamic  
Liberation  
Front  <ARG2

,  
is  V01
head  <ARG2
of  
Al

's  
biochemical  
program  
.  

The  
CIA  >>ARG0
has  V01
known  V01
of  
Zawahiri  >ARG0
's  
plans  V01
to  
use  V01
anthrax  <ARG1
for  
a  
half  
decade  <<<ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
confidante  >ARG0
and  
right  
-  
hand  
man  
of  
Dr.  
Ayman  
Zawahiri  
admitted  V01
that  
Zawahiri  >>>ARG0
succeeded  V01
in  
obtaining  V01
anthrax  <ARG1
and  
intended  V01
to  
use  V01
it  <ARG1
against  
US  
targets  <ARGM-GOL
.  

Another  
senior  
Al

member  >>ARG0
(  
a  
shura  
or

-  
making

)  
was  V03
working  V01
for  
the  
Egyptian  >ARG1

services  V01
and  
he  >ARG0
confirmed  V01
the  
report  V01
in  
a  
sworn  >ARGM-PRD
lengthy  >ARGM-ADJ
confession  V01
.  

Even  
Zawahiri  
's  
attorney  >ARG0
in  
1999  >ARGM-TMP
said  V01
that  
Bin  >>>ARG0
Laden  
and  
Zawahiri  
were  V01
likely  V01
to  
resort  V01
to  
the  
biological  
and  
chemical  
agents  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
possessed  V01
given  
the

faced  V01
.  

A  
recently  
released  
islamist  >>>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG1
had  V01
been  V01
a  
close  
associate  <ARG2
of  
Zawahiri  
said  V01
that  
Zawahiri  >>>ARG0
spent  V02
a  
decade  <ARG1
and  
had  V01
made  VLV
15  
separate  >ARGM-ADJ
attempts  V01
to  
recruit  V01
the  
necessary  
expertise  <ARG1
to  
weaponize  V01
anthrax  <ARG1
in  
Russia  <ARGM-LOC
and  
the  
Middle  
East

obtaining  V01
the  
unprocessed

not  >ARGM-NEG
warrant  V01
the  
weight  >ARG1
given  V01
it  <ARG2
by  
some  
press  >ARG0
accounts  V01
.  

There  
was  V02
lax  >ARGM-ADJ
control  V01
over  
the  
distribution  V01
of  
the  
Ames  
strain  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
was  V03
used  V01
,  
especially  
in  
light  <<<ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
fact  
that

were  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV

a

at

a

can  >ARGM-MOD

rule  V02
out

under  
the  
optimal

Yazid  >>>ARG0
Sufaat  
provided  V01
Moussaoui  <ARG2
with  
a  
letter  >ARG0
indicating  V01
that  
he  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
marketing  
representative  <ARG2
for  
Infocus  
Technologies  
and  
allegedly  >ARGM-ADV
provided  V01
him  <ARG2
$  <ARG1
35,000  
.  

The  
crop  
dusters  >>ARG1
were  V01
to  
be  V01
part  <ARG2
of  
a  
"  
second  >ARGM-ADJ
wave  V04
.  
"  

After  
9/11  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Yazid  >>>ARG0
Sufaat  
traveled  V01
to  
Afghanistan  <ARG1
and  
Pakistan  
to  
work  V01
for  
the  
Taliban  
Medical  
Brigade  <ARG2
and  
to  
continue  V01
his  >ARG0
work  V01
with  
anthrax  <ARG1
.  

As  
described  V01
in  
US  
News  <ARGM-LOC
,  
a  
former  
reporter  >>>ARG0
from  
the  
Kabul  
Times  
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
met  V02
Sufaat  <ARG1
,  
without  
realizing  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
while  
traveling  V01
near  
Kabul  <ARG1
in  
October  <ARGM-TMP
2001  
,  
perceiving  V01
him  <ARG1
as  
Filipino  <ARG2
.  

The  
fellow  >>>ARG0
was  V03
carrying  V01
papers  <ARG1
from  
Zawahiri  
and  
bragging  V01
about  
his  
ability  <ARG1
to  
manipulate  V01
anthrax  <ARG1
.  

Sufaat  >>ARG1
was  V03
arrested  V01
in  
December  <ARGM-TMP
2001  
upon  
his  >ARG1
return  V01
to  
Malaysia  <ARG4
.  

Newsweek  >ARG0
reported  V01
that  
a  
"  
second  >ARGM-ADJ
wave  V04
"  
involving  V01
biological  >ARGM-MNR
attacks  V01
had  V01
been  V03
thwarted  V01
upon  
the  
arrest  V01
of  
Al  
Qaeda  
members  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
had  V01
been  V03
intended  V01
to  
provide  V01
logistical  >ARG1
support  V01
.  

Various  
doctors  >>ARG1
,  
both  
foreign  
and  
American  
,  
are  V03
associated  V01
with  
Al  
Qaeda  
leaders  <ARG2
or  
operatives  
,  
to  
include  V01
the  
doctors  <ARG1
Abdul  
Qadoos  
Khan  
,  
a  
bacteriologist  
from  
Rawalpindi  
and  
Aafia  
Siddiqui  
,  
PhD  
,  
from  
Karachi  
.  

Microbiologist  
Abdul  >>ARG1
Qadoos  
Khan  
was  V03
charged  V05
along  
with  
his  
son  <ARGM-COM
,  
Ahmed  
,  
for  
harboring  V01
the  
fugitives  <ARG1
.  

As  
of  
March  >>>ARGM-TMP
28  
,  
2003  
,  
he  >>>ARG2
was  V01
in  
a  
hospital  <ARG2
for  
a  
cardiac  
problem  <ARGM-CAU
and  
had  V01
been  V03
granted  V01
"  
pre-arrest  
bail  <ARG1
.  
"  

Yet  >>ARGM-DIS
all  >>ARG1
you  >ARG0
read  V01
about  <C-ARG3
at  
the  
time  <ARGM-TMP
was  V01
the  
arrest  V01
of  
the  
son  >ARG0
Ahmed  
Abdul  
Qadoos  
,  
who  >R-ARG0
receives  V01
a  
stipend  <ARG1
from  
the  
UN  <ARG2
for  
being  V01
officially  >ARGM-ADV
low  V04
-  
IQ  <ARG2
due  
to  
lead  >ARG2
poisoning  V01
.  

It  
was  V01
Khalid  >ARG0
Mohammed  
who  >R-ARG0
told  V01
authorities  <ARG2
about  
Aafia  >ARG0
Siddiqui  
,  
who  >R-ARG0
has  V03
a  
PhD  <ARG1
from  
Brandeis  
in  
neurology  
.  

The  
Pakistani  
press  >ARG0
reported  V01
that  
she  >>ARG1
was  V03
nabbed  V01
in  
Karachi  <ARG2
after  
being  V03
spotted  V01
at  
the  
airport  <ARGM-LOC
in  
late  
March  <ARGM-TMP
or  
early  
April  
2003  
.  

If  
mistaken  
,  
how  >>>ARGM-MNR
did  V01
those  
reports  V01
first  >ARGM-TMP
come  V06
about  
?  

Understandably  >ARGM-DIS
,  
Amerithrax  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
confidential  >ARGM-ADJ
investigation  V01
.  

The  
Pakistan  
ISI  >ARG0
and  
CIA  
rarely  >ARGM-TMP
grant  V01
press  >ARG0
interviews  V01
in  
connection  V01
with  
an  
ongoing  
manhunt  <ARG2
.  

The  
CIA  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
allow  V01
the  
FBI  <ARG1
access  V01
to  
KSM  <ARG1
for  
10  
days  <<ARGM-TMP
after  
his  >ARG1
arrest  V01
.  

As  
agent  
Van  >>ARG0
Harp  
,  
then  
head  
of  
the  
Amerithrax  >ARG1
investigation  V01
said  V01
,  
the  
information  >>ARG1
coming  V01
from  
Khalid  <ARG3
Mohammed  
is  V01
classified  <ARG2
with  
the  
authorities  >ARG0
releasing  V01
only  
certain  
limited  
information  <ARG1
.  

While  
it  
's  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
easy  V05
to  
separate  V01
fact  <ARG1
from  
fiction  <ARG2
,  
Attorney  
General  
Ashcroft  >>ARG0
and  
Director  
Mueller  
have  V01
publicly  >ARGM-MNR
confirmed  V01
Aafia  >>>ARG1
is  V03
still  >>ARGM-TMP
being  V03
sought  V01
.  

They  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
know  V01
.  

Her  
mother  >ARG0
Ismat  
last  >ARGM-TMP
saw  V01
Aafia  <ARG1
and  
her  
grandchildren  
before  
they  >ARG0
left  V11
in  
a  
minicab  <ARGM-MNR
at  
the  
end  V01
of  
March  <ARG1
.  

Aafia  >ARG1
was  V01
on  
her  >ARG0
way  V01
with  
her  
children  <<ARGM-COM
to  
visit  V01
and  
uncle  <ARG1
and  
a  
friend  
in  
Islamabad  
.  

According  
to  
the  
Pakistan  >ARG0
reports  V01
,  
Aafia  >>ARG1
Siddiqui  
was  V03
detained  V01
after  
being  V03
spotted  V01
at  
Karachi  
International  
airport  <ARGM-LOC
(  
after  
she  >>ARG2
was  V03
followed  V01
to  
a  
relative  
's  
house  <ARGM-DIR
)  
.  

(  
Karachi  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
the  
south  <ARG2
)  
.  

The  
reports  V01
say  V01
she  >>ARG2
is  V03
suspected  V01
of  
having  V01
been  V01
a  
member  <ARG2
of  
Al  
Qaeda  
's  
"  
Chemical  
Wire  
Group  
.  
"  

The  
family  
's  
lawyer  >ARG0
advises  V01
me  <ARG1
that  
Aafia  >>>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
enough  
money  <ARG1
to  
pay  V01
for  
airfare  
tickets  <ARG3
for  
herself  
and  
the  
kids  
and  
called  V02
Ismat  <ARG1
from  
the  
train  
station  <ARGM-DIR
.  

That  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
last  >ARG1
Ismat  >ARG0
heard  V01
from  
her  <ARG2
.  

Aafia  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
reached  V01
the  
uncle  
's  
house  <ARG1
.  

Perhaps  >ARGM-ADV
something  >ARG1
got  V03
lost  <ARG2
in  
the  
translation  V01
,  
but  
the  
phrase  >>ARG1
"  
Chemical  
Wire  
Group  
"  
has  V01
appeared  V01
in  
all  
the  
english  
Pakistan  
and  
India  
papers  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
family  
's  
attorney  >ARG0
advises  V01
me  <ARG1
that  
Aafia  >ARG0
had  V03
no  
knowledge  <ARG1
of  
chemicals  
(  
and  
that  >>ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
appear  V02
to  
be  V01
her  >ARG2
training  V01
)  
.  

There  
still  >ARGM-TMP
is  V02
a  
very  
hot  >ARGM-ADJ
pursuit  V01
of  
the  
"  
Atta  
-  
level  
"  
Floridian  >>>ARG1
,  
Adnan  
El  
Shukrijumah  
,  
who  >>>R-ARG1
Siddiqui  >>>ARG0
is  V03
thought  V01
to  
have  V01
known  V02
and  
been  V03
assisting  V01
.  

His  
nickname  >ARG1
is  V01
"  
Jafar  <ARG2
the  
Pilot  
.  
"  

A  
senior  
DOJ  
official  >ARG0
reports  V01
that  
Adnan  >>ARG0
has  VLV
experience  V01
as  
a  
commercial  
pilot  <ARGM-PRD
.  

He  >>>ARG0
is  V03
said  V01
by  
one  
FBI  
agent  <ARG0
to  
be  V01
"  
very  
,  
very  
,  
very  >ARGM-EXT
"  
dangerous  V01
.  

He  >ARG1
allegedly  >ARGM-ADV
was  V01
at  
one  
or  
more  
meetings  V03
in  
the  
Summer  <ARGM-TMP
of  
2001  
in  
Pakistan  <ARGM-LOC
at  
which  >>R-ARG2
KSM  >>ARG1
and  
Sufaat  
were  V01
present  V02
.  

He  >>>ARG1
may  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V03
seen  V01
in  
Hamilton  <ARGM-LOC
,  
Canada  
--  
along  
with  
Egyptian  
al  >>ARG0
-  
Maati  
,  
who  >>R-ARG0
apparently  >>ARGM-MNR
also  >>ARGM-DIS
has  V01
received  V01
pilot  >ARG2
training  V01
.  

The  
United  
States  >ARG0
truly  >ARGM-ADV
no  
longer  >ARGM-NEG
has  V03
time  <ARG1
for  
faulty  >ARGM-ADJ
analysis  V01
or  
politically  >ARG2
-  
based  V02
preconceptions  V01
.  

In  
early  
June  >>ARGM-TMP
2003  
,  
a  
CIA  >ARG0
report  V01
concluded  V01
that  
the  
reason  >>ARG1
for  
Atta  >ARG0
's  
and  
Zacarias  
Moussaoui  
's  
inquiries  V01
into  
cropdusters  <ARG1
was  V01
in  
fact  <ARGM-ADV
for  
the  
contemplated  >ARGM-PRD
use  V01
in  
dispersing  V01
biological  
agents  <ARG1
such  
as  
anthrax  
.  

It  
has  V01
long  >>ARGM-TMP
been  V03
known  V01
Osama  >>ARG1
Bin  
Laden  
was  V01
interested  V01
in  
using  V01
cropdusters  >ARG0
to  
disperse  V01
biological  
agents  <ARG1
(  
since  
the  
testimony  V01
of  
millennium  
bomber  
Ahmed  <ARG0
Ressam  
)  
.  

The  
hijacker  >>>ARG1
Ahmed  
Alhaznawi  
appears  V02
to  
have  V01
contracted  V04
cutaneous  
anthrax  <ARG2
in  
Afghanistan  <ARGM-LOC
.  

It  
is  V01
reasonable  V02
to  
credit  V01
his  >ARG0
statement  V01
that  
he  >>ARG0
got  V01
the  
lesion  <ARG1
after  
bumping  V01
into  
a  
suitcase  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
was  V03
carrying  V01
at  
a  
camp  <ARGM-LOC
in  
Afghanistan  
.  

The  
lesion  >ARG1
is  V01
further  
evidence  <ARG2
of  
Al  
Qaeda  
's  
anthrax  >ARG1
production  V01
program  
at  
Kandahar  
.  

The  
present  
evidence  >>>ARG0
relating  V01
to  
Atta  >ARG0
's  
alleged  >ARGM-ADJ
travel  V01
to  
Prague  <ARG1
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
warrant  V01
a  
conclusion  V01
that  
Al  
Qaeda  >ARG0
obtained  V01
the  
Ames  
strain  <ARG1
from  
Iraq  <ARG2
.  

Iraq  >ARG1
,  
however  >ARGM-DIS
,  
remains  V01
a  
possible  
source  <ARG3
of  
the  
Ames  
.  

Former  
Russian  
bioweaponeer  
Ken  >>ARG0
Alibek  
has  V01
said  V01
that  
a  
key  
Russian  
scientist  >ARG0
assisted  V01
Iraq  <ARG1
and  
that  
Russia  >ARG0
had  V03
the  
Ames  
strain  <ARG1
.  

(  
His  >ARG0
conclusion  V01
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V01
based  
on  
the  
fake  >ARGM-ADJ
mobile  
biolab  >ARG1
plans  V01
foisted  V01
upon  
the  
US  <ARG2
by  
the  
Chalabi  <ARG0
associate  
"  
Curveball  
"  
,  
which  >>>R-ARG1
Alibek  >ARG0
divined  V01
to  
be  V01
identical  V01
to  
Russian  >ARG0
mobile  
lab  >ARG1
design  V01
)

Zawahiri  >>>ARG0
did  V01
travel  V01
to  
Baghdad  <ARG1
in  
1998  <ARGM-TMP
with  
an  
entourage  <ARGM-COM
to  
attend  V01
the  
birthday  >ARGM-ADJ
party  V01
of  
Saddam  
's  
son  
.  

The  
papers  >>ARG0
found  V01
at  
headquarters  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
Mukhabarat  
,  
Iraq  
's  
secret  
police  
,  
show  V01
that  
an  
entourage  >>ARG1
from  
Al  
Qaeda  
group  
was  V03
sent  V01
to  
the  
Iraqi  
capital  <ARG2
in  
March  <ARGM-TMP
1998  
from  
Sudan  <ARGM-DIR
.  

According  
to  
at  
least  
some  
reports  V01
,  
Bin  >>>ARG0
Laden  
rejected  V01
the  
suggestion  V01
of  
a  
closer  
alliance  <ARG1
--  
preferring  V01
to  
pursue  V01
his  
own  
concept  <ARG1
of  
jihad  
.  

Two  
top  
Iraqi  
scientists  >>>ARG0
,  
code  
named  V01
Charlie  <ARG2
and  
Alpha  
,  
are  V03
helping  V01
the  
coalition  >ARG0
to  
learn  V01
more  <ARGM-EXT
about  
Iraqi  
's  
anthrax  
program  <ARG1
,  
according  
to  
Dr.  <<ARGM-ADV
David  
Kay  
,  
head  
of  
the  
Iraq  
survey  
group  
in  
charge  V08
of  
the  
hunt  <ARG2
for  
WMD  
.  

He  >>ARG0
has  V01
said  V01
that  
the  
Iraqis  >>ARG0
made  VLV
surprising  >ARGM-ADJ
innovations  V01
in  
the  
milling  V01
and  
drying  
processes  V02
needed  V01
to  
weaponize  V01
anthrax  <ARG1
.  

The  
media  >ARG0
coverage  V03
has  V01
been  V01
seriously  >ARGM-EXT
confused  V01
on  
the  
issue  V02
of  
motive  <ARG0
and  
the  
reason  >>>ARGM-CAU
Senators  >>>ARG1
Daschle  
and  
Leahy  
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V03
targeted  V01
--  
tending  V02
to  
simplistically  >ARGM-MNR
view  V02
them  <ARG1
as  
"  
liberals  <ARG2
.  
"  

Zawahiri  >ARG0
likely  >ARGM-ADV
targeted  V01
Senators  >ARG0
Daschle  
and  
Leahy  
to  
receive  V01
anthrax  
letters  <ARG1
,  
in  
addition  V02
to  
various  
media  
outlets  <ARG2
,  
because  
of  
the  
appropriations  V01
made  VLV
pursuant  
to  
the  
"  
Leahy  
Law  
"  
to  
military  
and  
security  
forces  
.  

That  
money  >>ARG0
has  V01
prevented  V01
the  
militant  
islamists  >ARG0
from  
achieving  V01
their  
goals  <ARG1
.  

Al  
Qaeda  
members  >ARG0
and  
sympathizers  
feel  V02
that  
the  
FBI  >ARG1
's  
involvement  V01
in  
countries  <ARG2
like  
Egypt  
,  
Saudi  
Arabia  
,  
Pakistan  
,  
Indonesia  
,  
and  
the  
Philippines  
interferes  V01
with  
the  
sovereignty  <ARG1
of  
those  
countries  
.  

According  
to  
a  
post  V01
she  <ARG0
made  VLV
on  
the  
internet  <<ARG2
,  
Aafia  >ARG0
Siddiqui  
expressed  V01
the  
same  
sentiment  <ARG1
in  
connection  V01
with  
US  >ARG0
appropriations  V01
sought  V01
in  
exchange  V01
for  
the  
extradition  <ARG3
of  
WTC  
1993  
plotter  
Ramzi  
Yousef  
from  
Pakistan  
.  

Senator  >ARG1
Leahy  
was  V01
Chairman  <ARG2
of  
both  
the  
Judiciary  
Committee  >ARG0
overseeing  V01
the  
FBI  <ARG1
and  
Appropriations  
Subcommittee  
in  
charge  V08
of  
foreign  >ARGM-ADJ
aid  V01
to  
these  
countries  <ARG2
.  

In  
late  
September  >>ARGM-TMP
2001  
,  
it  >>ARG1
was  V03
announced  V01
that  
the  
President  >>ARG0
was  V03
seeking  V01
a  
blanket  
waiver  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD

all  
restrictions  V01

the

,  
remains  V01
foremost  <ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
mind  <ARG3
of  
Dr.  
Zawahiri  
.  

At  
the  
height  >>>ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
development  V02
of  
his  
biological  
weapons  
program  <ARG1
,  
his

.  

It  
's  V01
hard  V02
to  
keep  V05
up  
with  
the  
stories  <ARG1
about  
billion

appropriations  V01
,  
debt

Those

pale  V02
in

to  
the  
many

of  
billions  
in  
appropriations  V01
relating  V01
to  
the

Al

had  V03
a  
motive  <ARG1
in  
mind  <ARGM-ADV
.  

In  
his  
Fall  
2001  
book  >>ARGM-LOC
titled  V01
Knights  <ARG2
under  
the  
Banner  
of  
the  
Prophet  
,  
Zawahiri  >>>ARG0
argued  V01
that  
the  
secular  
press  >>ARG0
was  V03
telling  V01
"  
lies  V08
"  
about  
the  
militant  
islamists  <ARG3
--  
to  
include  V01
the  
suggestion  V01
that  
the  
militant  
islamists  >>ARG1
were  V01
somehow  >ARGM-ADV
the  
creation  V01
of  
the  
United  
States  <ARG0
in  
connection  V01
with  
expelling  V01
the  
Russians  <ARG1
from  
Afghanistan  <ARG2
.  

Zawahiri  >ARG0
argued  V01
instead  <ARGM-ADV
that  
they  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V01
active  V06
since  
the  
assassination  V01
of  
Anwar  <ARG1
Sadat  
in  
Egypt  <ARGM-LOC
because  
of  
the  
Camp  
David  
Accord  <ARGM-CAU
and  
the  
resulting  V01
peace  
treaty  <ARG2
between  
Egypt  
and  
Israel  
.  

The  
anthrax  
letters  >>ARG1
were  V03
sent  V01
on  
the  
date  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
Camp  
David  
Accord  
and  
then  
the  
date  >>ARGM-TMP
Anwar  >>ARG1
Sadat  
was  V03
assassinated  V01
as  
if  
to  
underscore  V01
the  
point  <ARG1
to  
anyone  >>ARG0
paying  VLV
attention  V02
.  

Most  >>>ARG0
of  
the  
"  
talking  
heads

,  
however  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
knew  V01
only  <ARGM-ADV
that  
Daschle  >ARG1
and  
Leahy  
were  V01
liberal  
democrats  <ARG2
and  
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG

anything  <ARG1

beyond  
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
read  V01
in  
the  
US  
newspapers  <ARGM-LOC

supporter  <ARG1
of

that  
an  
"  
either

approach  V02
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
useful  V05
.  

The  
media  >>>ARG0
has  V01
tended  V02
to  
overlook  V01
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
FBI  >ARG0
uses  V01
the  
word  <ARG1
"  
domestic  
"  
the

There  
is  V02
an

New

leader  <ARG2
of

The  
letter  
bombs  >>ARG1

with  
the

the  
letter  
bombs  >ARG1
--  
which  >R-ARG1
resulted  V01
in  
minimal

to  
Leavenworth  >>ARGM-LOC

Abdel

captured  V01
in  
Quetta  <ARGM-LOC
,  
Pakistan  
in  
mid-February  <ARGM-TMP
2003  
.  

That  
arrest  V01
in  
turn  >ARGM-ADV
led  V03
to  
the  
dramatic  >ARGM-ADJ
capture  V01
of  
Khalid  <ARG1
Mohammed  
,  
Al

's

Mohammed  >>ARG0

in  
the  
home  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
Pakistani  
bacteriologist  
Dr.

Along  
with  
Zawahiri  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
Abdel  >>>ARG0
Rahman  
and  
his  
two  
sons  
have  V01
had  VLV
considerable  >ARGM-EXT
influence  V01
over

.  

He  >ARG0
reportedly  >ARGM-ADV
treated  V01
them  <ARG1
like  
sons  <ARG2
.  

Although  
while  
in  
jail  >ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
early  
1980s  
,  
Zawahiri  >>>ARG0
caused  V01
considerable  >ARGM-EXT
tension  V01
by  
challenging  V01
the  
blind  
sheik  >ARG0
's  
ability  <ARG1
to  
lead  V02
a  
coalition  <ARG1

WTC  
1993  
plotter  >ARG1
Yousef  
was  V01
KSM  
's  
nephew  <ARG2

Thus  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
leaders  >>>ARG1
in  
charge  V08
of  
Al

's  
anthrax  >ARG1

According  
to  
the

seldom  >ARGM-TMP
reported  V01
,  
there  
is  V02
a  
wealth  <ARG1
of  
"  
open  
source  
"  
information  
about  
possible  
Al  
Qaeda  
or  
Egyptian  
Islamic  
Jihad  
or  
Egyptian  
Islamic  
Group  
in  
the  
United  
States  <ARGM-LOC
and  
Canada  
.  

The  
public  
information  >ARG1
mostly  >ARGM-ADV
relates  V01
to  
those  
suspected  
sleepers  >>>ARG1
who  >>>R-ARG1
have  V01
been  V03
detained  V01
or  
who  >>>R-ARG1
are  V01
at  
large  <ARG2
and  
are  V03
being  V03
sought  V01
.  

Zawahiri  >ARG0
's  
mission  V01
in  
the  
United  
States  <ARGM-LOC
in  
1995  <ARGM-TMP
was  V01
to  
do  V02
spadework  <ARG1
for  
terrorism  <ARG2
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
fundraising  V04
for  
charitable  
causes  <ARG2
.  

He  >>>ARG1
traveled  V01
under  
an  
alias  <ARGM-MNR
and  
was  V03
accompanied  V01
by  
a  
former  
US  
Army  
sergeant  >ARG1
named  V01
Ali  <ARG2
Mohammed  
.  

What  
mosques  >>ARG1
exactly  
did  V01
they  >ARG0
visit  V01
and  
who  >>ARG1
did  V01
they  >ARG0
meet  V03
?  

Whatever  >ARGM-ADV
your  
political  
persuasion  
,  
the  
FBI  >ARG0
and  
CIA  
deserve  V01
our  >ARG0
support  V01
.  

We  >ARG1
are  V01
,  
after  
all  <ARGM-ADV
,  
in  
this  <ARG2
together  <ARGM-ADV
.  

First  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
nature  >>ARG1
of  
such  
an  
investigation  V01
is  V01
that  
we  >ARG0
lack  V01
sufficient  
information  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
second  >ARGM-TMP
-  
guess  V01
(  
or  
even  >ARGM-ADV
know  V01
)  
what  >>ARG1
the  
FBI  >>ARG0
is  V03
doing  V02
.  

Media  >ARG0
reports  V01
are  V01
a  
poor  >ARGM-ADJ
approximation  V01
of  
reality  <ARG1
because  
of  
the  
lack  V01
of  
good  
sources  <ARG1
.  

Second  >ARGM-TMP
,  
hindsight  >ARG1
is  V01
20  
/  
20  <ARG2
.  

Third  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
with  
the  
"  
new  
age  
"  
Efrem  
Zimbalist  
,  
Jr.  
in  
charge  V08
of  
the  
investigation  V01
,  
it  
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
likely  V01
we  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
better  <ARGM-MNR
in  
striking  V05
the  
appropriate  
balance  <ARG1
between  
due  >ARGM-ADJ
process  V02
and  
national  
security  
.  

Finally  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
"  
Hatfill  >>>ARG0
theory  
"  
seems  V01
to  
have  V01
been  V03
exhausted  V01
or  
at  >ARGM-ADV
least  
lost  V02
public  
favor  <ARG1
.  

The  
"  
Hatfill  >>>ARG1
theory  
"  
accusing  V01
Dr.  <ARG1
Stephen  
Hatfill  
was  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
highly  >ARGM-EXT
dubious  V02
.  

The  
suspicion  V01
was  V03
founded  V01
on  
many  
false  
premises  <ARG2
,  
and  
there  
was  V02
no  
reliable  
publicly  
known  
evidence  >ARG0
indicating  V01
his  
guilt  <ARG1
.  

The  
FBI  >ARG0
's  
fixation  V01
on  
Hatfill  <ARG2
(  
at  
least  
as  
rumored  V01
by  
some  
reporters  <ARG0
)  
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
stemmed  V01
from  
a  
warning  V01
by  
one  
Senator  <ARG0
that  
careers  >ARG1
hung  V01
in  
the  
balance  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Leahy  
's  
chief  >ARG0
of  
staff  
apparently  >ARGM-ADV
started  V01
with  
the  
strong  >ARGM-ADJ
predisposition  V01
that  
some  
right  
-  
winger  >>ARG1
was  V01
involved  V01
because  
two  
liberal  
democrats  >>>ARG1
had  V01
been  V03
targeted  V01
.  

The  
Hatfill  >>>ARG1
theory  
--  
to  
include  V01
ongoing  >ARGM-TMP
interviews  V01
and  
ongoing  
7  
/  
24  
surveillance  
by  
8  
surveillance  
specialists  
--  
is  V01
now  <ARGM-TMP
the  
subject  <ARG2
of  
pending  >>>ARGM-ADJ
civil  >ARGM-ADJ
rights  V05
and  
libel  V01
claims  V01
of  
uncertain  
merit  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

A  
suit  >>ARG1
against  
the  
New  
York  
Times  
and  
columnist  
Nicholas  
Kristof  
was  V03
dismissed  V01
in  
late  
November  <ARGM-TMP
2004  
.  

The  
judge  >>>ARG0
had  V01
agreed  V01
to  
delay  V01
the  
civil  >ARGM-ADJ
rights  V05
matter  <<ARG1
from  
proceeding  V01
until  
at  
least  
October  <<<ARGM-TMP
2004  
.  

The  
judge  >>>ARG0
,  
frustrated  V01
by  
the  
apparent  >ARGM-ADJ
lack  V01
of  
progress  V01
,  
encouraged  V02
that  
the  
parties  >ARG0
reach  V01
a  
negotiated  >ARGM-PRD
compromise  V01
that  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
permit  V01
some  
limited  >ARGM-ADJ
discovery  V01
to  
proceed  V01
(  
and  
the  
judge  >>ARG0
has  V01
directed  V01
that  
the  
government  >ARG0
to  
file  V01
an  
Answer  V01
to  
the  
Complaint  V01
)  
.  

The  
Hatfill  
Theory  >>ARG1
ironically  >>ARGM-ADV
might  >>ARGM-MOD
best  >>ARGM-EXT
be  V03
understood  V01
as  
an  
Al  
Qaeda  
theory  <ARG2
,  
with  
a  
coincidental  >ARGM-ADJ
Malaysian  >ARG1
connection  V01
adding  V02
to  
the  
other  
circumstances  <ARG2
.  

Given  
the  
regrettable  >ARGM-ADJ
leaks  V01
that  
he  >ARG1
was  V01
under  
suspicion  V01
,  
it  
is  V01
only  >ARGM-ADV
fair  V01
that  
the  
FBI  >ARG0
leak  V01
with  
equal  
enthusiasm  <ARGM-MNR
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
Dr.  >>>ARG1
Hatfill  
has  V01
now  >>ARGM-TMP
been  V03
dropped  V05
as  
a  
suspect  <ARGM-PRD
if  
and  
when  >ARGM-TMP
that  >>ARG1
proves  V01
to  
be  V01
the  
case  V04
.  

A  
search  V01
of  
Dr.  >ARG0
Ken  
Berry  
's  
residences  V01
likely  >ARGM-ADV
will  >ARGM-MOD
prove  V01
just  
about  
the  
last  
gasp  <ARG1
of  
a  
biodefense  
insider  
theory  
.  

Senior  
officials  >>>ARG2
have  V01
been  V03
quoted  V01
in  
the  
press  <ARGM-LOC
as  
saying  V01
that  
the  
searches  V01
were  V01
for  
the  
purpose  <ARG2
of  
excluding  V01
him  <ARG1
as  
much  <<ARGM-ADV
as  
including  V01
him  <ARG1
.  

Maureen  
,  

Andre  >>>ARG0
is  V03
going  V04
to  
look  V06
over  V_
the  
list  <ARG1
of  
curves  >ARG1
needed  V01
for  
the  
global  
assets  <ARGM-PRP
(  
August  >ARGM-TMP
Board  >ARG0
meeting  V03
)  
one  
more  
time  <<<ARGM-TMP
before  
I  >ARG0
forward  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
you  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
make  V02
sure  V01
that  
we  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
request  V01
FX  
and  
inflation  V01
(  
CPI  
,  
PPI  
,  
etc.  
)  
curves  <<ARG1
when  >>ARGM-TMP
only  
one  >>ARG1
of  
the  
curves  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V03
used  V01
in  
the  
valuation  >ARG1
process  V02
and  
to  
determine  V01
which  
inflation  
index  >>ARG1
is  V03
needed  V01
.  

Typically  >ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >ARG0
receive  V01
both  
FX  <ARG1
and  
inflation  V01
from  
you  <<ARG2
,  
but  
both  
curves  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
always  >>ARGM-TMP
be  V03
used  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
hope  V01
that  
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
you  <ARG2
some  
time  
savings  <ARG1
by  
eliminating  V01
any  
nonessential  >ARGM-ADJ
requests  V01
.  

For  
now  >ARGM-TMP
,  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
list  <ARG2
of  
countries  
for  
which  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
need  V01
the  
FX  
and

or  
inflation  V01

FYI  

Vince  

Anne  >ARGM-DIS
,  
Mike  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
call  V02
you  <ARG1
regarding  
Sarah  <ARGM-PRP
.  

Vince  
,  

As  
I  >ARG0
mentioned  V01
in  
my  
voice  
mail  <ARGM-LOC
,  
Mike  >>ARG0
Roberts  
going  V04
to  
hire  V01
Sara  <ARG1
Woody  
,  
a  
recent  
MBA  
grad  
from  
Rice  
,  
into  
his  
group  <ARGM-GOL
.  

However  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG0
were  V03
talking  V01
about  
this  
position  <ARG1
,  
Mike  >ARG0
compared  V01
Sara  <ARG1
to  
Elena  <ARG2
.  

Elena  
's  
title  >ARG1
is  V01
admin  
coordinator  <ARG2
,  
and  
I  >>>ARG0
know  V01
that  
Sara  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
this  
title  <ARG1
,  
and  
honestly  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
that  
Elena  
should  <ARG1
also  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Admin  
coordinator's  >>ARG0
do  VLV
primarily  
administrative  >ARG1
work  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
suggest  V01
that  
you  >>ARG0
compare  V01
Elena  
and  
Sarah  
's  
duties  <ARG1
/  
level  
to  
other  
Sr.  
Spec.  <ARG2
in  
your  
group  
such  
as  
Kenneth  
Parkhill  
and  
Sevil  
to  
determine  V01
if  
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
equivalent  V01
,  
or  
if  
their  
scope  >>>ARG2
of  
responsibilities  
and  
experience  V01
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
as  >ARGM-EXT
broad  V02
.  

If  
the  
latter  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
case  >ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
place  V01
both  
Sara  <ARG1
and  
Elena  
in  
a  
specialist  
job  
group  <ARG2
(  
the  
salary  
range  >ARG1
is  V01
33  
-  
66  
K  <ARG2
)  
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
advise  V01
.

Anne  

Clayton

Michael  
:  

Thanks  V01
for  
putting  V03
the  
paperwork  <ARG1
together  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  VLV
interest  V01
in  
meeting  V03
if  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
present  V01
unique  
investment  
opportunities  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
I  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
have  VLV
access  V01
to  <C-ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Most  >>>ARG1
of  
my  >ARG0
contact  V01
with  
financial  
advisors  <ARG1
in  
the  
past  >>ARGM-TMP
has  V01
consisted  V01
of  
them  >>>ARG0
suggesting  V01
a  
mutual  
fund  <ARG1
,  
telling  V01
me  >ARG0
to  
invest  V01
in  
Home  
Depot  <ARG2
,  
Sun  
,  
and  
Coke  
,  
or  
trying  V01
to  
pass  V18
off  
their  
banks  >ARG0
'  
biased  >ARGM-ADJ
research  >ARG1
reports  V01
as  
something  <<ARG3
valuable  
.  

The  
above  >ARGM-ADJ
services  V01
provide  V01
no  
value  <ARG1
to  
me  <ARG2
personally  <ARGM-ADV
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
present  V01
opportunities  <ARG1
such  
as  
access  V01
to  
private  
equity  <ARG1
or  
hedge  
funds  
,  
or  
other  
ideas  
with  
strong  
growth  
potential  
and  
low  >ARGM-EXT
correlation  V01
to  
the  
S@P  <ARG2
,  
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
listen  V01
.

John  
-  

We  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
the  
paperwork  >ARG1
together  <ARG1
and  
sent  V01
to  
you  <ARG2
for  
naked  
options  <ARGM-PRP
.  

At  
some  
point  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
talk  V01
about  
the  
diversification  
strategy  <ARG1
in  
more  
detail  <ARGM-MNR
--  
perhaps  
over  
dinner  <ARGM-ADV
or  
a  
quick  >ARGM-ADJ
meeting  V03
after  
the  
markets  >ARG1
close  V01
?

Appreciate  V02
the  
idea  <ARG1
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
with  
my  
natural  
long  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
looking  V04
to  
really  >ARGM-ADV
trade  V01
around  
the  
position  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
believe  V01
ENE  >>>ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
continue  V01
to  
be  V01
range  >ARG2
bound  V01
,  
but  
in  
case  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
,  
I  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
forgo  V01
50  
%  <ARG1
of  
my  
option  
premium  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
price  
targets  
of  
where  >ARGM-LOC
I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
lighten  V02
up  
exposure  V01
to  
ENE  <ARG2
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
use  V01
calls  V03
to  
implement  V01
the  
stategy  <ARG1
.  

To  
that  
regards  V01
,  
I  >ARG0
noticed  V01
I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
approved  V01
to  
sell  V01
naked  >ARGM-ADJ
calls  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V01
that  
ability  <ARG1
in  
order  
to  
hedge  V01
some  
exposure  V01
I  <ARG1
have  VLV
of  
unexercised  
vested  
options  <<ARG2
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
look  V01
into  
that  <ARG1
for  
me  <ARGM-PRP
.  

John  
.  

John  
-  

I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
looking  V01
at  
the  
recent  
pullback  <ARG1
in  
ENE  
and  
thinking  V01
it  >ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
an  
opportunity  <ARG2
to  
buy  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
the  
calls  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
sold  V01
.  

Of  >ARGM-ADV
course  
,  
you  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
then  >ARGM-TMP
be  V01
in  
a  
position  >ARGM-ADV
to  
sell  V01
calls  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
if  
the  
stock  >>ARG1
makes  VLV
a  
bounce  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure  V02
that  
ENE  >ARG1
@  
75  
is  V01
the  
place  <ARG2
,  
but  
maybe  
@  
73  
.  

Call  V02
me  <ARG1
if  
you  >>ARG1
're  V01
interested  V01

all  <ARG1

the

this

appears  V02
to  
be  V01
a  
MTM

Per

this

then  >ARGM-TMP

no

83N  >ARG1
is  V01
my

I  >ARG0
think  V01
this

should  >ARGM-MOD
stay  V01
with  
83N  <ARG3

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
suggest  V01
it  >>ARG1
be  V03
assigned  V01

Virginia  
,  

Hello  
.  

I  >>ARG0
was  V03
originally  >ARGM-ADV
inquiring  V01
about  
purchasing  V01
a  
Cross  
or  
Signac  
impressionist  
lithograph  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
found  V01
them  <ARG1
and  
purchased  V01
both  <ARG1
from  
a  
gallery  <ARG2
in  
London  
,  
William  
Weston  
.  

They  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
delivered  V01
this  
week  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >>>ARG0
are  V01
beautiful  V02
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
add  V02
a  
lot  <ARG1
to  
our  >ARG0
collection  V01
.  

By  
the  
way  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
Lichtenstein  >>ARG1
is  V01
up  <ARG2
and  
hanging  V02
in  
our  
formal  
living  
room  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
magnificent  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
purchased  V01
an  
Appel  <ARG1
in  
the  
last  
month  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG1
am  V01
interested  V01
in  
several  
artists  <ARG2
.  

Actually  
,  
a  
lot  
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
looking  V01
for  
one  <ARG1
or  
more  
of  
the  
following  
.  

My  
concept  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
over  
time  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
own  V01
one  <ARG1
of  
all  
the  
following  
artists  
and  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
all  >ARGM-ADV
depending  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
find  V01
something  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
we  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-EXT
like  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
listed  V01
all  <ARG1
of  
our  
(  
sometimes  
mine  
vs.  
my  
wife  
's  
favorites  
and  
priorities  
)  
.  

They  >ARG1
are  V01
kind  <ARGM-ADV
of  
in  
rank  >ARG1
order  V03
but  
as  
I  >ARG0
stated  V01
if  
I  >ARG0
find  V01
the  
piece  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
like  V01
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
purchase  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
want  V01
signed  <ARG1
and  
numbered  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
realize  V01
that  
some  >>ARG1
were  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
signed  V01
by  
the  
artist  <ARG0
but  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
an  
important  
fact  <ARG2
in  
my  >ARG0
buying  >ARG1
decision  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
realize  V01
that  
some  >>>ARG0
may  >>>ARGM-MOD
not  >>>ARGM-NEG
have  V01
done  VLV
any  
works  V12
on  
paper  <ARGM-LOC
or  
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
outrageously  >ARGM-EXT
expensive  V02
.  

For  
example  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
know  V01
if  
Rothko  >>ARG0
or  
Kline  
did  VLV
any

By  
the  
way  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG1
am  V01
interested  V01
in  
re-looking  V01
at  
a  
Picasso  >>ARG1
(  
although  
we  >ARG0
have  V03
2  <ARG1
)  
that  >R-ARG1
your  
gallery  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
couple  
of  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
cubist  
piece  <ARG2
from  
the  
1920s  
and  
I  >ARG0
believe  V01
you  >ARG0
called  V01
the  
technique  <ARG1
a  
"  
push  
wa  <ARG2
"  
(  
pronunciation  V01
Vs  
an  
attempt  V01
at  
the  
proper  >ARGM-ADJ
spelling  V01
)  
.  

It  >>>ARG1
was  V01
for  
sale  V01
in  
a  
couple  <<ARGM-LOC
of  
galleries  
in  
SF  
and  
was  V01
about  
$  <ARG2
20,000  
.  

Is  V02
there  
1  <ARG1
available  
?  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
am  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
thinking  V01
about  
the  
Matisse  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
discussed  V01
before  <ARGM-TMP
but  
as  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
,  
I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
other  
artists  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG1
am  V01
interested  V01
in  <C-ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
remain  V01
on  
the  
back  
burner  <ARG3
because  
we  >ARG0
already  >ARGM-ADV
have  V03

On  
the  
issue  V02
of  
the  
contracts  <ARG0
,  
the  
draft  >ARG0
says  V01
that  
the  
$  >>ARG1
170  
m  
is  V03
paid  V01
when  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
EPC  
contract  >>ARG1
is  V03
signed  V02
.  

Are  V03
we  >ARG0
expecting  V01
that  
the  
portion  >>ARG1
attributable  
to  
each  
project  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
paid  V01
as  
the  
individual  
EPC  
contracts  >>ARG1
are  V03
signed  V02
?  

Thanks  V01
,  

Kay  

1  
.  
The  
pricing  V01
that  >>R-ARG1
we  >>ARG0
have  V01
given  V01
CRRA  <ARG2
is  V01
specific  <ARG2
to  
FuelCell  
Energy  
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
meaningful  <ARG2
without  
listing  V01
the  
manufacturer  <ARG1
(  
i.e.  >ARGM-ADV
,  
ONSI  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
lot  
more  
money  <ARG2
)  
.  

Hence  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
that  
we  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
reference  V04
the  
manufacturer  <ARG1
.  

2  
.  
The  
attachment  V01
of  
the  
Development  >ARG1
Agreement  V01
is  V01
a  
Jeff  >ARG2
question  V01
.  

In  
order  
to  
mark  V02
any  
2000  
income  <ARG1
,  
we  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
to  
get  V04
CRRA  >ARG0
to  
execute  V02
the  
Development  >ARG1
Agreement  V01
in  
2000  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

In  
my  
opinion  >ARGM-DIS
,  
we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
show  V01
CRRA  <ARG2
a  
copy  V01
of  
the  
LOI  <ARG1
with  
the  
assumption  V02
that  
the  
Development  >ARG1
Agreement  V01
is  V03
attached  V01
.  

I  >ARG0

the  
draft  >ARG1
Development  >ARG1
Agreement  V01
a  
couple  
days  
after  
the  
LOI  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Based  
on  
how  >ARGM-MNR
CRRA  >ARG0
reacts  V01
,  
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
make  VLV
an  
ultimate  >ARGM-ADJ
determination  V01
if  
the  
agreement  V01
needs  V01
to  
be  V03
attached  V01
to  
the  
LOI  <ARG2
.  

3  
.  
I  >ARG0
expect  V01
at  
least  
one  
EPC  
contract  <ARG1
per  
project  
.  

We  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
condition  V01
the  
acceptance  V01
of  
one  
project  <ARG1
on  
the  
performance  V02
of  
another  
project  <ARG1
.  

Performance  >ARG1
tests  V01
will  >>ARGM-MOD
either  
be  V03
performed  V01
on  
a  
project  
basis  <ARGM-MNR
or  
a  
unit  
by  
unit  
basis  
in  
a  
given  
project  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Remarkably  
clear  >ARGM-MNR
explanation  V01
.

Her

I  >ARG0
told  V01
Paul  <ARG2
that  
you  >ARG0
called  V02
him  <ARG1
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
so  
abruptly  <ARGM-ADV
because  
you  >>>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
waste  V01
his  
time  <ARG1
while  
you  >ARG0
got  V01
tests  V01
done  VLV
for  
arthritis  <<ARG1

I  >ARG0
told  V01
him  <ARG2
I  >ARG0
told  V01
you  >>ARG0
to  
call  V02
him  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR

at  >ARGM-ADV

hear  V01
what  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
has  V02
to  
say  V01
.  

He  >ARG0
said  V01
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
looking  V01
for  
people  <ARG1
and  
based  
on  
what  >>>ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
told  V01
him  <ARG2
an  
interview  V01
was  V01
a  
formality  <ARG2
.

Is  V01
that

I  >>ARG0

the

you  >ARG0

do  V02
that  <ARG1
?  

Chris  

Kathy  
,  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
take  V11
that  
deal  V01
out  <<C-V
until  
I  >ARG0
look  V01
at  
it  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
it  >ARG1
is  V01
mine  <ARG2
but  
I  >>ARG0
forgot  V01
to  
write  V01
it  <ARG1
in  
the  
blue  
FX  
book  <ARGM-LOC

I  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
wrote  V01
it  <ARG1

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
make  V02
Peters  >ARG1
and  
Co.  
wait  V01
.  

Chris  

I  >>ARG0

n't  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
a

to  
talk  V01
to

I  >ARG0

he  >ARG1

Give  VLV

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
pulled  V01
together  <ARG2
a

note  <ARG1
on  
our

We  >ARG1

in  
the  
final  
stages  <ARG2
of  
this

-  
where  >R-ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
draft  V01
a

which  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD

this  <ARG1
for  
inclusion  V01
within

(  
the  
Enron

)  

Have  V03
you  <ARG0
any

on  
draft

note  <ARG2

Late  
Jan  >>ARG1
sounds  V01
great  V01
.  

Meagan  >>ARG0
does  V01
have  V03
a  
couple  <ARG1
of  
big  
things  
on  
the  
weekend  <ARGM-TMP
in  
January  <ARGM-TMP
--  
National  
Charity  
League  
Senior  
Presentation  <C-ARG1
(  
big  >ARGM-ADJ
dance  V01
that  >>>R-ARG1
she  >>ARG1
and  
I  
are  V01
committed  V01
to  
help  V01
with  <C-ARG1
)  
,  
the  
Bearkadette  
Ball  
and  
a  
winter  >ARGM-TMP
party  V01
for  
Cotillion  <ARGM-GOL
.  

I  >ARG0
believe  V01
that  
these  >ARG1
are  V01
three  
weekends  <ARG2
in  
a  
row  
,  
January  
6  
,  
13  
and  
20th  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
the  
last  
weekend  >ARG1
in  
January  
would  >ARGM-MOD
work  V09
well  <ARGM-MNR
(  
and  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
a  
rest  V01
from  
formal  
affairs  <ARGM-ADJ
!  
)  
.  

Does  V01
that  >ARG1
work  V09
for  
you  <ARG2
?  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
do  V01
you  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
do  V02
it  <ARG1
on  
a  
Saturday  <ARGM-TMP
or  
Sunday  
?  

Saturday  >ARG1
probably  >ARGM-ADV
works  V09
better  <ARGM-ADV
for  
me  
,  
just  
so  
that  
I  >>ARG0
am  V01
back  <ARG2
in  
Houston  
and  
doing  V02
laundry  <ARG1
by  
Sunday  
afternoon  <ARGM-TMP
!!  

Hi  
...  

Talked  V01
to  
the  
little  
mother  
-  
to  
-  
be  <ARG2
.  

She  >ARG0
said  V01
a  
shower  V01
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
grand  <ARG2
.  

She  
has  VLV
some  
big  >ARGM-ADJ
presentation  V01
mid-January  
.  

How  >>ARG2
does  V01
late  
January  >ARG1
sound  V01
to  
you  <ARG3
.  

Should  >ARGM-MOD
we  >ARG0
set  V02
a  
date  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
?  

Am  V03
I  >ARG1
turning  V02
into  
Mother  <ARG2
?  

Cindy  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
that  
it  
is  V01
a  
great  
idea  <ARG2
to  
get  V01
some  
press  <ARG1
regarding  
our  
fundamental  
operating  
standards  
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
wonder  V01
about  
the  
most  
appropriate  >ARGM-ADJ
timing  V02
,  
enough  
of  
a  
global  
message  
and  
the  
means  
of  
delivery  V01
.  

On  
the  
means  >>>ARGM-ADV
of  
delivery  V01
,  
I  >>ARG0
am  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure  V02
from  
your  
note  <ARGM-DIR
whether  
or  
not  
I  >ARG0
fully  >ARGM-EXT
understand  V01
the  
intent  <ARG1
.  

Is  V02
there  
an  
article  >>ARG1
to  
be  V03
included  V01
in  
an  
Enron  >ARG0
publication  V01
and  
in  
addition  V02
a  
letter  >>ARG1
to  
be  V03
sent  V01
under  
John  
's  
name  <ARGM-MNR
(  
if  
so  
,  
to  
whom  >>ARG2
will  >>ARGM-MOD
the  
letter  >>ARG1
be  V03
sent  V01

?  

Or  
is  V01
the  
letter  <ARG1
from  
John  
an  
introduction  V02
to  
be  V03
included  V01
as  
a  
lead  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
to  
the  
article  <ARG4
?  

With  
regard  V01
to  
a  
global  
message  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
that  
one  >ARG1
of  
the  
key  
points  
around  
fundamental  
operating  
standards  
are  V01
that  
they  >>>ARG1
are  V03
intended  V01
to  
be  V01
global  <ARG2
in  
nature  <ARGM-MNR
,  
applied  V02
to  
every  
commodity  <ARG2
and  
every  
location  >ARGM-LOC
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
we  >ARG0
engage  V01
in  
trading  
activities  <ARG2
.  

With  >>ARGM-ADV
these  
operating  
standards  >ARG1
implemented  V01
worldwide  <ARGM-LOC
,  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
know  V01
as  
operations  
professionals  <ARG2
that  
risk  V01
is  V03
being  V03
mitigated  V01
and  
we  >>>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
ensure  V01
Enron  >ARG1
top  >ARGM-ADJ
management  V01
that  
there  
is  V02
consistency  <ARG1
in  
operating  
standards  
worldwide  <ARGM-LOC
.  

These  
global  
standards  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
should  >ARGM-MOD
enable  V01
Enron  >ARG0
to  
expand  V01
its  
business  
reach  <ARG1
more  
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
,  
with  
well  
defined  >ARGM-ADJ
requirements  V01
with  
regard  V01
to  
trading  >ARG1
operations  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
am  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure  V02
from  
the  
article  <ARGM-DIR
as  
written  V01
that  
the  
global  
nature  >>ARG1
of  
this  
effort  V01
comes  V15
across  
.  

Finally  
,  
a  
question  
regarding  
timing  V02
.  

The  
last  >>>ARG1
I  >ARG0
knew  V01
after  
you  >ARG0
and  
Brent  
drafted  V01
this  
starting  
point  <ARG1
for  
fundamental  
operating  
standards  
was  V01
that  
this  >>>ARG1
was  V03
being  V03
circulated  V01
(  
Shona  >ARG0
took  V01
this  >ARG1
to  
do  V02
after  
Brent  >ARG1
's  
return  V01
to  
Houston  <ARG4
)  
for  
comments  V01
to  
all  
business  
controllers  <<<ARGM-GOL
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
believe  V01
that  
we  >ARG1
are  V01
quite  <ARGM-ADV
at  
the  
point  >ARGM-ADV
that  >R-ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
that  
all  
business  
controllers  >>>ARG0
worldwide  
have  V01
reviewed  V01
,  
understand  V01
and  
have  V01
implemented  V01
these  
standards  <ARG1
.  

And  >>>ARGM-DIS
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
belittle  V01
the  
process  V02
of  
creating  V01
the  
standards  <ARG1
,  
the  
tough  
part  >ARG1
(  
and  
the  
real  
meat  
behind  
this  
)  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
an  
effective  >ARGM-ADJ
exception  >ARGM-ADJ
report  V01
on  
a  
global  
basis  <ARG1
against  
these  
standards  <ARGM-ADV
.  

My  >ARG1
commitment  V01
to  
Rick  <ARG2
Causey  
is  V01
that  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
have  V04
that  
global  >ARGM-ADJ
report  V01
in  
production  V01
by  
the  
end  V01
of  
the  
year  <ARG1
.  

There  
is  V02
much  >ARGM-ADJ
work  V01
to  
do  VLV
in  
defining  V01
the  
content  <ARG1
and  
regularity  
of  
the  
report  V01
and  
even  >ARGM-ADJ
more  >ARGM-ADJ
work  V01
to  
do  VLV
to  
identify  V01
reliable  
sources  <ARG1
of  
data  
for  
compiling  V01
the  
report  V01
.  

Shona  >>ARG0
has  V01
commissioned  V01
Mike  >ARG0
Moscoso  
to  
work  V01
on  
this  <ARG1
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
believe  V01
that  
Mike  >>>ARG0
has  V01
already  >>ARGM-TMP
been  V03
working  V01
with  
James  <ARG3
New  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
question  V01
whether  
or  
not  
you  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
publish  V01
info  <ARG1
about  
fundamental  
standards  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
yet  >ARGM-TMP
report  V01
against  <C-ARG1
.  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
a  
more  
appropriate  
time  >ARG1
be  V01
after  
the  
Global  
Operations  
Controller  >ARG0
meeting  V03
in  
October  <ARGM-TMP
when  >R-ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
worldwide  
buy  
-  
in  <ARG1
and  
commitment  V01
to  
these  
standards  <ARG2
and  
(  
hopefully  
)  
our  
first  
draft  
of  
a  
meaningful  >ARGM-ADJ
exception  >ARGM-ADJ
report  V01
?  

Sorry  
that  
this  
response  V01
looks  V02
so  >ARGM-EXT
long  V03
.  

I  >>>ARG1
have  V01
been  V03
interrupted  V01
20  
times  <ARGM-TMP
while  
responding  V01
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
hope  V01
that  
it  >>ARG1
makes  VLV
sense  V02
.  

Thanks  V01
for  
sharing  V01
this  <ARG1
with  
me  <ARG2
.  

Since  
you  >ARG0
asked  V02
for  
input  V02
,  
I  >ARG0
hope  V01
that  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
mind  V01
that  
I  >ARG0
gave  V01
you  <ARG2
some  <ARG1

the

The

also  >>ARGM-DIS

:  

At  
this  
point  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
our  >ARG0
IT  >ARG1
contacts  V01
are  V03
backpedalling  V01
a  
bit  <ARGM-EXT
and  
suggesting  V01
they  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
overcome  V01
the  
TIBCO  
and  
Terminal  
Server  
problems  <ARG1
.  

There  
are  V02
still  <ARGM-TMP
four  
important  >ARGM-ADJ
issues  V02
,  
however  <<ARGM-DIS
:  

IT  >ARG1
still  >ARGM-TMP
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
commit  V01
to  
transferring  V01
messages  <ARG1
across  
domains  <ARGM-DIR
.  

This  >ARG1
means  V01
that  
messages  >>>ARG0
initiated  V01
at  
Corp  <ARGM-LOC
and  
intended  V01
for  
the  
entire  
Enron  
organization  <ARGM-GOL
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
reach  V02
any  
business  
units  <ARG1
outside  
the  
Corp  
domain  
.  

No  
messages  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
reach  V01
the  
EES  
organization  <ARG1
unless  
IBM  >>>ARG0
agrees  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
use  V01
their  
proprietary  
message  >ARG1
delivery  V01
tool  <<ARG1
,  
WebSphere  
,  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
use  V01
WebLogic  <ARG1
instead  <ARGM-ADV
.  

WebLogic  >>ARG1
is  V03
required  V01
by  
BackWeb  <ARG0
,  
although  
it  >>ARG1
is  V03
designed  V01
by  
a  
separate  
company  <ARG0
.  

HR  >>>ARG0
,  
intended  V01
to  
be  V01
a  
key  
user  <ARG2
of  
this  
tool  
,  
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
use  V01
BackWeb  <ARG1
because  
survey  >ARG1
responses  V01
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
made  V02
anonymous  <ARG1
.  

HR  >>ARG0
has  V01
already  >ARGM-TMP
purchased  V01
a  
tool  >>>ARG0
called  V01
CONFIRMIT  <ARG2
that  >>R-ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
execute  V02
anonymous  >ARGM-ADJ
surveys  V01
.  

Messages  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
delivered  V01
simultaneously  <ARGM-TMP
to  
all  
users  <ARG2
in  
the  
same  
domain  
,  
nor  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
they  >>ARG1
be  V03
delivered  V01
for  
two  
to  
five  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
after  
they  >>ARG1
are  V03
sent  V01
by  
the  
message  
administrator  <ARG0
.  

Another  
thing  >>ARG1
to  
consider  V02
is  V01
that  
these  
messages  >>>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
set  V08
to  
expire  V01
and  
disappear  V01
within  
a  
set  
period  <ARGM-TMP
of  
time  
,  
meaning  V01
users  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
retrieve  V01
them  <ARG1
and  
read  V01
them  <ARG1
later  <ARGM-TMP
(  
as  
they  
can  
with  
e-mail  <ARGM-ADV
)  
.  

This  >ARG1
means  V01
that  
I  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
away  <ARG2
from  
the  
office  
for  
several  
days  <ARGM-TMP
and  
miss  V02
a  
message  <ARG1
entirely  <ARGM-EXT
,  
because  
it  >>>ARG1
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
expired  V01
and  
disappeared  V01
by  
the  
time  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
returned  V01
.  

The  
plain  
fact  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
a  
few  
members  >>ARG0
of  
IT  
are  V03
pushing  V02
this  
initiative  <ARG2
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
lack  V01
commercial  
sponsorship  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
are  V03
hoping  V01
Corp  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
foot  V01
the  
bill  <ARG1
for  
a  
pilot  >ARG0
which  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
allow  V01
them  >ARG0
to  
fully  >ARGM-EXT
test  V01
this  
tool  <ARG1
before

it  <ARG1

A

the  
advances  V01
of  
women  >ARG0
in  
achieving  V01
equality  <ARG1
throughout  
the  
world  <ARGM-LOC

Barbara  >ARG0
Walters  
did  V02
a  
story  <ARG1
on  
gender  
roles  
in  
Kuwait  
several  
years  
before  
the  
Gulf  
War  <ARGM-TMP
.  

She  >ARG0
noted  V01
then  <ARGM-TMP
that  
women  >ARG0
customarily  >ARGM-MNR
walked  V01
about  
10  
feet  
behind  
their  
husbands  <ARGM-LOC
.  

She  >>ARG0
returned  V01
to  
Kuwait  <ARG4
recently  <ARGM-TMP
and  
observed  V01
that  
the  
men  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
walked  V01
several  
yards  
behind  
their  
wives  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Ms.  >>ARG0
Walters  
approached  V01
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
women  
and  
said  V01
,  
"  
This  >ARG1
is  V01
marvelous  <ARG2
.  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
tell  V01
the  
free

just  
what  >>ARG0
enabled  V01

to

this

to  
create  V01
an  
eSpeak

The

was  V01
tremendous  <ARG2

,  
in  
some  
cases  
,  
very  
creative  
.  

Your  
fellow

asked  V02
for  
everyone  <ARG1
from

In

Those

be  V01
somewhat  >ARGM-EXT
easier  V05

meet  V01
,  
although  
scheduling  V01
time  <ARG1
with  
some  <ARGM-COM

How  >ARG2

Wednesday  <ARG1

I  >>>ARG0
did  V01
look  V01
at  
EOL  <ARG1
and  
am  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
surprised  V01
to  
see  V01
its  
quality  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
was  V01

about

in

because  
of  
deadline

How  >>ARGM-MNR
is  V03
the  
site  >ARG0
doing  V02
?  

I  >>>ARG0
am  V03
intrigued  V01
by  
the  
competition  V01
for  
trading  
platforms  <ARG3
and  
was  V01
astonished  V01
to  
hear  V01
that  
Goldman  >>>ARG0
,  
Morgan  
,  
BP  
and  
Shell  
were  V03
going  V04
to  
launch  V01
a

compete  V01
with  
yours  <ARG1

Talk  V01
about

If  
we  >ARG0

time  <ARG1
next

I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
step  V01
you  <ARG1
through  
our  
website  <ARGM-DIR
--  
www.weathereffects.com  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
proud  V01
of  
what  >>ARG1
we  >>ARG0
've  V01
done  V02
.  

I  >>>ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
give  V06
out  
a

yet  <ARGM-TMP
but  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
happy  V01
to  
walk  V01
through

with  
you  <ARGM-COM
over  
the  
phone  <ARGM-MNR
using  V01
my

.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
very  
ambitious  
site  <ARG2

It  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
nice  V01
to

what  >>ARG1
do  V01
you  >ARG0
think  V01
?  

Joe_Lardy@cargill.com  
on  
03/02/2001

AM  

Currently  >ARGM-TMP
Cargill  >ARG0
and  
Enron  
have  V03
a  
15  
MM  
collateral  
threshold  <ARG1
.  

If  
possible  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
the  
cleanest  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
to  
run  V01
this  
biz  <ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
to  
put  V01
a  
box  <ARG1
around  
the  
prime  
broker  
biz  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
operate  V01
under  
the  
master  
isda  <ARGM-MNR
but  
could  >ARGM-MOD
set  V03
up  
a  
mutually  
agreeable  
credit  >ARG1
support  V01
annex  <<ARG1
for  
this  
biz  
.  

We  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
keep  V02
the  
20,000,000  
line  >ARG1
referenced  V04
in  
Schedule  
B  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
POA  >ARG1
agreement  V01
.  

The  
line  >ARG1
in  
the  
POA  
is  V01
a  
seperate  >ARGM-ADJ
and  
distinct  
measure  V02
from  
the  
daily  
collateral  <ARG0
.  

The  
20  
mill  >ARG1
reflects  V01
gross  >ARGM-ADJ
exposure  V01
.  

Let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
if  
you  >ARG0
think  V01
this  >>ARG1
is  V01
reasonable  V02
and  
workable  
.  

We  >>ARG1
too  
,  
are  V01
open  V05
to  
suggestion  V01
as  
the  
Global  >ARG0
and  
Enron  
relationships  V03
are  V01
very  
important  <ARG2
and  
a  
high  
priority  
to  
us  
.  

Thanks  V01

regading  V01

I  >>>ARG0
am  V03
going  V04
to  
find  V03
out  
how  
much  
line  >>ARG2
we  >ARG0
currently  >ARGM-TMP
have  V03
available  V02
...  
you  >ARG0
probably  >ARGM-ADV
already  >ARGM-TMP
have  V03
this  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
allocate  V01
a  
piece  <ARG1
to  
Global  <ARG2
which  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
solve  V01
the  
problem  <ARG1
of  
other  
Cargill  
people  >ARG0
using  V01
the  
line  <ARG1
,  
putting  V03
us  <ARG1
over  
the  
limit  V01
,  
without  
me  >ARG0
knowing  V01
...  

We  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
change  V01
the  
language  <ARG1
of  
the  
POA  
to  
this  <ARG2
...  

we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
go  V26
over  V_
Global  
's  
piece  <ARG1
of  
the  
Cargill  
line  
...  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
this  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
solve  V01
our  >ARG1
main  >ARGM-ADJ
concern  V01
...  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
...  
we  >>>ARG0
are  V01
eager  V01
to  
keep  V02

with  
Global  <ARG2

yourselves

watched  V01
them  >ARG1
die  V01
,  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
very  
defining  
time  <ARG2
in  
our  
lives  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
we  >>>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
very  
thankful  <ARG2
to  
have  V03
such  
great  
parents  <ARG1
and  
to  
have  V01
had  V03
the  
privilege  <ARG1
to  
have  V01
been  V03
raised  V03
in  
such  
loving  
homes  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Sounds  V01
as  
though  
Eric  >>ARG0
has  V01
done  V02
very  
well  <ARGM-MNR
as  
SMSU  <ARGM-LOC
.  

He  >>ARG0
is  V03
joining  V04
an  
excellent  
company  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
am  V01
also  <ARGM-ADV
delighted  <ARG2
to  
hear  V01
that  
he  >>>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
continue  V01
his  >ARG1
education  V01
working  V06
toward  
an  
MBA  <ARG1
.  

As  
we  >>ARG0
are  V03
living  V01
in  
an  
age  >ARGM-TMP
where  >R-ARGM-TMP
intellectual  
capital  >ARG1
is  V01
so  
valuable  <ARG2
,  
it  
is  V01
important  V01
for  
every  
young  
person  >ARG0
to  
obtain  V01
the  
very  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
possible  >ARGM-ADJ
education  V01
they  
can  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

As  
to  
our  
family  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
within  
the  
last  
ten  
days  >>ARGM-TMP
our  
youngest  
daughter  >>ARG1
Elizabeth  
was  V03
married  V01
to  
a  
young  
man  <ARG2
from  
Buenos  
Aires  
,  
Argentina  
.  

They  >ARG0
met  V02
while  
they  >>ARG0
were  V03
both  >ARGM-ADV
working  V01
on  
a  
project  <ARG1
as  
lawyers  <ARGM-PRD
in  
Buenos  
Aires  <ARGM-LOC
.  

They  >>>ARG1
're  V01
currently  <ARGM-TMP
on  
their  >ARG0
honeymoon  V01
but  
shortly  
after  
returning  V01
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
moving  V01
from  
Buenos  
Aires  <ARGM-DIR
to  
Miami  <ARG2
,  
Florida  
.  

This  
past  
Thursday  
night  >>ARGM-TMP
our  
sixth  
grandchild  >>ARG1
was  V03
born  V02
.  

It  >>ARG1
was  V03
born  V02
to  
our  
son  <ARG0
David  
and  
his  
wife  
Courtney  
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
7  
lb.  
,  
10  
oz.  
,  
20  
inch  
little  
boy  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
have  V03
three  
grandsons  >ARG1
and  
three  
granddaughters  
ranging  V01
from  
about  
2  
years  <ARG3
-  
4  
months  
down  
to  
a  
few  
days  
.  

They  >ARG1
are  V01
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
deal  V03
of  
fun  V01
.  

We  >>ARG0
are  V03
doing  V02
quite  
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >>ARG0
am  V03
looking  V03
forward  
to  
seeing  V01
Ginger  
"  
Rees  
"  
Copeland  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG1
comes  V01
to  
Houston  <ARG4
.  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
delighted  <ARG2
to  
arrange  V01
tickets  <ARG1
for  
you  
and  
your  
family  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
you  >>ARGM-GOL
ever  >>ARGM-TMP
have  VLV
occasion  V02
to  
visit  V01
Houston  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
hope  V01
you  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
great  
summer  <ARG1
.  

Thank  V01
you  <ARG1
for  
your  >ARG0
recent  >ARGM-TMP
request  V01
for  
Mr.  >ARG0
Lay  
to

Unfortunately  >>ARGM-ADV

hard  V02
on  
me  <C-ARG1
to  
sale  V05
my  
old  
dodge  
truck  <ARG1

I  >>ARG0
said  V01
Yep  <ARG1
,  
had  V03
that  
truck  <ARG1
longer  <ARGM-TMP
than  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
had  V03
most  <ARG1
of  
my  
women  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
need  V01
to  
engage  V01
brain  <ARG1
before  
articulating  V01
!  

I  >>>ARG0
am  V03
doing  VLV
dirt  >ARGM-LOC
work  V01
and  
hope  V01
to  
plant  V01
ST  
Augustine  
Grass  <ARG1
by  
Friday  <ARGM-TMP
before  
rain  <ARGM-TMP
.  

One  
thing  >ARG1
is  V01
for  
sure  <ARG2
,  
the  
economy  >>ARG1
is  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
faltering  V01
on  
my  
account  <ARGM-CAU
.  

Dow  
Stock  >ARG1
is  V01
back  <ARG2
up  
over  
$  
33  
.  

Hooray  
,  
hoorah  
!  

Needs  V01
to  
go  V01
to  
$  <ARG4
41  
and  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
happy  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
spoke  V01
with  
Gerald  <ARG2
and  
he  >ARG0
said  V01
there  
are  V02
a  
bunch  <ARG1
of  
folks  >ARG1
hanging  V02
around  
Dad  
's  
place  <ARG2
.  

We  >>>ARG0
need  V01
to  
change  V01
the  
lock  <ARG1
and  
place  V01
posted  
signs  <ARG1
at  
the  
gate  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
want  V01
to  
put  V01
some  
steers  <ARG1
or  
heifers  
up  
there  <ARG2
.  

I  >>>ARG0
am  V03
going  V02
up  <ARG1
soon  <ARGM-TMP
and  
having  V04
the  
tractor  >ARG1
fixed  V02
.  

Reggie  >ARG0
said  V01
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
pay  V01
us  <ARG2
soon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
still  >ARGM-TMP
wants  V01
the  
tractor  <ARG1
if  
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
hold  V06
on  
to  
it  <ARG1
.  

First  >ARGM-TMP
come  V01
,  
first  >ARGM-TMP
serve  V02
.  

When  >ARG2
is  V01
the  
wedding  V01
?  

We  >>ARG1
're  V03
set  V08
for  
11/01/01  <ARG2
.  

Be  V01
sure  V01
to  
take  V01
your  
sweety  <ARG1
out  <ARG3
on  
the  
balcony  
tonight  <ARGM-TMP
and  
gaze  V01
at  
the  
full  
moon  <ARG1
.  

It  >>>ARG1
was  V01
sure  >ARGM-ADV
beautiful  V02
coming  V13
up  
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>>ARG0
used  V03
to  
go  V17
out  
and  
lay  V01
in  
the  
pasture  <ARG2
on  
a  
blanket  <ARGM-LOC
and  
watch  V01
for  
the  
space  
shuttle  <ARGM-GOL
.  

I  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
couple  <ARG1
of  
hickies  
on  
my  
neck  <ARGM-LOC
the  
day  
after  <ARGM-TMP
and  
the  
guys  >>ARG0
all  
wanted  V01
to  
know  V01
if  
those  >ARG1
were  V01
shuttle  >ARG0
burns  V01
.  

Just  
jealous  
.  

My  
kid  >>>ARG0
is  V03
making  V05
wonderful  
grades  <ARG1
and  
has  V01
reassured  V01
me  <ARG1
she  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
graduate  V01
within  
the  
four  
year  
period  <ARGM-TMP
.  

She  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
has  V03
some  
sort  <ARG1
of  
scholarship  
but  
I  >ARG1
am  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
for  
sure  <ARG2
how  
much  >ARG1
it  >ARG0
pays  V01
.  

She  >>>ARG1
is  V03
going  V04
to  
be  V01
a  
kinesiologist  <ARG2
,  
sports  >ARG2
injury  V01
therapist  
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
she  >>>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
wants  V01
to  
be  V01
able  V01
to  
touch  V01
football  
players  
legs  <ARG1
.  

She  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
20  <ARG2
on  
11/03  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
am  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
proud  V01
of  
her  <ARG1
.  

Cindy  >ARG0
said  V01
Jaime  >>ARG1
has  V01
grown  V04
up  
very  
much  <ARGM-EXT
.  

You  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
e  
mail  V01
her  <ARG2
sometimes  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
am  V01
sure  V02
she  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
hear  V01
from  
you  <ARG2
.  

Jgerma5@aol.com  
.  

At  
any  
rate  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
be  V01
careful  V04
and  
be  V01
safe  V01
.  

You  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
listened  V01
to  
Maw  <ARG1
,  
as  
long  >>>ARGM-ADV
as  
you  >ARG0
keep  V02
your  
mouth  <ARG1
shut  <ARG2
and  
your  
pants  
zipped  
,  
you  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
alright  V01
.  

Shucks  >ARGM-DIS
,  
guess  V01
none  >>ARG0
of  
us  
three  
paid  VLV
much  >ARGM-ADJ
attention  V02
to  
that  <ARG1
.  

Oh  >ARGM-DIS
,  
Jeff  >ARG0
Sherrar  
has  V03
a  
new

out  
.  

Rise  V01

There  
were  V02
some  
pretty  
cool  
dudes  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-ADV
around  
1774

.  

There  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V02
two

this

I  >ARG1
am  V01
half

you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
borrow  V01
it  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
am  V01
through  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
sure  >ARGM-ADV
like  V01
his  
style  <ARG1
of  
writing  V01
.  

His  
books  >>ARG1
are  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
hard  V02
to  
put  V01
down  <ARG2
.  

After  
the  
split  
Dow  
Stock  >ARGM-TMP
there  
are  V02
120

What  >>ARG1
's  V03
happening  V01
?  

I  >ARG0

you  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
brand  
new  
truck  <ARG1
.  

Must  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
nice  V01
having  V03
money  <ARG1
!!  

I  >ARG0
need  V01
2  
things  <ARG1
from  
you  
.  

1  
.  
I  >ARG0
found  V01
the  
title  <ARG1
to  
the  
4  
wheeler  
and  
I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
going  V04
to  
change  V01
it  <ARG1
over  <ARGM-DIR
to  
you  
name  <ARG2
.  

What  >>ARG1
do  V01
you  >ARG0
think  V01
?  

If  
that  >ARG1
's  V01
ok  <ARG2
,  
how  >>>ARGM-MNR
do  V01
you  >ARG0
want  V01
your  
name  >ARG1
to  
show  V02
up  
on  
the  
title  <ARGM-LOC
and  
what  
address  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
use  V01
?  

2  
.  
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V03
getting  V03
ready  V02
to  
divy  V01
up  
the  
Dow  
stock  <ARG1
.  

How  
many  >>>ARG1
of  
Dad  >ARG0
's  
shares  V01
do  V01
you  >ARG0
have  V03
?  

Last  
thing  >ARGM-ADV
,  
send  V01
me  <ARG2
a  
million  
dollars  <ARG1
,  
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V01
tired  V03
of  
working  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
thought  V01
we  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
had  V03
cashout  <ARG1
,  
at  
most  
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
,  
before  
this  
June  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
remember  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
know  V01
that  
most  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
time  
this  
plant  >>ARG0
was  V03
not  
buring  V02
like  
it  
did  V01
in  
July  <<ARGM-MNR
and  
August  
of  
this  
year  
.  

I  >ARG0
say  V01
we  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
keep  V01
the  
dough  <ARG1
and  
go  V02
to  
Mexico  <ARG4
.  

Hey  
guys  
,  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
please  >ARGM-DIS
ck  V01
the  
Oglethorpe  >ARG0
deal  V01
from  
July  <<ARGM-TMP
2000  
-  
Dec  
2000  
?  

Is  V03
there  >ARG1
supposed  V02
to  
be  V02
a  
cashout  >ARG1
booked  V03
in  
Sitara  <<ARGM-LOC
for  
these  
months  <<ARGM-TMP
?  

Oglethorpe  >ARG0
over  >ARGM-EXT
paid  V01
their  
invoice  <ARG2
every  
month  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
believe  V01
that  
Doug  >ARG0
told  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
extra  >ARG1
was  V01
for  
the  
cashout  >>ARG3
that  >>R-ARG3
was  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
invoiced  V01
.  

Thanks  V01

Hello  
-  

I  >ARG0
spoke  V01
with  
Jeff  <ARG2
Hodge  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
regarding  
the  
additional  
language  <ARG1
from  
Peoples  
regarding  
Audit  >ARG2
Rights  V05
.  

His  >ARG0
initial  >ARGM-TMP
reaction  V01
was  V01
that  
their  >ARG0
request  V01
was  V01
probably  <ARGM-ADV
reasonable  <ARG2
and  
in  
line  
with  
the  
spirit  
of  
a  
jointly  
owned  
L.L.C  
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >>>ARG0
did  V01
suggest  V01
a  
couple  
slight  >ARGM-ADJ
revisions  V01
to  
protect  V01
Enron  >ARG1
's  
interests  V01

that  
each  
designated  
representative  >ARG0

It  
is  V01
less  
complicated  <ARG2
for  
me  >>ARG0
to  
initial  V01

fax  V01

to  
track  V02
down  
someone  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0

n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
anything  <ARG1
about  
it

get  V04
them  >ARG0
to

I  >>>ARG0

Plus  
,  
I  >ARG0
work  V01
with

she  >ARG0

a

Since  
it

Janet  >ARG0
signing  V01
,  
it  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
probably  >>ARGM-ADV

the

Either

Kay  

Hello  
-  

I  >ARG0
spoke  V01
with  
Jeff  <ARG2
Hodge  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
regarding  
the  
additional  
language  <ARG1
from  
Peoples  
regarding  
Audit  >ARG2
Rights  V05
.  

His  >ARG0
initial  >ARGM-TMP
reaction  V01
was  V01
that  
their  >ARG0
request  V01
was  V01
probably  <ARGM-ADV
reasonable  <ARG2
and  
in  
line  
with  
the  
spirit  
of  
a  
jointly  
owned  
L.L.C  
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >>>ARG0
did  V01
suggest  V01
a  
couple  
slight  >ARGM-ADJ
revisions  V01
to  
protect  V01
Enron  >ARG1
's  
interests  V01
.  

1  
)  
Highlighting  V01
that  
information  >>>ARG1

only  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V03
provided  V01
that  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
related  V01
to  
enovate  <ARG2
and  
2  
)  
that  
each  
designated  
representative  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
sign  V02
an  
appropriate  >ARGM-ADJ
confidentiality  >ARG1
agreement  V01
.  

This  
language  >>>ARG1
has  V01
been  V03
included  V01
in  
the  
attached  
draft  <ARG2
.  

My  
goal  >ARG1

however

I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
working  V01
on  
it  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Maybe  >>ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0

could  >>ARGM-MOD

it  <ARG1
tomorrow  
morning  <ARGM-TMP

Does  V01

Kay  

It  
was  V01
good  V02
to  
hear  V01
from  
you  <ARG2
!  

We  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
nice  
Thanksgiving  <ARG1
here  <ARGM-LOC
too  <ARGM-ADV
.  

It  >>ARG1
's  V01
funny  V02
,  
because  
usually  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
's  V01
just  <ARGM-ADV
me  <ARG2
,  
Mom  
,  
Craig  
and  
Danelia  
,  
and  
Danelia  >>ARG0
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-EXT
like  V01
roasted  
turkey  <ARG1
or  
roast  
beef  
(  
not  
that  
she  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
me  <ARG2
!  
)  
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
there  
is  V02
not  <ARGM-NEG
just  <ARGM-ADV
the  
same  
joy  >>ARG2
in  
cooking  V01
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
elsewise  <ARGM-LOC
.  

It  
was  V01
good  V02
having  V04
the  
girls  <ARG1
down  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
played  V01
a  
new  
version  >>>ARG2
of  
Uno  
called  V01
"  
African  
Uno  <ARG2
"  
that  >>>R-ARG2
was  V01
complex  V01
,  
fast  V02
and  
at  
times  >ARGM-TMP
,  
physically  >ARGM-MNR
challenging  V01
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
for  
the  
meek  <ARG2
.  

It  
was  V01
incredible  <ARG2
what  
a  
good  
player  >ARG2
Alena  >ARG1
was  V01
.  

She  >ARG0
had  V03
her  
cards  >ARG1
memorized  V01
as  
well  
as  
everyone  <C-ARG1
else  
s  
(  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
play  V01
you  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
why  >ARGM-CAU
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
know  V01
everyone  
else  
s  
hands  <ARG1
!  
)  
.  

I  >ARG0
expect  V01
Craig  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
Mom  >ARG0
to  
see  V01
his  
place  <ARG1
because  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
messy  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
compared  
to  
my  
house  >ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >ARG1
's  V01
embarrased  <ARG2
about  
his  
apartment  
.  

Then  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >>ARG0
's  V03
got  V02
so  
much  
stuff  <ARG1
in  
there  <ARGM-LOC
right  
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
that  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
how  >>>ARGM-MNR
he  >>>ARG0
's  V03
going  V04
to  
fit  V01
baby  
stuff  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
give  V01
him  <ARG2
a  
6  
month  
lease  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
renewed  V01
his  
lease  <ARG1
last  
month  <ARGM-TMP
because  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
3  
people  <ARG1
in  
that  
small  
apartment  <ARGM-LOC
.  

So  
he  >>>ARG0
's  V03
going  V04
to  
have  V02
to  
start  V01
looking  V01
for  
another  
place  <ARG1
.  

And  
his  
apartment  >ARG1
is  V01
so  
run  <ARG2
down  
down  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
afraid  V01
roaches  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
crawling  V01
over  
the  
baby  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
guess  V01
Mom  >>>ARG0
is  V03
going  V04
to  
come  V01
back  
down  <ARGM-DIR
sometime  
in  
March  <ARGM-TMP
or  
April  
to  
see  V01
the  
new  
baby  <ARG1
.  

You  >>>ARG0
'll  
have  V02
to  
come  V28
visit  V01
to  
check  V05
out  
my  
new  
house  <ARG1
.  

The  
upstairs  
"  
guest  
suite  >ARG1
"  
is  V01
pretty  
neat  <ARG2
.  

It  >>>ARG1
's  V03
got  V02
its  
own  
bathroom  <ARG1
and  
tv  
,  
and  
is  V01
pretty  
cozy  <ARG2
.  

As  
far  >>>ARGM-ADV
as  
the  
call  V02
with  
Uncle  <ARG1
Ben  
goes  V06
,  
if  
he  >>ARG0
was  V01
thrilled  >>ARG1
to  
hear  V01
from  
me  <ARG2
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tell  V02
by  
his  >ARG0
voice  V01
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
pretty  
stilted  >ARGM-ADJ
conversation  V01
for  
both  <<ARGM-GOL
of  
us  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
guess  V01
,  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
start  V01
...  

I  
've  V01
already  
made  VLV
my  >ARG0
XMAS  >ARG1
plans  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
leave  V11
the  
evening  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
21st  
,  
my  >ARG1
flight  V01
comes  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
about  
10  
pm  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
leave  V11
the  
morning  <ARGM-TMP

the  
27th

Regards  V01

bd  

Attached  V01
is  V03
the  
referenced  V04
agreement  V01
.  

Let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
if  
the  
notice  
information  >ARG1
is  V01
OK  <ARG2
with  
you  
.  

If  
so  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>>ARG0
'll  >>>ARGM-MOD
get  V04
it  >ARG1
signed  V01
by  
Craig  <ARG0
Breslau  
today  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
bring  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
you  <ARG2
for  
countersignature  <ARGM-PRP
.  

Thinking  V01
about  
that  <ARG2
,  
what  >ARG2
's  V01
your  
title  <ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure  V02
you  >ARG0
have  V03
the  
authority  <ARG1
to  
sign  V01
documents  <ARG1
w/o  
special  
authority  <ARGM-MNR
...  

No  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
it  >>ARG1
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
mean  V01
that  <ARG2
.  

Adding  V02
all  
the  
Enron  
"  
Specified  
Entities  <ARG1
"  
would  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
make  V01
a  
default  V01
under  
a  
financial  >ARG1
transaction  V01
with  
those  
other  
Enron  
entities  <ARG2
a  
default  V01
under  
this  
agreement  V01
.  

Our  >ARG1
concern  V01
is  V01
that  
we  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
any  
trading  
related  >ARGM-ADJ
defaults  V01
to  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
trigger  V01
a  
default  V01
under  
a

has  V03
a

a

If  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
add  V02
all  
the  
entities  <ARG1
,  
does  V01
that  >ARG1
mean  V01
that  
we  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
need  V01
to  
put  V03
in  
place  <ARG2
a  
separate  >ARGM-ADJ

With

to

,  
we  >ARG0

and  
we  >>>ARG0
are  V01
somewhat  >ARGM-EXT
hesitant  V01
to  
do  V02
so  <ARG1
,  
as

up

into

spoke  V01
to

Taylor  
about  
your

and  
he  >ARG0
agrees  V01
that

have  V03
the

execute  V02

Thank  V01
you  <ARG1
,  

Russell  

Hey  
there  
yourself  
,  

Sorry  
I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
written  V01
you  <ARG2
guys  
in  
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
to  
keep  V02
you  >ARG1
properly  >ARGM-ADV
updated  V02
.  

I  >>>ARG0
am  V03
indeed  >ARGM-ADV
checking  V01
on  
flights  V01
to  
Seoul  <ARGM-DIR
and  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V03
going  V04
to  
go  V02
at  
exactly  
the  
same  
time  <ARGM-TMP
as  
my  
parents  
.  

As  
much  >ARGM-CXN
fun  V01
as  
they  >ARG1
are  V01
,  
I  >ARG0
figured  V01
we  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
do  V02
some  
different  
things  <ARG1
than  
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
have  V01
planned  V01
for  
them  <ARG3
.  

As  
for  
Ted  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
things  >>ARG1
are  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
going  V06
well  <ARGM-MNR
although  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see  V01
him  <ARG1
at  
all  <ARGM-EXT
this  
week  <ARGM-TMP
(  
we  >ARG1
are  V01
two  
very  
busy  
people  <ARG2
)  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
,  
we  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
great  
laid  
back  
day  <ARG1
last  
Saturday  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >>>ARG0
think  V01
have  V01
hit  V02
that  
comfortable  
stage  <ARG1
...  
you  >ARG0
know  V01
,  
not  
quite  
so  
formal  
about  
dates  
etc  
.  

In  
one  
sense  V01
it  >>ARG1
's  V01
great  V01
,  
but  
it  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
makes  V02
things  >ARG1
a  
lot  >ARGM-ADJ
harder  V02
to  
read  V01
.  

Anyway  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
sure  V02
my  
Mom  >ARG0
told  V01
you  <ARG2
guys  
but  
Travis  >>ARG0
and  
Kathy  
got  V22
to  
meet  V02
him  <ARG1
and  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
it  >ARG1
went  V06
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Hopefully  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
if  
we  >>ARG0
're  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
dating  V02
come  V01
December  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
and  
Chuck  
can  >ARGM-MOD
meet  V03
him  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
come  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
to  
visit  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
planning  V01
on  
dragging  V01
him  <ARG1
to  
at  
least  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
U.T.  
games  
,  
I  >>>ARG0
just  >>>ARGM-DIS
have  V02
to  
find  V03
out  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
wants  V01
to  
go  V02
(  
as  
well  
as  
properly  >ARGM-MNR
prepare  V02
him  <ARG1
for  
the  
Scott  
/  
Kelley  
/  
Parks  
/  
Wild  
Card  
gang  <ARG2
and  
the  
full  
-  
day  
affair  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
is  V01
a  
U.T.  
game  <ARG2
)  
.  

Things  >>>ARG1
in  
Houston  
are  V01
good  V02
and  
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
warm  V07
.  

I  >>ARG0
went  V02
with  
Emily  <ARGM-COM
and  
her  
Mom  
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
to  
see  V01
the  
musical  
"  
Rent  <ARG1
"  
and  
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
wonderful  V03
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V03
going  V02
out  <ARG4
to  
San  
Diego  
for  
the  
Labor  
Day  
weekend  <ARGM-TMP
to  
visit  V01
Hoot  
's  
daughter  <ARG1
Julie  
.  

Needless  >>>ARGM-ADV
to  
say  V01
I  >>ARG1
am  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
excited  V01
.  

Talk  V01
to  
you  
guys  <ARG2
soon  <ARGM-TMP
,  

Susan  

Hey  
girlie  
,  

How  >>ARGM-MNR
are  V03
you  >ARG0
doing  V02
?  

Have  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
heard  V01
from  
you  <ARG2
in  
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
.  

A  
little  
birdie  >ARG0
told  V01
me  <ARG2
that  
you  >>ARG0
were  V03
checking  V01
into  
tickets  <ARG1
for  
Seoul  
.  

Are  V03
you  
really  
?  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG1
come  V01
with  
your  
parents  <ARGM-COM
or  
separately  
?  

In  
any  
case  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >>ARG0
have  V01
had  V03
some  
more  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
to  
do  V02
some  
exploring  V01
(  
and  
shopping  V01
)  
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
have  V03
some  
good  
ideas  <ARG1
about  
what  >ARG1
to  
do  V02
if  
you  >ARG1
come  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
that  
we  >>>ARG0
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
stay  V01
in  
Korea  <ARG3
when  >ARGM-TMP
your  
parents  >ARG1
come  V01
and  
do  V02
the  
whole  
base  
thing  >ARG0
(  
which  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
take  V10
only  
a  
few  
minutes  <ARG1
,  
actually  <ARGM-ADV
)  
,  
but  
are  V03
considering  V02
going  V02
to  
China  <ARG4
or  
somewhere  
during  
part  <ARGM-TMP
of  
Thanksgiving  
.  

We  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
whatever  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
want  V01
want  V01
if  
you  >>ARG1
still  >>ARGM-TMP
are  V03
coming  V01
!  

Let  V01
us  >ARG0
know  V01
the  
latest  <ARG1
with  
Ted  
and  
also  
with  
what  >>ARG1
's  V03
going  V15
on  
in  
Houston  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Take  VLV
care  V03
,  

Chris

Tonto  
(  
a.k.a  
-  
the  
trusty  
,  
but  
silent  
,  
side  
-  
kick  
to  
the  
Lone  
Ranger  
or  
in  
this  
case  
the  
Big  
D  
)  

The  
play  V12
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
good  V02
and  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
well  
received  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'd  V01
forgotten  V01
how  
blown  >ARG2
away  
I  >ARG1
was  V01
by  
some  <ARGM-CAU
of  
the  
songs  
the  
first  
time  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
saw  V01
it  <ARG1
in  
NY  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
cast  
members  >>>ARG0
really  
have  V02
to  
have  V03
incredibly  
powerful  
voices  V01
to  
pull  V03
off  
a  
few  <ARG1
of  
the  
most  
poignant  
numbers  
(  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
this  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
your  >ARG1
true  >ARGM-ADJ
calling  V02
)  
.  

I  >ARG0
caught  V01
the  
third  
day  <ARG1
of  
Corey  >ARG0
's  
Jeopardy  >ARG1
run  V13
last  
night  <<ARGM-TMP
here  <<ARGM-LOC
at  
the  
office  
(  
yes  
,  
I  >>ARG1
had  V02
to  
come  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
after  
the  
play  V12
...  
I  >ARG0
love  V01
my  
job  <ARG1
!  
)  
.  

Anyway  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
sure  V02
I  >>ARG0
'd  V01
mentioned  V01
it  <ARG1
before  <ARGM-TMP
but  
yes  >ARGM-DIS
she  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
very  
smart  
girl  <ARG2
.  

As  
a  
result  >>ARGM-CAU
of  
that  
,  
she  >>>ARG0
has  V01
managed  V02
on  
several  >ARGM-ADJ
occasions  V02
over  
the  
years  <<ARGM-TMP
to  
detract  V01
from  
my  
enjoyment  <ARG2
of  
playing  V01
Trivial  
Pursuit  <ARG1
or  
watching  V01
Jeopardy  <ARG1
by  
absolutely  >ARGM-EXT
obliterating  V01
me  <ARG1
(  
The  
girl  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
did  V02
her  
senior  
thesis  <ARG1
on  
Trivia  
)  
.  

Kori  >ARG0
told  V01
me  <ARG2
she  >>ARG0
saw  V01
you  <ARG1
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
at  
Steak  
Night  <ARGM-LOC
and  
introduced  V01
herself  <ARG1
since  
I  >>ARG0
failed  V01
to  
do  V02
so  <ARG1
the  
last  
time  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
went  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
let  V01
you  >ARG0
know  V01
though  <ARGM-DIS
that  
she  >>ARG1
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
offended  V01
this  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
that  
you  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
spell  V01
her  
name  >ARG2
right  V06
in  
the  
email  V01
-  
I  >ARG0
mean  V01
it  >ARG1
's  V01
such  
a  
common  >ARGM-ADJ
spelling  V01
.  

So  
was  
Darren  >ARG0
there  
last  
night  
to  
meet  V02
her  <ARG1
or  
do  V01
you  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
think  V01
they  >>ARG1
'd  >>ARGM-MOD
make  VLV
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
match  V01
?  

She  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
very  
fun  
girl  <ARG2
.  

Hope  V01
you  
day  >>ARG1
is  V03
going  V06
well  <ARGM-MNR
and  
that  
the  
move  V01
to  
30  <ARG2
went  V16
off  
without  
a  
hitch  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Good  
luck  
with  
all  
of  
the  
"  
fun  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
meetings  V03
.  

Shorty  

--  
Due  
to  
the  
lack  V01
of  
response  V01
yesterday  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V03
beginning  V02
to  
worry  V02
about  
your  >ARG0
success  V01
with  
the  
road  >ARGM-LOC
test  V01
...  

I  >>>ARG0
'm  V03
going  V04
to  
assume  V02
that  
you  >>ARG1
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
get  V03
around  <ARG2
to  
it  
.

How  
was  
the  
play  V12
?  

I  >>ARG0
forgot  V01
to  
tell  V01
you  <ARG2
that  
I  >ARG0
saw  V01
your  
friend  <ARG1
on  
a  
re-run  
Jeopardy  <ARGM-LOC
the  
other  
night  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >ARG0
almost  >ARGM-ADV
called  V02
you  <ARG1
but  
it  >ARG1
came  V08
on  
at  
11:30  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Smart  
girl  
.  

I  >ARG0
ran  V07
into  
Corey  <ARG1
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
at  
LW  <ARGM-LOC
s  
and  
I  >>ARG0
am  V03
thinking  V01
this  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
girl  <ARG2
for  
Darren  
.  

Anyway  
,  
lots  
of  
fun  >ARGM-ADJ
meetings  V03
today  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
talk  V01
to  
you  <ARG2
later  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Maybe  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
ignore  V01
the  
sentiment  <ARG1
of  
the  
quote  V01
I  >ARG0
sent  V01
earlier  <ARGM-TMP
...  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
you  >>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
adhering  V02
to  
it  <ARG1
too  
faithfully  <ARGM-MNR
.  

At  
this  
rate  
we  >>>ARG0
may  
have  V02
to  
start  V01
pinning  V01
notes  <ARG1
to  
your  
shirt  <ARG2
to  
remind  V01
you  >ARG0
to  
do  V02
things  <ARG1
.  

However  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
having  V01
driven  V01
with  
you  <ARGM-COM
on  
several  >ARGM-ADJ
occasions  V02
I  >>ARG1
feel  V01
confident  V01
you  >>>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
pass  V07
the  
test  V01
with  
flying  
colors  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

Keep  V04
in  
mind  <ARG2
though  <ARGM-DIS
that  
if  
you  >>ARG1
end  V03
up  
failing  V01
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
let  V01
you  >ARG0
forget  V01
it  <ARG1
(  
and  
,  
as  
we  >>ARG0
have  V01
established  V01
,  
I  >ARG0
have  V03
the  
memory  <ARG1
of  
an  
elephant  
)  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
'll  >>>ARGM-MOD
keep  V02
discussion  V01
of  
me  <ARG1
to  
a  
minimum  <<ARG2
and  
just  >ARGM-ADV
say  V01
that  
things  >>ARG1
are  V01
well  V09
on  
32  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Now  
back  
to  
what  >>ARG1
's  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
important  V01
...  
you  
.  

Thought  V01
you  >>ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
know  V01
that  
the  
Dixie  
Chicks  >>>ARG0
are  V03
coming  V01
back  <ARG4
to  
Houston  
Dec.  <ARGM-TMP
12  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
performing  V01
just  
down  
the  
street  <ARGM-LOC
from  
you  
at  
the  
Compaq  
Center  <ARGM-LOC
...  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
all  <ARGM-ADV
about  
you  <ARG2
and  
your  >ARG0
needs  V01
.

AAAAAGGGHHHHHH  
...  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
found  V03
out  
that  
I  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
take  V01
the  
TX  
driver  
s  
exam  <ARG1
both  
written  
and  
on  
the  
rode  
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
two  
day  >ARGM-TMP
process  V02
and  
all  
because  
I  >ARG0
let  V01
my  
CA  
license  >ARG1
expire  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
I  >ARG0
need  V01
some  <ARG1
of  
your  
organizational  
skills  
.  

I  >>>ARG1
may  >>>ARGM-MOD
try  V01
to  
run  V02
out  <ARGM-DIR
and  
take  VLV
the  
test  V01
this  
afternoon  <ARGM-TMP
while  
I  >>ARG1
get  V03
moved  V01
to  
30  <ARG2
(  
I  >ARG1
better  
not  >ARGM-NEG
fail  V01
it  <ARG2
)  
.  

How  >ARG2
's  V01
life  <ARG1
on  
32  
today  <ARGM-TMP
--  
well  
that  >>ARG1
's  V01
enough  V01
about  
you  <ARG2
let  V01
's  >ARG0
talk  V01
more  <ARGM-EXT
about  
me  <ARG1
.  

There  
is  V02
no  
pleasure  <ARG1
in  
having  V03
nothing  >ARG1
to  
do  V02
;  
the  
fun  V01
is  V01
in  
having  V03
lots  >ARG1
to  
do  V02
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
doing  V02
it  <ARG1
.

Direct  >ARGM-MNR

more  
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
than  
is  V01
currently  >ARGM-TMP
possible  V01

Please  >ARGM-DIS
call  V02

you  >>ARG0
want  V01

Have  V03
a

This

delete  V01
the

notify  V01
us  <ARG1
immediately  <ARGM-TMP

The  
least  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
is  V01
pass  V05
this

along  <ARGM-DIR

Is  V02
there  
anyone  >ARG2

once  
he  >ARG1
's  V01

into  
a

Then  >>ARGM-ADV
it  
's  V01
real  >ARGM-EXT
easy  V05
to  
call  V02
Ben  <ARG1

to  
find  V03
out  
a

The

It  >>ARG1

n't  >ARGM-NEG

A  
.  

Thanks  V01

Do  V01
you  >ARG0
know  V01
the  
address  >ARG2

Do  V01
you  >ARG0
know  V01
if  
Bobby  >ARG0

visitors  <ARG1

Some  >>ARG0

Does  V01
it  
make  VLV
sense  V02
for  
us  >ARG0
to  
set  V03
up  
a  
meeting  V03
with  
you  >ARG0
participating  V01
from  
Buenos  
Aires  <ARGM-LOC
?  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure  V02
we  >ARG0
have  V03
much  >ARG1
to  
tell  V01
them  <ARG2
at  
this  
stage  <ARGM-TMP
-  
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
sure  V02
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
anything  >ARG1
new  
to  
report  V01
but  
if  
you  
do  V01
that  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
fine  V04
with  
me  <ARG2
.

many

possible  
regarding

We  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
meet  V03
Dave  <ARG1
Forster  
and  
his  
team  
among  
others  
.  

We  >>ARG0

like  V02

a

with  
you  <ARG1
as  
a

individually

Please  >ARGM-DIS

Further  
background  
:  

Argentina  >>ARG0
intend  V01
to  
press  V02
ahead  <ARGM-DIR
even  
given  
the  
concern  V01
about  
taxes  <ARG0
,  
etc  
.  

They  >>ARG1
wish  V01
to  
launch  V01
on  
Sept.  <ARGM-TMP

-  
meaning  V01
we  >>>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
to  
be  V03
sending  V01
mailings  <ARG1
sometime  <ARGM-TMP
around  
mid-August

If  
you  >ARG0
need  V01
more  <ARG1
,  
there  
is  V02
a  
proposal  V01
from  
the  
documentation  
committee  <ARG0
for  
a  
new  
alternative  <ARG1
for  
calculating  V01
termination  
amounts  <ARG1
(  
we  >ARG0
heard  V01
about  
it  <ARG1
in  
Amsterdam  <ARGM-LOC
)  
that  >>>R-ARG0
I  >ARG0
think  V01
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
particularly  >ARGM-ADV
attractive  V01
to  
the  
energy  
markets  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
where  >ARG2
this  >ARG1
stands  V04
officially  <ARGM-MNR
(  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
heard  V01
any  
developments  V01
since  
Amsterdam  <<ARGM-TMP
)  
but  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
find  V03
out  
from  
Bob  <ARG2

if  
you  >ARG0

Hi  
everyone  
,  

I  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-TMP
got  V03
of  
the  
phone  <ARG2
with  
Hai  <ARGM-COM
and  
he  >ARG0
told  V01
me  <ARG2
how  >>ARGM-MNR
to  
make  VLV
an  
adjustment  V01
on  
a  
day  
to  
day  
basis  <ARGM-TMP
in  
regards  V01
to  
incorrect  
liquidations  <ARG1
but  
he  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
explained  V01
this  >ARG1
is  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
to  
make  V02
the  
daily  
P&L  
#'s  >ARG2
right  V06
,  
if  
nothing  >>ARG1
were  V03
done  V02
the  
month  >ARG1
end  V01
P&L  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
somehow  >ARGM-MNR
work  V02
out  
because  
adjustments  V01
would  <ARGM-MOD
be  V03
made  VLV
.  

Does  V01
this  >ARG1
mean  V01
that  
for  
June  >>>ARGM-TMP
and  
for  
a  
certain  
portion  
of  
July  
we  >>>ARG0
should  >>>ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
anything  <ARG1
and  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
make  VLV
adjustments  V01
on  
a  
going  V06
forward  <ARG2
basis  <<ARGM-MNR
(  
and  
assume  V02
everything  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
work  V02
out  
at  
month  >ARG1
end  V01
)  
?  

If  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
case  V04
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
someone  >ARG0
to  
walk  V01
me  <ARG1
through  
June  <ARG2
to  
see  V01
if  
the  
numbers  >>ARG0
did  V01
really  >ARGM-ADV
work  V02
themselves  <ARG1
out  <C-V
as  
there  
was  V02
a  
large  >ARGM-ADJ
swing  V03
in  
second  >ARGM-ADJ
order  V02
on  
June  <<ARGM-TMP
29  
that  >>R-ARG1
was  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
adjusted  V01
for  <ARG4
.  

Let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
if  
one  >ARG0
of  
you  
could  >ARGM-MOD

The  
post  
id  >>>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
am  V03
looking  V01
at  <C-ARG1
for  
Calgary  <ARGM-PRP
is  V01
11608  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
am  V03
looking  V01
at  
the  
option  
liquidation  >ARG1
report  V01
and  
all  >ARG1
of  
the  
$  
65  
puts  
are  V01
in  
the  
money  <ARG2
and  
the  
$  
75  
call  >ARG1
is  V01
also  <ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
money  <ARG2
.  

Should  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
all  
the  
liquidation  
values  >>ARG1
from  
the  
beginning  V01
of  
the  
month  <ARG1
be  V01
a  
negative  >ARG0
(  
representing  V01
positive  
liquidation  <ARG1
)  
for  
the  
puts  
?  

The  
liq  
value  >>ARG1
for  
the  
call  
is  V01
CORRECT  V02
.

While

proud  V01
of  
our  
accomplishment  <ARG1

we  >ARG1

Attached  V01
is  V03
a  
rough  
draft  <<ARG1
of  
my  
talking  
points  
for  
a  
panel  >ARG2
I  >ARG1
'll  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
on  <C-ARG2
at  
a  
CEM  >ARG0
conference  V01
in  
SF  <ARGM-LOC
on  
Thursday  
afternoon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Have  V01
distributed  V01
to  
Western  
GA  
team  <ARG2
(  
plus  
Steffes  
)  
for  
comment  V01
and  
thought  V01
you  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
some  <ARG1
,  
too  <ARGM-DIS
.  

Topic  
for  
panel  
,  
"  
PUC  
Priorities  
.  
"  

Goal  >ARG1
is  V01
to  
(  
politely  >ARGM-MNR
?  
)  
refute  V01
Loretta  >ARG0
Lynch  
's  
and  
Carl  
Woods  
'  
continued  >ARGM-PRD
assertions  V02
that  
1  
)  
California  >ARG0
's  
move  V02
to  
deregulate  V01
was  V03
based  V02
solely  <ARGM-ADV
on  
ideology  <ARG2
with  
no  
basis  <ARGM-ADV
in  
fact  
and  
2  
)  
the  
solution  V01
is  V01
to  
turn  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
the  
clock  <ARG1
to  
command  V02
-  
and  
-  
control  V01
regulation  V01
.  

The  
FERC  >ARG0
order  V01
tomorrow  <ARGM-TMP
is  V01
likely  V01
to  
alter  V01
the  
points  <ARG1
somewhat  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Comments  V01
are  V03
much  >ARGM-ADV
appreciated  V02
.

As  
we  >ARG0
discussed  V01
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
,  
Laird  >ARG0
and  
I  
spoke  V01
and  
we  >ARG0
think  V01
that  
the  
presentation  V01
is  V01
good  V02
to  
go  V06
for  
Thursday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
to  
update  V01
the  
numbers  <ARG1
for  
the  
offer  V01
we  <ARG0
made  VLV
to  
S.D.  <<ARG3
last  
week  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

You  >>ARG0
had  V01
mentioned  V01
that  
you  >>ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
want  V01
to  
include  V01
a  
shaped  
product  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
considering  V02
it  <ARG1
?  

Let  V01
us  >ARG0
know  V01
and  
we  >>>ARG0
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
add  V02
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
make  VLV
any  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
changes  V01
you  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
make  VLV
at  
this  
end  
.  

My  >ARG1
flight  V01
gets  V05
into  
S.D.  <ARG2
at  
at  
8:35  <ARGM-TMP
on  
southwest  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Best  
,  

Jeff  

Sandi  >ARG0
sez  V01
it  >>ARG1
's  V03
actually  >ARGM-ADV
happening  V01
at  
10  
AM  <ARGM-TMP
and  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
renewable

Dear  
Justin  

Marly  >ARG0
asked  V02
me  >ARG0
to  
respond  V01
to  
you  <ARG1
.  

As  
you  >ARG0
know  V01
,  
the  
suffix  >>ARG1
ONLINE  
is  V01
purely  
descriptive  <ARG2
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
used  V01
by  
many  
companies  <ARG0
.  

Therefore  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
any  
trade  >ARG1
mark  V02
registration  V02
that  >R-ARG0
incorporates  V02
the  
word  <ARG1
ONLINE  
as  
a  
suffix  <ARGM-PRD
in  
the  
way  >ARGM-MNR
that  >R-ARGM-MNR
you  >ARG0
use  V01
it  <ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
enable  V01
its  
owner  >ARG0
to  
prevent  V01
others  <ARG1
from  
using  V01
the  
word  <ARG1
ONLINE  
.  

Given  V01
the  
above  <ARG1
,  
if  
you  
have  VLV
adequate  >ARGM-EXT
protection  V01
for  
the  
word  >ARG0
ENRON  
(  
which  >R-ARG0
covers  V01
the  
services  V01
that  >R-ARG1
you  >ARG0
offer  V01
on  
-  
line  <ARGM-MNR
as  
well  
as  
your  
core  
activities  
)  
,  
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
that  
another  
application  V02
for  
the  
words  <ARG1
ENRON  
ONLINE  
is  V01
probably  >ARGM-ADV
unnecessary  V01
.  

However  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
use  V01
a  
particular  
logo  <ARG1
for  
the  
on  
-  
line  >ARGM-LOC
service  V01
,  
that  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
registered  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
hope  V01
the  
above  >>ARG1
is  V01
clear  V06
.

Marly

If  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
respond  V01
to  
me  <ARG1
on  
this  
request  V01
,  
thanks  V01

Can  >>ARGM-MOD
one  >>>ARG0
of  
you  
give  VLV
me  >ARG1
a  
quick  >ARGM-ADJ
call  V02
to  
discuss  V01
.  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01
@  
X37047  <ARG2
.  

Thanks  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
believe  V01
we  >>ARG1
are  V03
to  
some  
extent  >ARGM-EXT
already  >ARGM-TMP
protected  V01
with  
"  
Enron  >ARG0
"  
proceeded  V01
with  
anything  <ARG1
,  
but  
EnronOnline  
(  
TM  >ARG0
)  
,  
etc.  
just  >ARGM-ADV
affords  V02
us  <ARG2
more  >ARGM-EXT
protection  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
assume  V02
this  >>ARG1
is  V01
akin  V01
to  
why  >ARGM-CAU
McDonald  >ARG0

Paul  
,  

Can  >>ARGM-MOD
you  >>>ARG0
please  >>ARGM-DIS
give  VLV
me  >ARG1
a  
call  V02
to  
discuss  V01
trademarking  <ARG1
?  

i.e.  >>ARGM-DIS
Are  V03
we  >ARG1
covered  V01
if  
we  >ARG0
proceed  V01
a  
word  <ARG2
with  
"  
Enron  <ARG1
"  
?  

e.g.  
:  
EnronEAuction  
.  

If  
we  >>ARG1
are  V03
covered  V01
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
was  
it  
necessary  V02
to  
register  V02
EnronOnline  <ARG1
?  

Thanks  V01
,

Per  
my  >ARG0

with  
Edmund  <ARG2
this  
morning  <ARGM-TMP

we  >>ARG0

Arnold  
could  >ARGM-MOD

Perhaps  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
them  <ARG2
a  
personal  >ARGM-ADJ
invitation  V01
...  

We  >>ARG0
have  V01
received  V01
the  
amendment  V01
to  
the  
BC  
Gas  
ISDA  
Master  <ARG1
executed  V02
by  
BC  
Gas  <ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
adds  V02
the  
Canadian  
Securities  >ARG1
Representation  V01
,  
so  
we  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  
have  V02
to  
add  V02
the  
rep  <ARG1
into  
every  
confirm  <ARG2
.  

BC  
Gas  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
sign  V02
the  
confirms  <ARG1
with  
the  
rep  <ARGM-MNR
in  
,  
and  
this  >>ARG0
has  V01
caused  V01
much  
difficulties  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
am  V03
going  V04
to  
count  V02
it  >ARG1
as  
signed  V01
,  
since  
BC  
Gas  >>ARG0
has  V01
signed  V02
,  
but  
we  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
need  V01
it  >>ARG1
to  
be  V03
signed  V01
by  
ECC  <ARG0
.  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
get  V04
it  >ARG1
signed  V01
ASAP  <ARGM-TMP
and  
back  
to  
me  
.  

Much  >ARGM-EXT
thanks  V01
.  

We  >>ARG0
have  V01
received  V01
the  
executed  >ARGM-PRD
Amendment  V01

with

it  >ARG0

&

It  
appears  V02
you  >ARG0
missed  V02
some  
cpys  <ARG1
on  
the  
referenced  V04
list  <ARG1
because  
Tom  >ARG0
had  V04
the  
freeze  
panel  
button  <ARG1
on  <ARG1
,  
and  
you  >>ARG0
probably  >>ARGM-ADV
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see  V01
them  <ARG1
at  
first  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  
did  V01
n't  
either  
until  
I  >ARG0
clicked  V01
on  
the  
down  
button  <ARG1
and  
they  >ARG1
popped  V03
up  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
minute  <ARG1
,  
I  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
give  VLV
me  >ARG1
a

I  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
come  V01
around  <ARGM-DIR
and  
show  V01
you  <ARG2
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
unfreeze  V01
the

.  

I  >>ARG0
spoke  V01
to  
Edmund  <ARG2
to  
get  V01
the  
scoop  <ARG1
on  
what  >>>ARG1
we  >>>ARG0

going  V04
to  
be  V03
doing  V02
on  
the  
confirms  <ARG2
for  
Credit  
Derivatives  
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
said  V01
that  
his  >ARG0
current  >ARGM-TMP
understanding  V01
is  V01
that  
all  >>ARG1
of  
the  
confirms  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
done  V02
out  
of  
London  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
communicated  V01
that  <ARG1
to  
Bob  <ARG2
Bowen  
.  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
said  V01
that

120  
people  >ARG0

The

in  
my  >ARG0
earlier  >ARGM-TMP

(

continuing

such  <ARG2
that

confident  V01
of

sufficient  
accurate

understand  V01
how  >>>ARG2

to  
get  V05

I  >>ARG0
plan  V01
on  
taking  V01

office  <ARG0
that  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
compete  V01
at  
this

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
plan  V01
on  
trying  V01
to  
retake  V01
the

.  

Due  
to  
my  
disability  >ARGM-CAU
,  
this  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
monumental  >ARGM-ADJ
task  V01
,  
but  
I  >>>ARG0
am  V01
determined  V02
to  
prove  V01
to  
the  
Admissions  V02
committment  <ARG0
that  
I  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
do  VLV
the  
work  V01
at  
The  
Texas  
University  
Graduate  
School  <ARGM-LOC
of  
Business  
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
continue  V01
our

creating  V01
an  
Energy  >ARG1

-  
wide  >>ARG1
and  
investment  >ARGM-MNR

contacts  V01
that  
I  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
help  V01
raise  V02
capital  <ARG1
for  
the

I  >>>ARG0
am  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
interested  V01
in  
energy  >ARG1

finance  V01

think  V01

Thanks  V01

been  V01
a

Also  >>>ARGM-DIS

I  >>ARG0
want  V01

that  
I  >ARG0

exactly  
how  
you  >ARG0
propose  V01
valuing  <ARG1
the

how  >>ARGM-MNR
this

would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
booked  V01

As  
such  >ARGM-ADV

Has  V01
Don  >ARG0
provided  V01
the  
fixed  >ARGM-PRD

This  
stream  V02
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
covering  V01
both  
P&I  <ARG1
and  
not  
just  
principal

Yvan  >ARGM-DIS

please  >ARGM-DIS
provide  V01
answers  V01
to  
these

via

so  
that  
their

Thank  V01
you  <ARG1

very  
much  <ARGM-EXT

help  V01
thus  
far  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Furthermore  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
reiterate  V01
that  
RAC  
's  
goal  >>ARG1
,  
prior  
to  
quoting  V01
any  
credit  
reserve  <ARG2
,  
is  V01
to  
be  V01
100  
%  >ARGM-EXT
confident  V01
that  
:  
(  
i  
)  
the  
methodology  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
is  V03
being  V03
employed  V02
is  V01
consistent  V01
among  
the  
internal  
groups  <ARGM-ADV

and  
(  
ii  
)  
the  
inherent  
value  >>>ARG1
of  
the  
price  
risk  V01
management  V01
contracts  
matches  V01
.  

This  >ARG0
enables  V01
RAC  >ARG0
to  
manage  V01
the  
associated  >ARGM-PRD
risk  V01
during  
the  
life  <<ARGM-TMP

both  
effectively  <<<ARGM-MNR

appropriately  
.

Article  >>>ARG0

of  
the

Agreement  V01
(  
which  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
am  V03
sending  V01
to  
you  <ARG2
separately  <ARGM-MNR
)  
with  
ECS  <<<ARGM-COM
obligates  V01
ECS  >>ARG0
to  
"  
work  V01
in  
good  
faith  <ARGM-MNR
with  
CDEC  <ARG3
"  
to  
establish  V01
an  
automated

that  >>R-ARG0

automatically  >>ARGM-ADV
have  V01

us  <ARG1
to  
peak  >ARGM-ADJ
loading  V01
conditions  <<ARG2
on  
CDEC  
's

.  

We  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
pretty  
good  
idea  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
signed  V02
the  
contract  <ARG1
that

be  V01
able  V01
to  
complete  V01
that  <ARG1
by  
the  
contract  
start  
date  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
negotiated  V01
a  
fall  
back  >ARGM-ADJ
plan  V01
under  
which  
ECS  >>>ARG0
is  V03
obligated  V01
to  
"  
assist  V01
[  
Transwestern  <ARG1
]  
in  
developing  V02
a  
manual  
system  >ARG0
to  
accomplish  V01
the  
same  
result  <ARG1
and  
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
hold  V02
harmless  V01
and  
keep  V02
[  
Transwestern  <ARG1
]  
whole  <ARG2
for  
all  
cost  >ARG1
and  
expenses  
"  
associated  V01
with  
the  
manual  
system  <ARG2
.  

We  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
fight  V01
with  
them  <ARG1
about  
who  >ARG0
owes  V01
the  
$  >ARG1
200  
k  
that  >R-ARG1
James  >ARG0
mentions  V01
below  <ARGM-LOC
based  
on  
their  
failure  <<ARGM-CAU
to  
"  
assist  V01
"  
us  <ARG1
in  
managing  V01
the  
cost  <ARG1
.  

In  
the  
mean  
time  >ARGM-TMP
,  
we  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
make  V02
sure  V01
that  
we  >>>ARG0
are  V03
doing  V02
everything  <ARG1
we  
can  
to  
get  V01
a  
handle  V01
on  
the  
situation  <ARG1
to  
mitigate  V01
future  
costs  <ARG1
.  

Do  V01
we  >ARG0
have  V03
someone  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
is  V03
watching  V01
this  <ARG1
out  
there  <ARGM-LOC
?  

We  >>ARG0
are  V03
running  V01
so  
full  
tilt  <ARGM-EXT
on  
TW  <ARG4
that  
we  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
as  
much  
flexibiltiy  <ARG1
to  
manage  V01
this  
situation  <ARG1
as  
we  >ARG0
expected  V01
,  
but  
let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
what  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
.  

James  >>ARG0
had  V01
heard  V01
that  
one  
hold  
up  V_
was  V01
the  
absence  V01
of  
a  
confidentiality  >ARG1
agreement  V01
--  
I  >ARG0
guess  V01
between  
ECS  <ARG1
and  
Transwestern  
--  
that  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
permit  V01
ECS  >ARG0
to  
communicate  V01
to  
us  <ARG2
the  
details  <ARG1
on  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
access  V01
teh  
key  
info.  <ARG1
from  
CDEC  <ARGM-DIR
.  

That  >ARG1
sounds  V01
like  
a  
BS  >ARGM-ADJ
excuse  V02
from  
ECS  <ARG0
,  
but  
it  
that  >ARG1
's  V01
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
saying  V01
,  
let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
and  
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
figure  V05
out  
a  
solution  V01
.  

Thanks  V01

Would  >>ARGM-MOD
you  >>ARG0
please  >>ARGM-DIS
contact  V01
Gerald  <ARG1
Nemec  
and  
review  V01
the  
Gallup  
Compression  
Service  
Contract  <ARG1
in  
respect  V02
to  
the  
Load  >ARG1
Control  V01
Management  V01
.  

My  >ARG0
understanding  V01
was  V01
that  
ECS  >>ARG0
was  V01
to  
provide  V01
a  
means  >ARGM-MNR
to  
access  V01
CDEC  
's  
online  
profile  <ARG1
in  
order  
for  
us  >>ARG0
to  
make  VLV
a  
decision  V01
to  
avoid  V01
running  V01
the  
compressor  <ARG1
during  
CDEC  
's  
peak  
load  
periods  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG0
have  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
received  V01
access  V01
to  
this  
information  <ARG1
which  >>ARG1
has  V01
resulted  V01
so  
far  <ARGM-TMP
in  
additional  
electric  
cost  <ARG2
of  
$  
200,987.33  
for  
the  
period  <ARGM-TMP
of  
July  
through  
September  
.  

Additional  
cost  >>>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
incurred  V01
for  
the  
remainder  <ARGM-TMP
of  
this  
year  
,  
that  >>>R-ARG1
I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
not  >>ARGM-NEG
been  V01
able  V01
to  
review  V01
yet  <ARGM-TMP
.  

This  
cost  >>ARG1
is  V03
averaging  V01
$  <ARG2
79,000  
per  
month  
if  
we  >>ARG0
continue  V01
to  
run  V01
the  
compressor  <ARG1
as  
we  
have  V01
in  
August  <<ARGM-ADV
and  
September  
.  

Good  
point  
,  
but  
I  >ARG1
'm  V01
comfortable  <ARG2
we  >>ARG1
're  V03
covered  V01
because  
our  
bidders  >>ARG0
were  V03
all  >ARGM-ADV
bidding  V01
on  
a  
chunk  <ARG1
of  
capacity  
and  
primary  
points  
.  

They  >>>ARG1
are  V03
deemed  V01
to  
be  V01
on  
notice  V03
that  
they  >ARG0
had  V03
alternate  
point  >ARG2
rights  V05
(  
it  >ARG1
s  V01
in  
the  
tariff  V01
)  
and  
if  
they  >>ARG0
wanted  V01
to  
submit  V01
a  
bid  V01
that  >R-ARG0
had  V03
a  
different  
rate  <ARG1
for  
primaries  
and  
alternates  
,  
they  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
done  V02
so  <ARG1
.  

None  
of  
them  
did  V01
,  
and  
most  
importantly  
,  
the  
winning  
bidders  
did  V01
not  
.  

Our  >ARG0
letter  >ARG1
agreement  V01
simply  >ARGM-ADV
memorializes  V01
that  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
charge  V01
the  
same  
negotiated  
rate  <ARG1
whether  
the  
gas  >ARG1
flows  V01
on  
primaries  <ARGM-LOC
or  
alternates  
.  

I  >ARG0
assume  V02
from  
your  
message  <ARGM-CAU
you  >ARG1
are  V01
OK  <ARG2
with  
this  
and  
they  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
get  V04
it  >ARG1
nailed  V02
down  
?  

DF  

I  >>>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-TMP
got  V03
done  V08
looking  V01
at  
the  
underlying  
contract  
language  <ARG1
as  
set  V17
forth  
in  
the  
pro  >ARGM-ADJ
forma  
service  >ARG1
agreement  V01
in  
the  
tariff  V01
and  
it  >ARG0
specifically  >ARGM-MNR
says  V01
that  
the  
max  
rate  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
apply  V02
unless  
a  
discount  V01
or  
negotiated  
rate  
has  V01
been  V03
agreed  V01
to  <C-ARG1
.  

My  >ARG1
concern  V01
with  
adding  V02
the  
language  <ARG1
below  
is  V01
,  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
it  
be  V03
argued  V01
that  
not  
everyone  >ARG0
knew  V01
the  
rate  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
or  
could  >ARGM-MOD
apply  V02
at  
any  
point  <ARGM-TMP
,  
since  
we  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
stated  V01
Topack  <ARG1
and  
Needles  
and  
if  
they  >ARG0
knew  V01
they  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
bid  V01
a  
different  
rate  <ARG2
??

In  
discussion  V01
with  
Dave  <ARG2
,  
we  >ARG0
thought  V01
it  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
good  V02
to  
put  V03
this  <ARG1
together  <ARG2

as  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
,  
the  
questions  V01
I  >ARG0
thought  V01
of  <C-ARG1
got  V03
kinda  >ARGM-EXT
long  V03
-  
but  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
we  >ARG0
need  V01
answers  V01
for  
all  <ARG1
of  
them  
.  

One  
thought  V01
is  V01
to  
have  V03
just  
the  
agenda  <ARG1
as  
a  
couple  
topics  <ARGM-PRD
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
lead  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR

the  
first  >ARGM-TMP

as  
I  >>ARG0

I  >ARG0
believe  V01
you  >ARG0
got  V01
a  
copy  V01
of  
the  
John  
Sommer  
letter  >>ARG1
to  
producers  
dated  V01
Jan  <ARG2
6  
that  >R-ARG1
MKM  
's  
spies  >ARG0
intercepted  V01
.  

She  >>ARG0
forwarded  V01
the  
Sommer  <ARG1
letter  
to  
Stan  <ARG2
and  
discussed  V01
it  <ARG1
with  
him  <ARG2
.  

Dari  >>>ARG0
and  
I  
vented  V01
our  >ARG1
aggravation  V01
by  
drafting  V01
the  
attached  
letter  >ARG0
to  
Gibson  
and  
Kyle  
complaining  V01
of  
Sommer  
's  
duplicity  <ARG1
,  
but  
after  
tempers  >ARG1
cooled  V01
,  
MKM  >>>ARG0
and  
I  
decided  V01
not  >>ARGM-NEG
to  
send  V01
it  <ARG1

Stan  <ARG2
or  
urge  V01
him  >ARG0

send  V01
a  
written  >ARGM-PRD

As  
it  >ARG1
stands  V04
,  
MKM  >>ARG0

I  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
probably  >>ARGM-ADV
bring  V02
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
with  
Sommer  <ARGM-COM
in  
OK  
City  <ARGM-LOC

strongly  >ARGM-MNR
suggest  V01
the  
importance  <ARG1
of  
coordinated  >ARGM-PRD
communication  V01
to  
the  
producers  <ARG2

Stan  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
bring  V02
the  
letter  <ARG1
up  <C-V
orally  <ARGM-MNR
next

's  V01
on  
the

Jim  

We  >>ARG0
do  V01
need  V01
a  
formal  >ARGM-ADJ
plan  V01
.  

We  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
working  V01
closely  
together  <ARGM-MNR
to  
identify  V01
the  
issues  V02
as  
they  >ARG2
develop  V01
and  
propose  V01
solutions  V01
.  

Doug  >>>ARG0
has  V01
been  V03
providing  V01
us  <ARG2
with  
the  
necessary  
specific  
market  
information  <ARG1
.  

We  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V01
successful  V01
in  
communicating  V01
that  
information  <ARG1
to  
the  
new  
commissioners  <ARG2
and  
Ercot  
and  
seeking  V01
resolution  V01
.  

The  
commission  >ARG1
is  V01
definitely  <ARGM-ADV
more  
responsive  <ARG2
to  
market  
participants  >>>ARG0
that  >>>R-ARG0
are  V03
articulating  V01
the  
issue  V02
,  
providing  V01
specific  
examples  <ARG1
and  
proposing  V01
the  
solution  V01
.  

Grand  
-  
standing  >>ARG1
is  V03
ignored  V01
.  

Those  >>>ARG1
who  >>>R-ARG0
show  V02
up  
with  
complaints  V01
but  
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
point  V01
to  
specifics  <ARG2
are  V03
virtually  >ARGM-ADV
ignored  V01
.  

Those  >>>ARG1
who  >>>R-ARG0
show  V02
up  
and  
complain  V01
,  
but  
are  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
participating  V01
in  
the  
working  
groups  <ARG1
and  
the  
daily  >ARGM-TMP
Ercot  >ARG1
phone  >ARGM-MNR
calls  V02
,  
board  >ARG0
meetings  V03
,  
etc.  
are  V03
ignored  V01
.  

Doug  >>>ARG0
and  
I  
met  V03
with  
the  
Chairman  <ARG1
of  
PUCT  
and  
have  V01
had  VLV
subsequent  >ARGM-TMP
conversations  V01
.  

Thane  >ARG0
and  
I  
also  >ARGM-DIS
visited  V02
with  
him  <ARG1
.  

Pat  >>>ARG0
Wood  
made  VLV
a  
phone  >ARGM-MNR
call  V02
to  
Tom  <ARG1
Noel  
and  
told  V01
him  >ARG0
to  
get  V04
the  
Texas  
market  >ARG1
fixed  V02
.  

(  
Even  
though  
he  >ARG0
has  V03
bigger  
things  >ARG1
to  
do  V02
in  
D.C.  <ARGM-LOC
,  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
his  
legacy  <ARG2
and  
he  >ARG0
recognizes  V02
that  
if  
deregulation  V01
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
work  V09
in  
Texas  <ARGM-LOC
,  
the  
repercussions  V01
could  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
global  <ARG2
.  
)  

Chairman  >>ARG1
Sibley  
and  
Chairman  
Wolens  
(  
of  
the  
Texas  
legislature  
)  
are  V03
also  >ARGM-DIS
engaged  V01
in  
market  >ARG2
developments  V01
.  

We  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
working  V01
with  
the  
State  
Affairs  
legislative  
committee  <ARG3
and  
keeping  V02
them  >ARG1
apprised  V01
.  

There  
is  V02
an  
Electric  
Restructuring  
Committee  >ARG0
hearing  V02
scheduled  V01
for  
September  <ARG3
6th  
or  
7th  
.  

The  
forum  >>>ARG1
is  V03
expected  V01
to  
be  V01
invited  >ARGM-PRD
testimony  V01
only  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

Those  >>ARG1
currently  >ARGM-TMP
listed  V01
as  
invitees  <ARGM-PRD
are  V01
PUCT  
Commissioners  
and  
Ercot  
's  
Sam  <ARG2
Jones  
and  
Tom  
Noel  
.  

The  
hearing  V02
is  V03
focused  V01
on  
the  
pilot  <ARG2
and  
we  >ARG0
have  V03
an  
opportunity  <ARG1
to  
provide  V01
some  
probing  >ARGM-ADJ
questions  V01
for  <<ARG2
Wolens  <<ARG2
to  
direct  V01
to  
Sam  <ARG2
and  
Tom  
.  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
that  
Sibley  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
candidate  <ARG2
for  
Lt.  
Governor  
,  
there  
is  V02
more  
freedom  >>ARG0
to  
open  V03
up  
and  
ask  V01
some  
difficult  >ARGM-ADJ
questions  V01
.  

Thane  >>>ARG2
is  V01
in  
Austin  <ARG2
on  
Friday  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
is  V01
available  V02
by  
phone  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
on  
a  
plane  <ARG2
to  
Houston  
at  
8:00  
a.m  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
we  >ARG0
find  V01
another  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
that  >R-ARG1
works  V09
for  
us  <ARG2
to  
meet  V03
?  

Thane  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
an  
Ercot  
PRS  >ARG0
meeting  V03
Friday  <ARGM-TMP
from  
9:30  <ARGM-TMP
until  
3:00  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG2
am  V01
available  V02
after  
Rick  >ARG0
's  
Friday  >ARGM-TMP
budget  >ARGM-ADJ
meeting  V03
...  
are  V01
you  >ARG2
available  V02
then  <ARGM-TMP
?  

You  >>ARG1
are  V01
right  V06
,  
we  >>ARG0
do  V01
need  V01
a  
formal  >ARGM-ADJ
plan  V01
,  
Thane  >>ARG0
has  V01
started  V01
an  
initial  
draft  <ARG1
.  

Thanks  V01

Thane

Walking  V01
out  <ARG2
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
,  
Kevin  >ARG0
Presto  
indicated  V01
that  
there  
were  V02
games  >>ARG1
being  V03
played  V01
in  
ERCOT  <ARGM-LOC
with  
the  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
market  >ARG0
rules  V01
and  
prices  V01
in  
certain  
markets  <ARGM-LOC
were  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
reflective  <ARG2
of  
working  
markets  
.  

Enron  >>>ARG0
needs  V01
to  
use  V01
this  
situation  <ARG1
to  
quickly  >ARGM-MNR
get  V01
our  
viewpoints  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-DIR
into  
the  
PUCT  
and  
ERCOT  <ARG4
ISO  <ARG4
on  
what  >>ARG0
is  V03
driving  V02
these  
problems  <ARG1
and  
our  >ARG0
proposed  >ARGM-PRD
fixes  V02
.  

If  
ERCOT  >ARG0
goes  V02
the  
way  V01
of  
California  <ARG1
-  
either  
due  
to  
market  
power  <<ARGM-CAU
or  
poor  >ARGM-ADJ
market  >ARG0
design  >ARG1
rules  V01
-  
it  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
bad  
day  <ARG2
for  
deregulation  V01
and  
for  
Pat  
Wood  
.  

As  >ARGM-EXT
important  V01
,  
the  
new  
PUCT  
Commissioners  >ARG0
need  V01
some  
help  V01
right  
now  <<ARGM-TMP
in  
messaging  V01
the  
market  <ARG2
.  

Let  V01
's  >ARG0
get  V04
them  >ARG0
to  
support  V01
constructive  >ARGM-ADJ
solutions  V01
that  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
make  V01
a  
real  >ARGM-ADJ
difference  V02
.  

Jean  >ARGM-DIS
and  
Thane  
,  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
that  
we  >ARG0
need  V01
a  
FORMAL  >ARGM-ADJ
PLAN  V01
on  
what  >ARG1
to  
do  V02
over  
the  
next  
3  
-  
6  
months  <ARGM-TMP
to  
leverage  V01
this  
situation  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
discuss  V01
this  <ARG1
with  
you  <ARG2
on  
Friday  
am  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG1
am  V01
free  V04
at  
8  
am  <ARGM-TMP
on  
Friday  
before  
Rick  >ARG0
's  
budget  >ARGM-ADJ
meeting  V03
.  

Jim  

FYI  
.  

You  >>ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
want  V01
to  
discuss  V01
with  
Becky  <ARG2

As  
an  
outgrowth  >>>ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
meeting  V03
Leslie  <ARG0
and  
I  
had  VLV
with  
Scott  <<ARG1
and  
Hunter  
a  
couple  
of  
weeks  
ago  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
we  >>ARG0
have  V01
begun  V01
work  V01
to  
develop  V02
an  
electronic  
tool  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
allow  V01
us  >ARG0
to  
provide  V01
ongoing  
summaries  <ARG1
of  
FERC  
gas  
activities  
,  
and  
possibly  
electric  
activities  
,  
in  
a  
format  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
linked  V01
to  
the  
Fundamentals  
intranet  
site  >ARG1
used  V01
by  
the  
traders  <ARG0
.  

We  >ARG0
envision  V01
a  
format  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
provide  V01
a  
brief  >ARGM-TMP
summary  <ARG1
and  
analysis  V01
of  
the  
order  V02
,  
filing  V01

etc.  
with  
a  
link  <<<ARGM-ADJ
to  
the  
source  
document  
as  
well  
for  
those  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V01
more  
detailed  
information  <ARG1
.  

This  >ARG2
would  >ARGM-MOD
replace  V01
the  
paper  >ARGM-MNR
copies  V01
you  >>ARG0
and  
your  
people  
are  V03
currently  >ARGM-TMP
getting  V01
.  

Many  
details  >>>ARG1
remain  V01
to  
be  V03
worked  V02
out  
,  
but  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
keep  V02
you  >ARG1
advised  V01
.  

In  
the  
meantime  >ARGM-TMP
,  
could  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
please  >ARGM-DIS
provide  V01
a  
contact  >>ARG2
on  
your  >ARG1
side  V01
with  
whom  >R-ARG2
we  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
discuss  V01
technical  >ARGM-ADJ

Peter  >>ARG0

looking  V01
currently  <ARGM-TMP

a

I  >ARG0
met  V02
him  <ARG1
last

Industry  
Advance  
with  
Mathematics  
society  <ARG0
at  
the  
University  <ARGM-LOC
of  
Houston  
.  

The  
application  V02
of  
recent  >ARGM-TMP
developments  V01
in  
optimization  
theory  <ARG2
and  
numerical  
methods  
can  >ARGM-MOD
help  V01
Enron  >>ARG0
to  
improve  V01
further  
efficiency  <ARG1
of  
our  
pipeline  
system  
and  
reduce  V01
the  
consumption  V01
of  
compressor  
fuel  <ARG1
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
,  
let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
if  
you  >ARG1
interested  V01
in  
introducing  V01
Peter  <ARG1
to

you  <ARG1
briefly  <ARGM-TMP
afterwards  <ARGM-TMP

Getting  V05
out

If  
Sam  >ARG0
's  
description  V01
below  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
GCP  >ARG1
procedure  V01
is  V01
correct  V02
,  
it  >ARG0
looks  V02
to  
me  <ARG2
like  
something  >>>ARG1
needs  V01
to  
be  V03
changed  V01
.  

The  
difficulty  >ARG1
lies  V07
in  
the  
fact  <ARG2
that  
the  
confirmation  
system  >ARG0
reads  V01
the  
counterparty  
's  
name  <ARG3
from  
Global  
Counterparty  <ARG1
.  

Since  
divisions  >ARG1
of  
companies  
are  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
legal  
entities  >>ARGM-CAU
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
the  
power  >ARGM-ADV
to  
contract  V02
in  
their  
own  
names  <ARGM-MNR
.  

If  
the  
correct  
legal  
name  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
in  
Global  
Counterparty  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
confirmation  V01
goes  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR
with  
the  
wrong  
legal  
name  <ARGM-MNR
on  
it  
seriously  >ARGM-ADV
compromising  V02
the  
contract  <ARG1
itself  
.  

That  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
source  <ARG2
of  
Tana  >ARG1
's  
concern  V01
regarding  
the  
correct  >ARGM-ADJ
entering  V02
of  
divisions  V02
in  
the  
system  <<ARG2
.  

My  >ARG0
suggestion  V01
is  V01
that  
Global  
Counterparty  >ARG0
use  V01
the  
same  
name  >>ARG2
that  >>R-ARG2
the  
customer  >>ARG0
has  V01
signed  V01
on  
the  
EnronOnline  >ARG2
Password  >ARG1
Application  V01
--  
my  >ARG0
understanding  V01
is  V01
that  
the  
EnronOnline  
team  >ARG0
returns  V04
inappropriate  >ARGM-ADJ
Applications  V01
to  
the  
customer  <<ARG2
until  
they  >>ARG1
are  V03
correctly  >ARGM-MNR
completed  V01
.  

In  
this  
particular  >ARGM-ADJ
case  V03
since  
the  
counterparty  >>>ARG0
is  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
not  >ARGM-NEG
allowed  V01
to  
transact  V01
on  
EnronOnline  <ARGM-MNR
almost  
a  
month  
after  
sending  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
their  >ARG0
application  V01
they  >>>ARG0
are  V01
understandably  <ARGM-MNR
upset  <ARG2
and  
are  V03
now  >ARGM-TMP
complaining  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
appreciate  V02
it  <ARG1
if  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
get  V04
this  
one  >ARG1
fixed  V02
today  <<ARGM-TMP

,  
if  
you  >>ARG0
have  V03
any  
problem  <ARG1
with  
changing  V01
the

my  >ARG0
understanding  V01
with  
the

you  >ARG0
need  V01
anything  <ARG1
else

Diane

I  >ARG0
agree  V01
also  <ARGM-DIS
,  
but  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V02
all  
the  
parties  <ARG1
or  
complications  V01
involved  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

Should  >ARGM-MOD
there  
be  V02
a  
(  
groan  
)  
meeting  V03
on  
this  <ARGM-CAU
?  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
please  >ARGM-DIS
help  V01
with  
this  
one  <ARG1
?  

I  >ARG0
agree  V01
with  
what  >>ARG2
the  
concern  V01
is  V01
below  <ARGM-LOC
.  

We  >ARG0
have  V03
GIS  
ids  <ARG1
,  
and  
Eid  
(  
external  
id  
-  
just  
like  
GIS  
id  
)  
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
we  >>ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
try  V01
to  
migrate  V01
to  
one  <ARG2
of  
these  
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
what  
type  
of  
statement  V01
I  
should  
make  VLV
back

the

.  

Thanks  V01

To  
Whom  >ARG0
It  >ARG1
May  >ARGM-MOD
Concern  V02
:  

Through  
TV  >ARGM-MNR
and  
newspapers  
,  
I  >ARG0
hear  V01
constantly  <ARGM-TMP
about  
identity  
fraud  >ARG0
using  V01
stolen  V01
social  
security  
information  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG1
am  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
concerned  V01
about  
this  
issue  V02
.  

I  
have  VLV
the  
following  >ARGM-PRD
suggestion  V01
for  
our  
company  <ARG2
.  

Since  
Enron  
's  
employees  >>ARG2
are  V03
assigned  V01
an  
SAP  
identification  
numbers  <ARG1
(  
P  
number  
)  
and  
an  
HR  
number  
,  
could  >ARGM-MOD
Enron  >ARG0
as  
a  
company  
use  V01
these  
IDs  <ARG1
instead  
of  
the  
SS  
numbers  <ARGM-ADV
?  

This  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
safer  V01
for  
all  
employees  <ARG1
.  

For  
example  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG1
am  V01
concerned  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
buy  V01
the  
monthly  
bus  
passes  <ARG1
and  
I  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
fill  V05
in  
my  
SS  
number  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
feel  V01
secure  <ARG1
at  
all  <ARGM-EXT
to  
see  V01
my  
SS  <ARG1
in  
so  
many  
databases  <ARGM-LOC
at  
Enron  
,  
especially  
when  
some  
databases  >ARG1
are  V01
from  
third  
-  
parties  >ARG0
(  
out  >ARGM-DIR
-  
sourcing  V02
)  
.  

We  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
use  V01
our  
badge  
number  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
instead  
of  
our  
SS  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
your  
organization  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
help  V01
the  
Enron  
employees  >>ARG1
feel  V01
safer  V01
about  
the  
safeguard  <ARG0
of  
their  
SS  
number  
.  

Please  >>ARGM-ADJ
calendar  V01
and  
print  V01
for  
my  
files  <ARG2
on  
this  
meeting  V03
.  

Thanks  V01

Michelle  

Michelle  
,  

Two  
in  
one  
day  
.  

We  >ARG0
understand  V01
that  
the  
pipe  
fitters  >>>ARG0
are  V03
also  >ARGM-DIS
planning  V01
to  
picket  V01
the  
Lake  
Worth  
,  
Florida  
project  <ARG1
as  <ARGM-DIS
well  
.  

Our  
execution  
team  >>>ARG1
needs  V01
to  
get  VLV
some  
guidance  V01
and  
planning  V01
for  
this  
picketing  V01
should  >ARGM-MOD
it  >ARG0
interfere  V01
with  
the  
progress  V01
of  
the  
work  V01
.  

In  
that  
respect  V02
,  
we  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
dial  V01
in  <ARGM-PRD
Rick  <ARG1
Johnson  
and  
Olgletree  
to  
plan  V01
and  
communicate  V01
that  
plan  V01
to  
the  
execution  
team  <<ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
the  
first  >ARGM-TMP
step  V01
is  V01
a  
call  V02
between  
yourself  <ARG0
,  
me  
,  
Mark  
Stubley  
and  
Mike  
Indivero  
.  

And  
then  
another  
call  V02
with  
all  
folks  <ARG0
or  
a  
meeting  V03
at  
the  
jobsite  <ARGM-LOC
to  
lay  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR
the  
plan  V01
.  

Barbara  >ARGM-DIS
,  
please  >ARGM-DIS
organize  V01
a  
call  V02
for  
Mike  <ARG2
,  
Michelle  
,  
Mark  
Stubley  
and  
me  
.

David

I  >>>ARG1
have  V01
been  V03
advised  V01
by  
our  
Construction  
Manager  <ARG0
,  
Mr.  
Joe  
Osler  
that  
while  
he  >>ARG0
was  V03
visiting  V01
the  
City

Lake  
Worth  
Building  
Planning  
and  
Zoning  
dept  <ARG1
regarding  
our  
permit  
status  <ARGM-CAU
he  >ARG0
learned  V01
that  
the  
pipefitters  >>>ARG0
have  V01
inquired  V01
about  
permit  >ARG1
requirements  V01
to  
picket  V01
our  
site  <ARG1
.  

Apparently  >ARGM-ADV
the  
City  >ARG0
informed  V01
them  <ARG1
that  
no  
permit  >>ARG1
is  V03
required  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
heard  V01
that  
the  
pipefitters  >>ARG0
have  V01
established  V01
a  
picket  
line  <ARG1
at  
the  
Payne  
Creek  
site  <ARGM-LOC
today  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
local  
legal  
counsel  >C-ARG0
to  
assist  V01
us  <ARG1
in  
this  
regard  V01
.  

Mike  >ARGM-DIS
Indivero  
,  
I  >ARG0
understand  V01
that  
Mr.  
Mike  
Croall  
's  
release  
date  >ARG1
from  
NEPCO  
is  V01
Oct  <ARG2

Please  >ARGM-DIS
advise  V01
as  
to  
who  >>ARG2
his  >ARG1
replacement  V01
is  V01
and  
their

a

I  >>ARG0

LA.  >>ARG1

about  >ARGM-ADV

thing  >>>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1

n't  >ARGM-NEG
show  V02

the

Joseph  >>ARG0

me  <ARG1
last

say  V01
he  >>ARG0
had  V01
finally  >ARGM-TMP
reviewed  V01
the

ISDA  
doc  <ARG1
with  
all  
agreed  >ARGM-PRD
changes  V01
put  V01
in  <ARG2
and  
lined  V03
from  
original  <ARGM-ADV
.  

He  >>ARG0
faxed  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
you  <ARG2

will  >ARGM-MOD
have  V04
the  
original  >ARG1
Fedexed  V01
overnight  <ARGM-MNR

Hope  V01
you  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
review  V01
it  <ARG1
today  <ARGM-TMP
.  

S&S  >>ARG0
has  V01
again  >ARGM-TMP
asked  V01
about  
the  
gtee  >ARG1
and  
l/c  
wording  V01
.  

They  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
anything  >>ARG0
from  
us  
in  
writing  V01
confirming  V01
the  
agreed  >ARGM-PRD

.  

Joe  >ARG0
asked  V02
that  
you  >ARG0
fax  V01
the  
revised  >ARGM-ADJ
gtee  >ARG1
wording  V01
that  >>>R-ARG1
has  V01
been  V03
agreed  V01
(  
I  >ARG0
believe  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
our  >>ARG0
agreeing  V01
to  
reduce  V01
the  
claim  
period  <ARG1
from  
15  
days  <ARG3
down  <ARG4
to  
5  
)  
and  
the  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
l/c  >ARG1
wording  V01
(  
drops  V05
the  
2  
day  
period  <ARG1
to  
replace  V01
an  
l/c  <ARG1
with  
a  
different  
bank  <ARG2
if  
the  
first  >>ARG0
refuses  V01
to  
pay  V01
)  
.  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
we  >ARG0
talked  V01
about  
these  
issues  V02
earlier  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
Tiger  
's  
lawyers  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
get  V04
everything  >ARG1
agreed  V01
in  
writing  V01
now  <<<ARGM-TMP
so  
final  
docs  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
issued  V01
for  
signing  <ARGM-PRP
,  
even  
if  
we  >ARG1

Proposal  V01
.  

We  >ARG0
believe  V01
it  >ARG0
addresses  V02
many  <ARG1
of  
the  
issues  V02
and  
concerns  V01
you  >>ARG0
have  V01
raised  V01
in  
the  
workshops  <ARGM-LOC
.  

As  
an  
overview  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
this  
proposal  V01
:  
*  
Maintains  V01
the  
basic  
Gas  
Accord  
structure  <ARG1
in  
place  <ARGM-LOC
today  <ARGM-TMP
for  
the  
period  <ARGM-TMP
2003  
to  
2007  
.  
*  

*  
Offers  V01
end  
user  
transportation  
rates  <ARG1
for  
2003  
lower  
for  
most  
customers  
than

in  
effect  V01
today  
.  
*  

*  
Provides  V01
for  
vintaged  
Redwood  
path  
rates  <ARG2
for  
core  
customers  
.  
*  

*  
Offers  V01
a  
7.5  
cent  
/  
dth  
rate  <ARG1
to  
large  
customers  <ARG3
while  
minimizing  V01
rate  >ARG1
changes  V01
to  
other  
customers  <ARGM-GOL
,  
minimizing  V01
the  
incentive  <ARG1
for  
these  
customers  >>ARG0
to  
seek  V01
to  
bypass  V01
local  >ARGM-ADJ
transmission  >ARG3
charges  V01
and  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
CPUC  
-  
approved  >ARGM-ADJ
charges  V01
.  
*  

*  
Adopts  V01
guidelines  >>>ARG0
to  
improve  V01
reliability  <ARG1
and  
help  V01
moderate  V01
prices  V01
in  
gas  
commodity  
markets  <ARG1
,  
and  
identifies  V01
the  
capital  
projects  >ARG0
needed  V01
to  
meet  V01
these  
guidelines  <ARG1
over  
the  
course  <<ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
GA  
II  
period  
(  
2003  
-  
2007  
)  
.  
*  

*  
Provides  V01
a  
high  
degree  <ARG1
of  
rate  
stability  
,  
with  
a  
3.5  
%  
escalator  >ARG0
to  
capture  V01
both  
inflation  V01
and  
the  
cost  
of  
needed  
capital  
projects  
.  

The  
guaranteed  
rates  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
adjustable  <ARG2
only  
for  
significant  >ARGM-ADJ
changes  V01
in  
the  
cost  <ARG1
of  
capital  
or  
increased  
costs  
due  
to  
governmental  >ARG0
requirements  V01
or  
catastrophic  
events  
.  
*  

*  
Preserves  V01
a  
rate  
differential  <ARG1
between  
the  
Redwood  
and  
Baja  
paths  
,  
although  
somewhat  
less  <ARGM-ADV
than  
the  
current  
differential  
.  
*  

*  
Proposes  V01
a  
two

open  
season  >>ARG1
for  
firm  >ARG0
transportation  >ARG1
services  V01

,  
with  
end  
users  >ARG0
receiving  V01
a  
first  
option  <ARG1
on  
available  
capacity  
.  
*  

*  
Maintains  V01
the  
core  >ARG0
aggregation  V01
program  <C-ARG0
with  
some  >ARGM-EXT
adjustments  V01
.  

PG&E  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
anticipates  V01
that  
the  
Core  >ARGM-ADJ
Procurement  V01
Incentive  
Mechanism  >>>ARG1
(  
CPIM  
)  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
similar  V01
to  
today  
's  
mechanism  <ARG2
,  
but  
will  >ARGM-MOD
reflect  V01
the  
somewhat  
larger  >ARGM-ADJ
capacity  >ARG1
holdings  V01
needed  V01
to  
meet  V01

-  

instead  
of  
suggesting  V01
a  
specific  >ARGM-ADJ
rate  >ARG1
increase  V01
-  
10  
or  
15  
%  <ARG2
,  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
acknowledge  V01
that  
a  
"  
modest  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
increase  V01
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
necessary  V02
and  
may  >>ARGM-MOD
in  
fact  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V01
desirable  V02
-  
but  
that  
the  
specific  
amount  >>>ARG1
of  
increase  V01
should  >>>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
reasoned  <ARG2
and  
subject  
to  
well  
thought  >ARGM-ADJ
out  
evidence  
and  
hearings  V02
,  
not  
just  >ARGM-ADV
determined  V01
by  
whim  <ARG2
.  

In  
general  
,  
we  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
overly  
prescriptive  <ARG2
at  
this  
point  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >ARG0
know  V01
you  >ARG0
agree  V01
with  
that  <ARG1
.  

Otherwise  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
you  >>ARG0
have  V01
captured  V01
the  
points  <ARG1
excellently  <ARGM-MNR
.  

We  >ARG1
're  V01
in  
the  
process  V02
of  
developing  V02
a  
strategy  >ARG0
to  
take  V01
us  <ARG1
through  
the  
next  
few  
months  <ARGM-DIR
.  

But  >>>ARGM-DIS
while  
the  
(  
otherwise  
perishable  >ARGM-ADJ
)  
thoughts  V01
are  V01
still  >ARGM-TMP
fresh  V04
in  
my  
mind  <ARGM-LOC
from  
the  
hearings  V02
on  
Monday  <ARGM-TMP
and  
Tuesday  
,  
I  >>ARG0
wanted  V01
to  
throw  V04
out  
some  
observations  V01
for  
discussion  V01
in  
the  
days  <<<ARGM-TMP
/  
weeks  
ahead  
.  

OBSERVATION  V02
--  
The  
pressure  >>>ARG1
to  
finger  V03
somebody  <ARG1
for  
"  
price  >ARG1
gouging  V01
"  
is  V03
increasing  V01
.  

The  
administration  V01
is  V01
hell  >ARGM-EXT
bent  V06
on  
finding  V01
a  
"  
fall  
guy  <ARG1
.  
"  

The  
price  >ARG1
spikes  V04
pose  V02
real  >ARGM-ADJ
political  >ARGM-ADJ
risks  V01
for  
Davis  <<ARG2
and  
he  >>ARG0
and  
his  
folks  
need  V01
and  
want  V01
an  
easy  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
out  <ARG1
.  

His  >ARG0
press  >ARGM-GOL
release  V01
following  
the  
hearing  V02
renewed  V01
the  
call  V03
for  
"  
refunds  V01
.  
"  

On  
my  
panel  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Loretta  >ARG0
Lynch  
asked  V02
Reliant  >ARG0
and  
Duke  
to  
supply  V01
her  <ARG2
with  
the  
details  <ARG1
of  
the  
contracts  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
cut  V03
to  
sell  V01
their  
power  <ARG1
forward  <ARGM-DIR
to  
marketers  <ARG2
.  

And  >>>ARGM-DIS
Carl  >ARG0
Wood  
's  
remarks  V01
were  V01
extreme  V01
.  

At  
the  
Barton  >>ARGM-LOC
hearing  V02
,  
a  
liberal  
democrat  >>ARG0
(  
Filner  
)  
and  
a  
conservative  
Republican  
(  
Hunter

locked  V01
arms  <ARG1

calling  V03

the  
"

band  
wagon  <ARG1

The  
utilities  >ARG0
repeatedly  >ARGM-ADV
called  V03
on  
FERC  <ARG2
to  
do  V02
a  
"  
real  >ARGM-ADJ

On  
the  
positive  
side  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
FERC  
commissioners  >ARG0
lauded  V01
Wolak  <ARG1
,  
his  >ARG0
analysis  V01
,  
and  
his  >ARG0
remarks  V01
on  
the  
panel  <ARG1
.  

Wolak  >ARG0
said  V01
somewhat  
emphatically  <ARGM-MNR
that  
the  
nature  >ARG0
of  
California  
's  
market  
structure  
makes  V02
it  <ARG1
impossible  V01
to  
single  V01
out  
a  
single  
participant  <ARG1
as  
the  
culprit  <ARG3
.  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
stated  V01
that  
just  
everyone  >>>ARG0
's  V03
just  >ARGM-ADV
acting  V01
in  
their  >ARG1
own  >ARGM-REC

IMPLICATION  V01
--  
It  >>ARG1
seems  V01
prudent  V01
for  
Enron  >ARG0
to  
understand  V01
better  <ARGM-EXT
its  >ARG0
risks  V01
of  
getting  V03
fingered  V03
.  

In  
the  
best  
case  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
clamoring  V01
for  
a  
"  
refund  V01
"  
subsides  V01
.  

In  
which  
case  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
only  
cost  >ARG1
to  
Enron  
is  V01
the  
internal  
cost  >ARG1
incurred  V01
to  
understand  V01
better  <ARGM-EXT
the  
risks  V01
of  
getting  V03
fingered  V03
.  

In  
the  
medium  
case  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
investigations  V01
find  V01
that  
Enron  >ARG0
(  
like  
others  >ARGM-ADV
)  
"  
played  V01
by  
the  
rules  V01
,  
"  
but  
the  
rules  V01
stunk  V01
,  
and  
Enron  >ARG0
profited  V01
at  
the  
expense  <ARGM-MNR
of  
California  
consumers  
.  

You  >>ARG1
're  V01
right  V06

it  <ARG1

Thanks  V01
very  
much  <ARGM-EXT
for  
the

Harry  
also

This

Just  
like  
what  >>>ARGM-ADV
happened  V01
in  
Enron  
's  
initial  
VPP  
program  <ARG2
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
find  V01
more  >ARGM-EXT
interest  V01
in  
oil  >ARG3

projects  <<ARG2
rather  
than  
natural

They  >>ARG0
are  V03
currently  >ARGM-TMP
working  V01
on  
a  
bid  V01
(  
due  <ARGM-ADJ

for  
the

Callon  
in  
Mississippi  
Canyon

538  
and  
#  
582  
.  

The  
initial  >ARGM-TMP
reservoir  >ARG1
reports  V01
estimate  V01
reserves  <ARG1
of  
80  
-  
120  
million  
barrels  
of  
sour  
crude  
and  
they  >ARG0
estimate  V01
initial  >ARGM-TMP
production  V01
to  
be  V01
40,000  
bpd  >ARG1
starting  V01
in  
1Q  <ARGM-TMP
2003  
.  

Quality  >>>ARG1
is  V03
estimated  V01
to  
be  V01
a  
Mars  
type  
crude  <ARG2
with  
25  
-  
27  
API  
Gravity  
and  
1.5

2.0

are  V01
to  
build  V01
a  
private  
pipeline  <ARG1
to  
Equilon  
's  
West  
Delta  
#  
143  
platform

then  >ARGM-TMP
bring  V01
the

out  
where  >ARG1
WD  >ARG0
#  
143  
pumps  V01
to  <C-ARG1
onshore  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Tom  
's  
group  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
know  V01
if  
we  >>>ARG0
have  VLV
any  
interesting  V01
in  
buying  V01
the  
crude  <ARG1
on  
either  
a  
fixed  
or  
floating  
basis  <ARGM-MNR
.  

The  
floating  V02
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
tied  V01
to  
a  
Platt  
's  
index  <ARG2
or  
the  
NYMEX  
.  

It  >>ARG1
is  V01
far  
too  >ARGM-CXN
early  V01
to  
expect  V01
Murphy  >ARG0
to  
enter  V01
into  
a  
physical  
or  
financial  
contract  <ARG1
,  
but  
Tom  >>>ARG0
hopes  V01
to  
get  VLV
us  >ARGM-GOL
first  >ARGM-TMP
and  
/  
or  
last  
look  V01
from  
Murphy  <ARGM-ADV
when  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
time  >>ARG1
is  V01
right  V03
.  

Another  
alternative  >ARG1
is  V01
to  
give  V01
Murphy  <ARG2
barrels  <ARG1
at  
their  
95,000  
bpd  
Meraux  
,  
Louisiana  
refinery  <ARGM-LOC
in  
exchange  V01
for  
the  
new  
production  
barrels  <ARG3
.  

Could  >ARGM-MOD
someone  >ARG0
in  
your  
group  
please  >ARGM-DIS
give  V01
me  <ARG2
a  
notional  
non  
binding  
basis  
differential  <ARG1
for  
this  
quality  
of

following  V03
up  
on  
our  >ARG0
discussion  V01
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
;  
for  
these  
types  >>>ARGM-GOL
of  
deals  V01
,  
i  >>ARG0
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
it  
s  V01
necessary  V02
to  
have  V03
all  
the  
documentation  V01
of  
our  
counterparty  >ARG0
's  
authorization  V01
to  
enter  V01
into  
the  
agreement  V01
.  

these  >ARG1
are  V01
short  
term  >ARGM-TMP
transactions  V01
and  
requiring  V01
this  
documentation  V01
will  >ARGM-MOD
cause  V01
us  >ARG0
to  
lose  V02
business  <ARG1
because  
competitive  
alternatives  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
such  >ARGM-ADJ
burdensome  >ARGM-ADJ
requirements  V01
.  

the  
primary  
reason  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
need  V01
these  
things  <ARG1
is  V01
for  
the  
scenario  >>>ARGM-ADV
where  >>>R-ARGM-ADV
a  
muni  >>>ARG0
does  VLV
a  
derivative  >ARG2
deal  V01
with  
an  
open  
-  
ended  
downside  <ARGM-MNR
,  
loses  V02
$  <ARG1
50  
million  
,  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
claims  V01
that  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
valid  
contract  <ARG2
.  

in  
our  
case  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
only  >ARGM-ADV
hedging  V01
.  

we  >>ARG0
are  V03
collecting  V01
a  
premium  <ARG1
up  
front  <ARGM-TMP
and  
their  
total  
cost  >>ARG1
is  V03
known  V01
up  
front  <ARGM-ADV
.  

therefore  >ARGM-DIS
they  >>>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
attempt  V01
to  
make  VLV
this  
claim  V01
.  

even  
if  
they  
did  V01
,  
our  >ARG0
risk  V01
is  V03
limited  V01
to  
the  
premium  <ARG2
,  
not  
some  
big  
payout  
.  

the  
risk  V01
of  
losing  V02
business  <ARG1
is  V01
far  >ARGM-EXT
greater  V05
than  
the  
risk  V01
of  
a  
counterparty  >ARG0
trying  V01
to  
get  V09
their  
premium  <ARG1
back  <C-V
.  

seems  V01
like  
a  
5  
second  >ARGM-TMP
decision  V01
to  
me  <<ARG2
.  

is  V01
it  <ARG1
possible  V01
to  
combine  V01
the  
standard  
isda  <ARG1
and  
our  
confirm  
into  
a  
single  
long  
form  <ARG3
?  

by  
going  V02
away  <ARGM-DIR
from  
the  
standard  
isda  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
eliminate  V01
these  
requirements  V01
because  
the  
payout  
liability  >ARG1
is  V01
only  <ARGM-ADV
1

(

a

her

and  
could  >ARGM-MOD

so  >ARGM-ADV
Nicki  >ARG1
(  
the  
little  
girl  
-  
10  
yrs.  
old  
)  
and  
I  
waited  V01
for  
the  
bus  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
8:15  <ARG2
and  
there  
was  V02
no  >ARGM-NEG
sign  V07
of  
her  
bus  <ARG1
.  

On  
top  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
things  
,  
I  >>ARG1
had  VLV
quiz  V01
at  
8  
am  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Which  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
then  >ARGM-TMP
realized  V01
I  >ARG0
missed  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
decided  V01
that  
Nicki  >>ARG1
would  
just  
have  V02
to  
wait  V01
on  
her  
own  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
asked  V01
her  <ARG2
if  
she  >ARG0
had  V03
any  
relatives  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
want  V01
to  
know  V01
of  
her  
whereabouts  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
called  V02
her  
grandmother  <ARG1
and  
explained  V01
things  <ARG1
to  
her  <ARG2
.  

Pretty  
strange  
...  
aye  
.  

A  
bus  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG0
runs  V01
through  
UofH  <ARGM-DIR
arrived  V01
and  
I  >ARG1
almost  >ARGM-ADV
got  V21
on  
without  
her  <ARGM-MNR
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
it  <ARG1
.  

Finally  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
told  V01
the  
little  
girl  <ARG2
that  
she  >>ARG0
would  
have  V02
to  
accompany  V01
me  <ARG1
to  
school  <ARG4
(  
8:30  
am  <ARGM-TMP
)  
.  

There  
were  V02
only  
15  
minutes  <ARG1
left  
of  
class  
.  

I  >ARG1
stayed  V01
for  
the  
remainder  <ARG3
of  
the  
lecture  
.  

After  
class  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
went  V02
back  <ARG4
to  
bus  >ARG1
stop  V01
and  
within  
minutes  >ARGM-TMP
her  
bus  >ARG1
arrived  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
told  V01
the  
bus  
driver  <ARG2
where  >ARG2
to  
drop  V03
her  <ARG1
off  <C-V
.  

I  >ARG0
notified  V01
her  
grandmother  <ARG1
with  
the  
time  <ARG2
of  
the  
departure  V01
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
relieved  V02
when  >ARGM-TMP
Nicki  >>ARG0
called  V02
to  
let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
she  >>ARG1
was  V01
home  <ARG2
safe  V01
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
send  V01
the  
memo  <ARG1
to  
the  
EGM  
business  
heads  <ARG2
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

Thanks  V01

Carol  
:  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
attempted  V01
to  
incorporate  V02
the  
changes  V01
that  >>R-ARG1
Jim  >>ARG0
has  V01
incorporated  V02
in  
our  >ARG0
long  
form  >ARGM-ADJ
power  >ARG1
agreement  V01
which  >>R-ARG1
ENA  >>ARG0
has  V01
suggested  V01
to  
date  <ARGM-TMP
into  
the  
short  
form  <<<ARG2
.  

Attached  V01
please  >ARGM-DIS
find  V01
a  
sample  
short  
form  <ARG1
(  
for  
the  
Con  
Ed  
market  
)  
for  
your  >ARG0
review  V01
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
note  V01
the  <ARG1
following  
as  
you  >ARG0
review  V01
:  

1  
.  
The  
short  
forms  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
contain  V01
the  
optionality  <ARG1
relating  
to  
our  >ARG0
performing  V01
billing  >ARG1
services  V01
--  
all  >ARG0
of  
our  
midmarket  
forms  
anticipate  V01
that  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
act  V01
as  
customer  
's  
billing  
agent  <ARG1
and  
that  
we  >>>ARG0
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
collect  V01
all  
amounts  <ARG1
due  
related  
to  
T&D  
and  
the  
like  
from  
the  
customer  <ARG2
(  
and  
reflect  V01
same  <ARG2
on  
our  
invoice  <ARGM-LOC
)  
and  
pass  V09
those  
amounts  <ARG1
on  <C-V
to  
the  
customer  
's  
utility  <ARG2
.  

2  
.  
I  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
include  V01
a  
"  
Setoff  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
provision  V01
in  
this  
draft  <<ARG2
,  
mainly  
because  
the  
vast  
majority  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
time  
,  
we  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
,  
nor  
will  
an  
affiliate  
,  
have  VLV
another  
agreement  V01
in  
place  <ARGM-LOC
with  
these  
customers  <ARG2
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
feel  V01
strongly  <ARG1
about  
our  >ARG0
including  V01
a  
setoff  >ARGM-ADJ
provision  V01
,  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
so  <ARG1
.  

3  
.  
The  
change  V01
in  
law  >ARG1
provision  V01
reads  V01
a  
bit  
differently  <ARGM-MNR
from  
the  
long  
form  
--  
the  
thinking  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
is  V01
that  
the  
long  
form  
language  >>ARG1
is  V01
very  
lengthy  <ARG2
and  
rather  >ARGM-EXT
harsh  V02
(  
and  
we  >>ARG0
've  V01
had  V03
great  
difficulty  <ARG1
selling  V01
it  <ARG1
in  
the  
past  <<ARGM-TMP
)  
.  

Taking  VLV
into  
consideration  V02
this  
class  <ARG1
of  
customer  
,  
we  >>ARG0
decided  V01
to  
include  V01
certain  
items  <ARG1
,  
including  
our  
inability  
to  
cover  V01
our  
costs  <ARG1
due  
to  
a  
change  V01
in  
law  <ARG1
,  
rules  V01
or  
practices  
as  
a  
"  
force  
majeure  
event  <<<ARGM-PRD
"  
in  
an  
effort  V01
to  
soften  V01
the  
approach  V02
(  
see  V01
the  
GTCs  <ARG1
)  
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
we  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
address  V02
calculation  V01
of  
a  
termination  >ARG3
payment  V01
in  
the  
event  <ARGM-ADV
of  
a  
change  V01
in  
law  <ARG1
as  
the  
long  
form  
does  V01
--  
again  
,  
more  
in  
the  
interest  V01
of  
"  
saving  V03
space  <ARG1
"  
than  
anything  
else  
...  

Let  V01
us  >ARG0
know  V01
your  >ARG0
thoughts  V01
on  
this  
document  <ARG2
and  
if  
you  >ARG1
are  V01
comfortable  <ARG2
with  
our  >ARG0
using  V01
this  <ARG1
until  
such  
time  <ARGM-TMP
as  
the  
hybrid  
form  >>ARG1
is  V03
launched  V01
.  

If  
you  >ARG1
are  V01
comfortable  >ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
drive  V02
these

some

fine  >ARGM-ADJ
tuning  V01
of  
the

.  

I  >ARG0
spoke  V01
to  
Bob  <ARG2

this

-  
we  >>ARG1
're  V01
all  >ARGM-EXT
set  V08
on  
the

in  
the

and  
there  
is  V02
a  
minor  >>ARGM-ADJ
credit  >>ARG0
/  
billing  V01
issue  V02
in  
Paragraph  <ARGM-LOC
13  
related  <ARGM-LOC
to  
the  
timing  V02
of  
transfer  V01
of  
interest  V01
on  
collateral  <ARG2
that  >R-ARG1
Val  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
discuss  V01
with  
Ed  <ARG2
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

As  
far  >>>ARGM-ADV
as  
the

goes  V06
,  
the  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
remaining  >ARGM-ADJ
issue  V02
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
aware  V01
of  <C-ARG1
(  
aside  <<<ARGM-ADJ
from  
finalizing  V01
the  
LOC  <ARG1
)  
is  V01
whether  
we  >>>ARG0
've  V01
finished  V01
coordinating  V01
the  
Attachment  V01
containing  V01
the  
list  <ARG1

Sounds  V01

we  >ARG0

I  >ARG0
wanted  V01

look  V01
at  
what  >>ARG1

the

It  >ARG1

a

"

that  >R-ARG0

when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0

pay  V01
Transwestern  <ARG2
for  
the  
interconnect  <ARG3
due  
to  
the

you  >ARG0

be  V01
subject  <ARG2
to  
the  
CIAC  
tax  
gross  
up  
,  
but  
to  
protect  V01
ourselves  <ARG1
,  
we  >>ARG0
have  V01
added  V02
language  >ARG3
in  
Para  
3.2  
that  >R-ARG3
protects  V01
us  <ARG1
financially  <ARGM-MNR
if  
the  
IRS  >>ARG0
ever  >ARGM-TMP
comes  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR

determine  V01
that  
this

the

tax  
.  

Robert  >>>ARG0
Guthrie

department  
has  V01
worked  V01
with  
us  <ARG3
to  
develop  V02
this

We  >>ARG0
hope  V01
to

this

this

If  
you  >>ARG0
have  VLV
any

please  >ARGM-DIS
let  V01

Please  >ARGM-DIS
see  V01
the  
attached  >ARGM-PRD
Interconnect  >ARG1
Agreement  V01
with  
Questar  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
wanted  V01
you  >>ARG0
all  
to  
have  VLV
a  
look  V01
at  
what  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
believe  V01
is  V01
the  
final  
draft  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
fairly  
standard  
,  
fully  
reimbursable  
interconnect  <ARG2
with  
Questar  
.  

Transwestern  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
own  V01
and  
operate  V01
the  
interconnect  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
notice  V01
that  
Questar  >>ARG0
has  V01
requested  V01
a  
"  
Payment  >ARG1

that  >R-ARG0
details  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
pay  V01
Transwestern  <ARG2
for  
the  
interconnect  <ARG3
due  
to  
the  
recent  
Enron  
events  <<<ARGM-CAU
.  

If  
anyone  >>>ARG1

any

concerns  V01
about  
the  
timing  V02
of  
these

,  
please  >>ARGM-DIS
give  VLV
me  >ARG1
a  
call  V02
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
notice  V01
this  
interconnect  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
subject  <ARG2
to  
the  
CIAC  
tax  
gross  
up  
,  
but  
to  
protect  V01
ourselves  <ARG1
,  
we  >>ARG0
have  V01
added  V02
language  >ARG3
in  
Para  
3.  
that  >R-ARG3
protects  V01
us  <ARG1
financially  <ARGM-MNR
if  
the  
IRS  >>ARG0
ever  >ARGM-TMP
comes  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
to  
determine  V01
that  
this  
interconnect  >ARG1
is  V01
subject  <ARG2
to  
the  
CIAC  
tax  
.  

Robert  >>>ARG0
Guthrie  
with  
the  
tax  
department  
has  V01
worked  V01
with  
us  <ARG3
to  
develop  V02
this  
language  <ARG1
.  

We  >>ARG0
hope  V01
to  
execute  V02
this  
Agreement  V01
this  
week  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
have  VLV
any  
comments  V01
,  
please  >ARGM-DIS
let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01

After

asking  V01

You  >ARG0

Gov.  
Gray  
Davis  
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
filed  V01
a

The

"  
Fishman  >ARG0

"  
We  >>>ARG0

What  >>ARG1

known  V01
as

authority  >>>ARG1
over  
lifting  V01

the

Can  >ARGM-MOD
we  >ARG0
discuss  V01
this  <ARG1
today  <ARGM-TMP

soon  
thereafter

My  
take  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
the  
UDCs  >>ARG1

be  V01
indifferent  V01
to  
this  <ARG2

maybe  <ARGM-ADV

our  
#  
1  
priority  >ARG1

as  
for

no  >ARGM-NEG
emails  V01

I  >ARG0
recall  V02
,  
Montavano  
,  
Shapiro  >ARG0

I  
usually  >ARGM-TMP
make  V07
up

nothing  >ARG0

As

we  >ARG0

writing  V01
that  
its

conformity  <ARG2

the  
contract

since  
it  >ARG1

in  
the  
alternative  <ARG2

and  
that  
our

hence  <ARGM-ADV
the  
only  
one  >ARG1

before  
the

(  
since  
Duke  >>>ARG0
clearly  >ARGM-ADV

this  
stage  <ARGM-TMP

having  V01
already  >ARGM-TMP

.  

Accordingly  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
issue  V02
left  V17
for  
arbitration  V01
is  V01
whether  
our

is  V01

is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG

Justin  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
have  V03
no  
knowledge  <ARG1
of  
any  
bad  
faith  
actins  >>ARG1
Enron  >ARG0
has  V03
pending  V01
in  
Texas  <<ARGM-LOC
but  
I  >ARG0

Richard  >ARG0
Sanders  
who  >R-ARG0
manages  V01
domestic  >ARGM-LOC
litgation  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>>ARG0
've  V01
read  V01
the  
materials  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
sent  V01
and  
agree  V01
we  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
address  V02
these  
allegations  V01
appropriately  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

Richard  >>ARGM-DIS
do  V01
you  >ARG0
have  V03
any  
bad  
faith  >ARGM-ADJ
litigation  V01
pending  V01
against  
any  
insurers  
in  
Texas  
or  
are  V01
you  >ARG0
aware  V01
of  
any  >>ARG1
Enron  >>ARG0
has  V01
filed  V01
??  

We  >ARG0
sued  V02
Houston  
Casualty  <ARG1
last  
year  <ARGM-TMP
but  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
recall  V02
making  VLV
any  
bad  
faith  >ARGM-MNR
claims  V01
.  

It  >ARG1
settled  V03
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
,  
a  
long  
time  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

mb  

Michelle  
,  

Did  V01
you  >ARG0
get  V01
my  
fax  <ARG1
on  
Friday  <ARGM-TMP
?  

I  >ARG0
guess  V01
the  
questions  V01
on  
which  
I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
like  V01
your  
steer  <ARG1
are  V01
:  
(  
a  
)  
Do  V01
you  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
particular  
sensitivity  <ARG1
about  
the  
reference  V01
to  
bad  
faith  >ARG2
proceedings  V02
made  VLV
by  
United  
India  
?  

(  
b  
)  
Is  V01
it  <ARG1
right  V02
that  
Enron  >ARG0
has  V03
3  
sets  <ARG1
of  
bad  
faith  >ARG2
proceedings  V02
in  
Texas  
?  

(  
c  
)  
Are  V01
you  >ARG1
happy  V01
with  
the  
draft  
letter  >ARG1
to  
Beachcrofts  
I  >ARG0
sent  V01
you  <ARG2
?  

Please  >>ARGM-DIS
give  VLV
me  >ARG1
a  
call  V02
if  
you  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
discuss  V01
.  

Justin  

Not  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
was  V01
there  <ARG2
,  
but  
I  >ARG1
was  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
there  <ARG2
the  
whole  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Michelle  
and  
Ken  
,  

were  
you  >>ARG0
able  V01
to  
discuss  V01
the  
"  
bad  
faith  >ARG2
"  
proceedings  V02
issue  V02
yesterday  <<<ARGM-TMP
?  

If  
you  >ARG0
got  V01
the  
chance  V02
today  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
grateful  V01
if  
one  >>ARG0
of  
you  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
give  VLV
me  >ARG1
a  
call  V02
to  
discuss  V01
this  
issue  V02
;  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
set  V06
out  
DPC  
's  
position  <ARG1
clearly  <ARGM-MNR
on  
this  <C-ARG1
in  
correspondence  V02
without  
too  
much  >ARG2
delay  V01
.

Dear  
Mr.  
Sanders  
-  

?  

While  
I  >ARG0
left  V02
a  
you  <ARG2
a  
phone  
message  <ARG1
with  
some  
information  
about  
our  
project  
,  
I  >ARG0
thought  V01
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
you  <ARG2
some  
additional  
details  <ARG1
by  
e-mail  <ARGM-MNR
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
...  

?  

We  >>ARG1
are  V01
still  >ARGM-TMP
very  >ARGM-EXT
interested  V01
in  
having  V04
Enron  >ARG0
support  V01
our  
eCommerce  
Dispute  >ARG1
Management  V01
Protocol  <<ARG1
.?  

We  
have  V01
had  VLV
enthusiastic  >ARGM-MNR
responses  V01
from  
companies  
such  
as  
AT&T  
,  
Duke  
Energy  
,  
Pitney  
Bowes  
and  
Daimler  
Chrysler  
,  
and  
I  >>>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
pleased  V01
to  
answer  V01
any  
questions  V01
you  <ARG0
may  <ARGM-MOD
have  VLV
about  
this  
focal  
point  <<ARG1
for  
our  >ARG0
educational  >ARG1
efforts  V01
.?  

The  
real  
purpose  >>>ARG1
of  
my  >ARG0
call  V02
,  
however  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
is  V01
related  V01
to  
the  
services  V01
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
provide  V01
to  
support  V01
the  
aspirational  >ARGM-ADJ
statements  V01
of  
the  
Protocol  <ARG0
.  

I  >ARG1
am  V01
a  
member  <ARG2
of  
the  
design  
group  >>>ARG0
that  >>>R-ARG0
has  V01
been  V03
developing  V02
the  
American  
Arbitration  
Association  >>ARG0
's  
dispute  >ARG1
management  V01
systems  <<ARG1
and  
services  V01
for  
eCommerce  
B2B  >ARG1
transactions  V01
.?  

At  
this  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG0
are  V03
putting  V03
together  <ARG2
small  
working  
groups  >>>ARG0
to  
validate  V01
some  <ARG1
of  
our  >ARG0
assumptions  V02
and  
refine  V01
our  >ARG0
initial  >ARGM-TMP
service  >ARG1
offerings  V01
.  

Initially  >ARGM-ADV
our  
design  
group  >>ARG0
,  
along  
with  
perhaps  
one  
of  
our  
technology  
consultants  
,  
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
meet  V03
with  
a  
group  <ARG1
of  
Enron  
people  
for  
half  
a  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.?  

Ideally  >ARGM-ADV
this  
group  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
consist  V01
of  
four  
to  
six  
people  <ARG2
from  
finance  V01
,  
legal  
,  
and  
operations  V01
so  
that  
we  >ARG0
get  V01
good  
cross-functional  
feedback  <ARG1
about  
our  >ARG0
services  V01
.?  

Before  
the  
meeting  V03
we  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
provide  V01
you  <ARG2
with  
a  
brief  >ARGM-ADJ
description  V01
of  
our  >ARG0
proposed  >ARGM-PRD
service  >ARG1
offerings  V01
and  
a  
list  
of  
points  
for  
discussion  V01
at  
the  
meeting  V03
.  

The  
real  
focus  >>ARG1
of  
the  
meeting  V03
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
on  
how  >ARGM-MNR
we  >>>ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
build  V01
these  
services  V01
to  
meet  V01
the  
needs  V01
of  
businesses  >ARG0
operating  V01
in  
B2B  
marketplaces  <ARGM-LOC
.?  

We  >>ARG1
are  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
concerned  V01
with  
providing  V01
services  V01
that  >>R-ARG1
are  V01
relevant  V01
to  
that  
environment  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
meet  V03
between  
November  <ARGM-TMP
14  
and  
?  
December  
1  
?  
since  
construction  V01
of  
our  >ARG0
services  V01
is  V01
already  <ARGM-TMP
underway  <ARG2
.?  

Please  >>>ARGM-DIS
let  V01
me  >>>ARG0
know  V01
what  >>ARG1
is  V01
possible  V01
,  
and  
feel  V01
free  V04
to  
give  VLV
me  >ARG1
a  
call  V02

questions  V01

you  >ARG0
heard  V01
me  <ARG2
.  

Marriage  V01
is  V01
,  
in  
and  
of  
itself  <ARGM-PRD
,  
a  
noble  
concept  <ARG2
,  
but  
it  >ARG0
too  
often  >ARGM-TMP
leads  V03
to  
kids  <ARG2
and  
kids  >ARG0
flat  
out  >ARGM-EXT
suck  V03
.  

How  >ARGM-MNR
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
say  V01
such  
an  
abomination  <ARG1
,  
ask  V01
you  <ARG0
?  

Look  V01
around  
you  <ARG1
and  
notice  V01
all  
the  
mind  >ARG1
numbing  V01
trailor  
trash  
cretins  >>ARG0
out  
there  
who  >>R-ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
procreating  V01
,  
yet  
they  
do  V01
.  

These  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
people  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
keep  V02
Jerry  <ARG1
springer  
on  
the  
air  <ARG2
.  

These  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
kids  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
destroy  V01
society  <ARG1
,  
because  
of  
the  
crapfest  >>ARG2
the  
American  
family  >>ARG1
has  V01
become  V01
under  
the  
post  
hippie  
culture  <ARGM-CAU
,  
you  >ARG0
heard  V01
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
you  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
think  V01
by  
reading  V01
this  <ARG1
I  >ARG0
blame  V01
the  
kids  <ARG1
.....  

Not  
so  
,  
Kids  >>>ARG0
are  V01
what  >ARG2
kids  >ARG1
are  V01
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
do  V02
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
literally  <ARGM-ADV
monkey  >ARG0
see  V01
and  
monkey  >ARG0
do  V02
with  
them  <<<ARGM-MNR
.  

That  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
likely  >ARGM-ADV
never  >ARGM-NEG
change  V01
.  

It  
's  V01
the  
bad  
parents  >>>ARG0
out  
there  
who  >>>R-ARG0
fuck  V02
up  
their  
lives  <ARG1
and  
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
seem  V01
to  
understand  V01
that  
once  
you  >>ARG0
decide  V01
to  
have  V05
kids  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
indeed  <ARGM-ADV
time  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
grow  V04
up  
and  
be  V01
a  
responsible  
role  
model  <ARG2
for  
those  
kids  
.  

Very  
few  
parents  >ARG0
do  V02
this  <ARG1
.  

And  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
direct  
result  <ARG2
of  
the  
Politically  
correct  
,  
permissive  
,  
time  
out  
granting  
bullshit  
liberal  
culture  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
has  V01
caused  V01
this  <ARG1
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
blame  V01
it  <ARG2
all  
on  
society  <ARG1
,  
there  
's  V02
noone  >ARG0
to  
to  
take  V01
responsibility  <ARG1
and  
all  
of  
a  
sudden  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
have  V03
generation  <ARG1
of  
fucked  
up  
kids  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
are  V03
likley  >>>ARGM-ADV
smoking  V02
,  
drinking  V01
,  
doing  V02
drugs  <ARG1
,  
fucking  V01
the  
neighbor  <ARG1
or  
some  
internet  
perv  
just  
because  
you  >>>ARG0
are  V01
too  >ARGM-CXN
lazy  V01
to  
see  V01
waht  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
're  V03
doing  V02
.  

People  >ARG0
like  
this  
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
my  
sympathy  <ARG1
,  
nor  
do  V01
they  >ARG0
deserve  V01
my  
sympathy  <ARG1
.  

Look  V01
inside  
yourselves  <ARG1
parents  <ARGM-DIS
,  
is  V01
this  <ARG1
you  <ARG2
?  

Probably  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
is  V01
.  

Fuck  V01
you  <ARG1
.  

Stop  V01
trying  V01
to  
pawn  V01
your  
brats  <ARG1
off  <ARGM-PRD
on  
others  <ARGM-GOL
to  
"  
get  VLV
a  
break  V19
"  
.  

You  >>>ARG1
made  VLV
a  
choice  V01
to  
be  V01
a  
mommy  <ARG2
,  
you  >>>ARG0
do  V01
nt  >>ARGM-NEG
get  VLV
a  
break  V19
until  
they  >ARG1
move  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR
,  
that  >ARG1
s  V01
the  
choice  V01
that  
you  <ARG0
madea  VLV
and  
that  >ARG1
's  V01
life  <ARG2
.  

Tough  
shit  
.  

Just  
because  
you  >>ARG1
're  V01
stuck  V01
,  
does  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
give  V01
you  <ARG2
the  
right  V05
to  
drag  V01
down  <ARG2
all  
the  
singles  <ARG1
around  
you  
.  

Another  
time  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
segueway  V01
into  
all  
the  
fun  
work  
related  
instances  <ARG2
where  
"  
Mommies  >>>ARG0
"  
get  V04
out  
of  
doing  VLV
work  V01
and  
hiding  V01
behind  
childcare  <ARGM-LOC
as  
the  
reason  <ARGM-PRD
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
insidious  
conspiracy  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
call  V01
"  
Mommism  <ARG2
"  
.  

It  >>ARG1
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
stamped  V05
out

It  >ARG0
looks  V02
like  
NASA  >>>ARG1
is  V01
ready  V02
to  
sour  V01
again  <ARGM-TMP
after  
it's  >ARG0
devastating  >ARGM-ADJ
loss  V02
from  
the  
Columbia  
accident  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
occurred  V01
nearly  
two  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
NASA  
engineers  >>ARG1
and  
astronauts  
are  V01
almost  >ARGM-EXT
giddy  V01
with  
"  
go  
"  
fever  <ARGM-MNR
as  
the  
tentative  
date  >>ARG1
for  
the  
first  >ARGM-TMP
launch  V01
since  
the  
Columbia  
disaster  <ARGM-TMP
approaches  V01
.  

The  
most  
important  >ARGM-ADJ
question  V01
is  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
whether  
Discovery  >>>ARG1
is  V01
technically  >ARGM-MNR
ready  V02
to  
fly  V01
with  
new  
safety  
features  <ARGM-MNR
and  
emergency  >ARGM-PRP
procedures  V01
,  
but  
whether  
the  
agency  >>ARG0
itself  
has  V01
learned  V01
from  
the  
crucial  >ARGM-ADJ
errors  V01
most  
common  <ARGM-ADJ
to  
Challenger  
and  
Columbia  
,  
errors  V01
that  >R-ARG1
grew  V01
out  
of  
a  
management  
culture  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
discouraged  V01
criticism  <ARG1
and  
sacrificed  V01
safety  <ARG1
for  
image  
-  
puffing  V01
and  
budget  >ARG1
-  
cutting  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
hope  V01
so  <ARG1
.  

Seeing  V01
another  
"  
Columbia  
"  
incident  <ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
quite  
frightening  <ARG2
(  
I  >ARG1
woke  V02
up  
to  
it  <ARG3
early  
in  
the  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
was  V01
in  
Texas  <ARG2
)  
.  

We  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
need  V01
another  
incident  <ARG1
as  
exploring  V01
the  
cosmos  <ARG1
is  V01
something  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
keeps  V02
our  >ARG0
imagination  V01
going  V09
as  
a  
species  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Maybe  >ARGM-ADV
one  
day  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
allow  V01
space  
tourism  <ARG1
,  
(  
hopefully  >ARGM-MNR
that  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
in  
the  
near  
future  <ARG2
)  
although  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend  V01
that  
NASA  >ARG0
build  V01
new  
shuttles  <ARG1
instead  
of  
trying  V01
to  
preserve  V01
the  
older  
ones  <ARG1
.  

You  >>>ARG0
do  V01
have  V02
to  
give  V01
NASA  <ARG2
credit  V01
on  
some  
things  <<ARGM-ADV
as  
they  >>ARG0
have  V01
eliminated  V01
the  
"  
fear  V01
of  
reporting  V01
failure  <ARG1
"  
culture  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
probably  >ARGM-ADV
led  V03
to  
the  
lack  V01
of  
reporting  V01
defects  <ARG1
on  
the  
Columbia  
shuttle  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Instead  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
encouraging  V01
everyone  >ARG1
to  
come  V01
forward  <ARGM-DIR
if  
they  >ARG0
see  V01
any  
potential  
problems  <ARG1
(  
as  
it  
is  V01
clear  V06
that  
overlooked  V01
problems  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
result  V01
in  
unnecessary  >ARGM-ADJ
losses  V02
)  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
supporters  >>ARG0
are  V03
pointing  V02
a  
few  
good  
things  <ARG1
out  <C-V
:  

Clearly  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
agency  >>ARG0
has  V01
worked  V01
hard  <ARGM-MNR
at  
tackling  V01
the  
technical  >ARGM-ADJ
challenges  V01
posed  V02
by  
a  
superb  
and  
surprisingly  
independent  
-  
minded  
investigative  
panel  <ARG0
.  

A  
few  
weeks  
ago  >ARGM-TMP
,  
shuttle  
workers  >ARG0
at  
the  
Kennedy  
Space  
Center  
received  V01
a  
rocket  
-  
like  >ARGM-MNR
boost  V01
in  
morale  <ARG1
with  
two  
important  >ARGM-ADJ
deliveries  V01
for  
the  
next  
shuttle  >ARG0
to  
carry  V01
.  

One  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
special  
tool  >ARG0
to  
detect  V01
damage  V01
to  
the  
thermal  
-  
protective  
tile  <ARG1
while  
in  
orbit  <<ARGM-TMP
-  
something  >>ARG1
the  
Columbia  
crew  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
welcomed  V01
.  

The  
other  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
new  
fuel  
tank  >ARG1
"  
guaranteed  V01
"  
by  
NASA  <ARG0
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
shed  V01
potentially  
fatal  
hunks  <ARG1
of  
insulation  V01
.  

NASA  >>ARG0
has  V03
some  
PR  
hurdles  >ARG1
to  
overcome  V01
in  
the  
future  <ARGM-TMP
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
let  V01
s  >ARG0
hope  V01
for  
their  
sake  <ARGM-PRP
(  
and  
the  
sake  
of  
all  
space  
lovers  
out  
there  
)  
that  
they  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
redefine  V01
their  
image  <ARG1
and  
rekindle  V01
the  
hope  V01
of  
space  >ARG1
colonization  V01
again  <<<ARGM-TMP

ideas  <ARG1
at  
the  
same  
time  <ARGM-TMP
such  
as  
"  
war  V01
is  V01
peace  V01
"  
.  

I  >ARG0
see  V01
the  
merit  <ARG1
in  
flowing  V01
with  
duality  <ARGM-MNR
.  

One  >>ARG1
of  
my  
most  >ARGM-ADV
cherished  V01
dualities  <ARG1
is  V01
the  
understanding  V01
that  
we  >ARG1
are  V01
both  <ARGM-ADV
autonomous  
individuals  <ARG2
with  
the  
power  >ARGM-MNR
to  
shape  V01
our  
personal  
destinies  <ARG1
and  
at  
the  
same  
time  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG1
are  V01
all  <ARGM-ADV
one  <ARG2
,  
that  
there  
is  V02
no  >ARGM-NEG
separation  V01
between  
you  <ARG1
and  
I  
,  
we  >ARG1
are  V01
all  <ARGM-ADV
together  <ARG2
in  
this  
thing  >ARG1
called  V01
life  <ARG2
,  
we  >ARGM-ADJ
human  >ARG1
beings  V02
,  
the  
birds  
and  
the  
tress  
,  
the  
rocks  
and  
the  
sky  
,  
all  
of  
it  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
written  V01
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT
recently  <ARGM-TMP
about  
healing  V01
the  
self  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-ADV
today  >ARGM-TMP
here  >ARG2
are  V01
a  
few  
words  <ARG1
on  
healing  V01
our  
collective  
body  <ARG1
,  
mind  
and  
soul  
.  

Think  V01
of  
all  
life  <ARG1
,  
if  
you  
will  <ARGM-ADV
,  
as  
one  
great  
choir  <ARG2
or  
one  
grand  >ARGM-ADJ
congregation  V01
.  

Our  
strength  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
our  
unity  <ARG2
and  
harmony  
.  

Any  
major  
dischord  
and  
we  >ARG0
all  
suffer  V01
.  

Any  
insult  V01
to  
the  
collective  
good  <ARG1
brings  V01
us  <ARG1
all  
down  <ARG3
.  

Living  V01
out  
of  
synch  <ARGM-MNR
with  
nature  
is  V01
the  
great  
disease  <ARG2
,  
from  
that  >ARGM-DIR
flows  V01
all  
the  
tributaries  >>>ARG1
we  >>>ARG0
have  V01
come  V04
to  
think  V01
of  <C-ARG1
as  
sickness  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG1
are  V01
only  >ARGM-ADV
as  >ARGM-CXN
strong  V02
as  
our  
weakest  <C-ARGM-CXN
,  
we  >>ARG2
are  V01
only  >ARGM-ADV
as  >ARGM-CXN
healthy  V01
as  
the  
sickest  <C-ARGM-CXN
amongst  
us  
-  
playing  V01
sports  <ARG1
and  
being  V01
in  
the  
army  <ARG2
taught  V01
me  <ARG2
that  
lesson  V01
before  
I  >>>ARG1
was  V01
finished  V01
being  V01
a  
teenager  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
the  
healthy  >ARG0
treat  V01
the  
sick  <ARG1
with  
scorn  <ARG2
and  
intolerance  
it  >ARG0
brings  V01
us  <ARG1
all  
down  <ARG3
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
those  >>ARG0
lucky  
enough  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
have  V03
Herpes  <ARG1
create  V01
a  
climate  <ARG1
of  
shame  V02
and  
indignity  
for  
those  <<ARG3
of  
us  
who  
do  V01
,  
not  
only  
are  V03
they  >ARG0
hurting  V01
us  <ARG1
,  
but  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
hurting  V01
themselves  <ARG1
.  

There  
is  V02
no  >ARGM-NEG
escape  V01
from  
the  
collective  
ocean  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
all  
swim  V01
in  <C-ARG1
.  

What  >>>ARG0
you  >ARG0
project  V02
will  >ARGM-MOD
always  >ARGM-TMP
come  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
to  
either  
reward  V01
or  
haunt  V01
you  <ARG1
.  

We  >>ARG0
are  V03
now  >ARGM-TMP
suffering  V01
from  
the  
consequences  <ARG1
of  
our  
rape  
of  
the  
environment  
,  
our  
rejection  
of  
the  
natural  
for  
the  
industrial  
,  
and  
our  >ARG0
embrace  V01
of  
violence  <ARG1
over  
peace  V01
.  

Jesus  >ARG0
said  V01
that  
what  >>ARG1
you  >ARG0
do  V02
the  
least  <ARG2
of  
the  
people  
you  >ARG0
do  V02
to  
him  <ARG2
.  

What  >>ARG1
are  V03
you  >ARG0
doing  V02
to  
the  
least  <ARG2
of  
the  
people  
?  

If  
we  >ARG1
are  V01
all  <ARGM-ADV
in  
this  
thing  >ARGM-ADV
together  <ARGM-MNR
,  
let  V01
's  >ARG0
play  V01
nice  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Remember  V01
that  
what  >>ARG0
you  >ARG0
do  V02
to  
yourself  <ARG2
affects  V01
me  <ARG1
and  
everybody  
else  
,  
remember  V01
that  
what  >>ARG0
you  >ARG0
do  V02
to  
me  <ARG2
and  
anyone  
else  
shapes  V01
your  
destiny  <ARG1
.  

No  
matter  >>>ARGM-ADV
what  
progress  V01
we  >>>ARG2
make  V01
as  
individuals  <ARGM-ADV
in  
becoming  V01
healthier  V01
,  
we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
achieve  V01
real  
health  <ARG1
until  
we  >>ARG0
collectively  >ARGM-MNR
decide  V01
to  
create  V01
a  
healthier  
reality  <ARG1
.  

Fortunately  >ARGM-DIS
circumstances  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
force  V02
our  
hand  <ARG1
soon  <ARGM-TMP
since  
our  
collective  
bad  
behaviour  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
continue  V01
indefinitely  <ARGM-TMP
.  

In  
the  
near  
future  >>ARGM-TMP
collective  >ARGM-ADJ
choices  V01
will  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
to  
be  V03
made  V01
.  

Will  >ARGM-MOD
we  >>>ARG1
choose  V01
to  
live  V01
in  
harmony  <ARG1
with  
this  
planet  <ARGM-COM
or  
crash  V01
and  
burn  V01
in  
a  
conflagration  V01
of  
arrogance  <ARG2
and  
disregard  
?  

Will  >ARGM-MOD
we  >>>ARG0
choose  V01
to  
rise  V01
about  
prejudice  <ARGM-CAU
and  
intolerance  
or  
go  V02
down  <ARGM-DIR
kicking  V01
and  
screaming  V01
with  
holding  V06
on  
to  
fear  V01
and  
anger  
?  

There  
is  V02
no  
health  <ARG1
without  
peace  V01
and  
no  >ARGM-NEG
peace  V01
without  
health  <ARGM-ADJ

Namaskar  

Hi  
All  
!  

We  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
present  V01
the  
kaoshikii  >ARG1
dance  V01
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
excellent  V03
before  
and  
after  
yoga  
postures  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
encourage  V01
you  >>ARG0
to  
do  VLV
this  
dance  V01
,  
as  
it  >>ARG0
has  VLV
tremendous  >ARGM-ADJ
positive  >ARGM-ADJ
effects  V01
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
dance  V01
for  
both  
males  <ARG0
and  
females  
.  

Dharma  

--  

Kaoshikii  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
dance  V01
which  >>R-ARG1
was  V03
invented  V01
in  
1978  <ARGM-TMP
by  
Shrii  <ARG0
Shrii  
A'nandamu'rti  
.  

It  >>>ARG0
is  V01
a  
psycho-spiritual  >ARG1
exercise  V02
and  
benefiting  V01
the  
mind  <ARG1
by  
developing  V02
stamina  <ARG1
and  
strength  
.  

Kaoshikii  >>ARG1
is  V01
especially  >ARGM-EXT
good  V04
for  
women  <ARG2
.  

It  >>>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
ward  V01
off  
and  
cure  V01
a  
number  <ARG2
of  
diseases  
,  
keeps  V02
the  
body  <ARG1
youthful  <ARG2
and  
enables  V01
an  
easy  >ARGM-ADJ
delivery  V01
in  
childbirth  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Kaoshikii  >ARG1
comes  V03
from  
the  
Sanskrit  
word  >ARG1
'  
kosa  
'  
meaning  V01
shell  <ARG2
or  
layer  
of  
mind  
.  

The  
self  >>ARG1
of  
the  
individual  
lies  V07
hidden  V01
in  
the  
innermost  
layers  <ARGM-LOC
of  
existence  
(  
kosas  
)  
.  

Thus  >ARGM-DIS
kaoshikii  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
blossoming  V01
of  
the  
microcosm  >>>ARG0
(  
unit  >ARG1
being  V02
)  
in  
its  >ARG0
attempt  V01
to  
attain  V01
a  
link  <ARG1
with  
the  
Macrocosm  
(  
Cosmic  
Consciousness  
)  
.  

This  
attempt  V01
is  V03
normally  >ARGM-TMP
referred  V01
to  <C-ARG1
as  
mysticism  <ARG2
.

"  
Dr.  >ARG0

.  

Dr.  >ARG0
Fortier  
,  
an  
orthodontist  
,  
learned  V01
there  
was  V02
at

in  
July  <<ARGM-TMP

when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
felt  V01
what  >>ARG1
he  >ARG0
thought  V01
was  V01
a  
dog  >ARG0
leaning  V01
on  
his  
tent

"  
My  >ARG0

"  
he  >ARG0
said  V01
.  

"  
A  
few  
seconds  
later  >ARGM-TMP
my

saw  V01
the  
shadow  <ARG1

a

through  
the

then  >ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG0

through

"  

The  
polar  
bear  >>ARG0
is  V01
more  >ARGM-CXN
dangerous  V01
than  
most  
other

The  
latter  >ARG0
usually  >ARGM-TMP

considers  V01
humans  <ARG1

The  
two  >>>ARG0

warn  V01
their  
friends  <ARG2

a

several

"  
Their  >ARG0

Dr.  >ARG0

"  
I  >>>ARG0
grabbed  V01
my

my

unzipped  V01

Hi  
all  
,  

There  
are  V02
already  <ARGM-TMP
several  
forums  >ARG1
around  
the  
net  
focused  V01
on  
discussing  V01
Guild  
Wars  <ARG1
,  
so  
why  >ARGM-CAU
create  V01
a  
new  
one  <ARG1
?  

I  >ARG0
say  V01
why  
not  <ARG1
?  

The  
main  
reason  >ARG1
is  V01
Google  >>ARG1
is  V01
more  >ARGM-EXT
accessible  V02
to  
the  
global  
community  <ARG0
and  
you  >>ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
rest  V01
assured  V01
that  
it  >>>ARG1
's  V03
not  
going  V04
to  
go  V01
away  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
seen  V01
great  
fan  
sites  >ARG1
suddenly  >ARGM-TMP
disappear  V01
without  
notice  V03
and  
for  
no  
reason  
.  

Usually  >ARGM-ADV
this  >ARG1
happens  V01
because  
the  
developer  >ARG0
of  
the  
site  
can  >ARGM-MOD
no  
longer  >ARGM-NEG
afford  V01
the  
cost  <ARG1
of  
bandwidth  >>ARG1
being  V03
used  V01
.  

That  >ARG1
said  V01
,  
the  
maintenance  V01
of  
this  
forum  <ARG1
is  V03
handled  V01
by  
Google  <ARG0
and  
thus  >>ARGM-ADV
will  >>ARGM-MOD
remain  V01
reliable  V02
and  
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
ultimately  >ARGM-ADV
give  V01
us  >ARG0
more  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
play  V01
:)  
.  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01
nothing  <ARG2
more  
than  
a  
devoted  
fan  
of  
the  
game  
myself  <ARGM-REC
and  
I  >ARG0
hope  V01
that  
this  
area  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
become  V01
a  
haven  <ARG2
for  
deep  >ARGM-ADJ
fan  >ARG0
discussions  V01
.

Aye

release  
date  <ARG1

2005  

Feb  >ARG1
2005  
is  V01
the  
projected  
release  
date  <ARG2

although  
Guild  
Wars  >>ARG1
is  V03
made  V01
by  
ex-members  <ARG0
of  
Blizzard  
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
Feb  >ARG1
2005  
could  >ARGM-MOD
mean  V01
August  <ARG2
2006  
...  

Anyway  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
tried  V01
to  
get  V01
a  
preorder  <ARG1
but  
no  
places  >>ARG0
were  V03
selling  V01
it  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
missed  V03
out  
on  
2/3  
weekend  
events  <ARG1
.  

Oh  >ARGM-DIS

BUT  
they  >>>ARG0
stated  V01
that

as  
long  <ARG1
as  
it  >ARG1
takes  V10
to  
work  V02
out  
all  
the  
bugs  <ARG1
so  
who  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV

how  
long  <ARG1
.  

as  
far  >>ARGM-ADV
as  
pre  
order  V02

they  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
list  <ARG1
of  
major  
retailers  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
carry  V01
it  <ARG1
there  
are  V02
also  <ARGM-ADV
a  
few  
websites  <ARG1
that  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
order  V02
it  <ARG1
off  
of  <ARG3
.  

and  
a  
good  
reason  
for  
starting  V01

This

I  >>>ARG0

you  <ARG2
in  
absolute  
confidence  <ARGM-MNR
primarily  >ARGM-ADV
to  
seek  V01

that  >>R-ARG1

in  
the

My

and  
I  
solicit  V01
your  >ARG0
assistance  V01
in  
completing  V01
a  
transaction  V01
begun  V01
by  
my  
father  >>>ARG0
,  
who  >>>R-ARG0
has  V01
long  >>ARGM-TMP
been  V03
actively  >ARGM-MNR
engaged  V01
in  
the  
extraction  V01
of  
petroleum  <ARG1
in  
the  
United

of  
America  
,  
and  
bravely  >ARGM-MNR
served  V01
his  
country  <ARG2
as  
director  <ARG1
of  
the  
United  
States  
Central  
Intelligence  
Agency  
.  

In  
the  
decade  >ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
nineteen  
-  
eighties  
,  
my  
father  >>>ARG0
,  
then  
vice  
-  
president  
of  
the  
United  
States  
of  
America  
,  
sought  V01
to  
work  V01
with  
the  
good  
offices  <ARG3
of  
the  
President  
of  
the  
Republic  
of  
Iraq  
to  
regain  V01
lost  
oil  
revenue  
sources  <ARG1
in  
the  
neighboring  V01
Islamic  
republic  <ARG1
of  
Iran  
.  

This  
unsuccessful  
venture  >>ARG2
was  V03
soon  >ARGM-TMP
followed  V01
by  
a  
falling  V03
-  
out  <C-V
with  
his  
Iraqi  
partner  >>ARG0
,  
who  >>R-ARG0
sought  V01
to  
acquire  V01
additional  
oil  
revenue  
sources  <ARG1
in  
the  
neighboring  V01
emirate  <ARG1
of  
Kuwait  
,  
a  
wholly  
-  
owned  
U.S.  
-  
British  
subsidiary  
.  

My  
father  >ARG0
re-secured  V01
the  
petroleum  
assets  <ARG1
of  
Kuwait  
in  
1991  <ARGM-TMP
at  
a  
cost  <ARGM-ADV
of  
sixty  
-  
one  
billion  
U.S.  
dollars  
(  
$  
61,000,000,000  
)  
.  

Out  
of  
that  
cost  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
thirty  
-  
six  
billion  
dollars  >>ARG1
(  
$  
36,000,000,000  
)  
were  V03
supplied  V01
by  
King  
Hussein  <ARG0
,  
Kingdom  
of  
Saudi  
Arabia  
and  
other  
Persian  
Gulf  
monarchies  
,  
and  
sixteen  
billion  
dollars  
(  
$  
16,000,000,000  
)  
by  
German  
and  
Japanese  
partners  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
my  
father  
's  
former  
Iraqi  
business  
partner  >ARG1
remained  V01
in  
control  V01
of  
the  
republic  <ARG1
of  
Iraq  
and  
its  
petroleum  
reserves  
.  

My  
family  >>ARG0
is  V03
calling  V03
for  
your  >ARG0
urgent  >ARGM-ADJ
assistance  V01
in  
funding  V01
the  
removal  V01
of  
the  
President  <ARG1
of  
the  
Republic  
of  
Iraq  
and  
acquiring  V01
the  
petroleum  
assets  <ARG1
of  
his  
country  
,  
as  
compensation  V01
for  
the  
costs  <ARG1
of  
removing  V01
him  <ARG1
from  
power  <ARG2
.  

Unfortunately  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
our  
partners  >>>ARG1
from  
1991  
are  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
willing  V02
to  
shoulder  V01
the  
burden  V01
of  
this  
new  
venture  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
in  
its  
upcoming  
phase  >ARGM-TMP
may  >ARGM-MOD
cost  V01
the  
sum  <ARG2
of  
100  
billion  
to  
200  
billion  
dollars  
(  
$  
100,000,000,000  
-  
$  
200,000,000,000  
)  
,  
both  
in  
the  
initial  >ARGM-TMP
acquisition  V01
and  
in  
long  
-  
term  >ARGM-TMP
management  V01
.  

Without  
the  
funds  >>ARGM-ADV
from  
our  
1991  
partners  
,  
we  >>>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V01
able  V01
to  
acquire  V01
the  
oil  
revenue  >ARG1
trapped  V01
within  
Iraq  <ARG2
.  

That  >ARG1
is  V01
why  >>ARGM-CAU
my  
family  >>ARG0
and  
our  
colleagues  
are  V03
urgently  >ARGM-MNR
seeking  V01
your  >ARG0
gracious  >ARGM-ADJ
assistance  V01
.  

Our  
distinguished  
colleagues  >>ARG2
in  
this  
business  >ARG1
transaction  V01
include  V01
the  
sitting  
vice-president  >ARG1

the  
United

,  
Richard

who  >R-ARG1

the  
Iraq  
venture  
and  
former  
head

,  
and  
Condoleeza  >>>ARG1
Rice  
,  
whose  >C-ARG0
professional  >ARGM-ADJ

to  
the

was  V03
demonstrated  V01
in  
the  
naming  V02
of  
a  
Chevron  
oil  
tanker  <ARG1
after  
her  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
beseech  V01
you  >ARG0
to  
transfer  V01
a  
sum  >ARG1
equaling  V01
ten  
to  
twenty  
-  
five  
percent  <ARG2
(  
10  
-  
25  
%  
)  
of  
your  
yearly  
income  
to  
our  
account  <<ARG2
to  
aid  V01
in  
this  
important  
venture  <ARG1
.  

The  
Internal  
Revenue  
Service  >ARG0
of  
the  
United

of  
America  
will  >ARGM-MOD
function  V01
as  
our  
trusted  V02
intermediary  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
propose  V01
that  
you  >>ARG0
make  VLV
this  
transfer  V01
before  
the  
fifteenth  <ARGM-TMP
(  
15th  
)  
of  
the  
month  
of  
April  
.  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
that  
a

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
answer  V01
googlenut  <ARGM-DIS
.  

Let  V01
me  >ARG0
add  V02
some  
additional  
info  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
details  <ARG1
about  
NASA  >ARG0
spending  V01
here  <<ARGM-LOC
,  
from  
their  
own  
webpage  <<ARG2
.  

Also  
,  
from  
their  
own  
webpage  
,  
reasons  >>ARGM-CAU
why  >>R-ARGM-CAU
NASA  >>ARG1
is  V01
important  V01
,  
in  
a  
5th  
grade  
format  
.  

I  >ARG0
guess  V01
if  
you  >ARG1
are  V01
someone  >>ARGM-ADV
not  
familiar  
with  
how  >ARGM-MNR
NASA  >ARG0
benefits  V01
our  
society  <ARG1
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
one  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
form  V01
the  
opinion  <ARG1
of  
yheggy  
-  
ga  
.  

Let  V01
me  >ARG0
put  V02
it  <ARG1
this  
way  <ARGM-MNR
-  
If  
you  >>>ARG0
have  V01
watched  V01
TV  <ARG1
recently  <ARGM-TMP
,  
crossed  V02
a  
modern  
bridge  <ARG1
,  
flown  V01
in  
an  
airplane  <ARGM-LOC
,  
recieved  V01
any  
form  <ARG1
of  
modern  
medicine  
,  
did  V02
any  
mathematics  <ARG1
,  
drove  V01
a  
car  <ARG1
,  
used  V01
a  
cellular  
phone  <ARG1
,  
etc.  <<<ARGM-ADV
then  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
have  V01
somehow  >ARGM-MNR
directly  >ARGM-MNR
reaped  V01
the  
rewards  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
NASA  >>ARG0
has  V01
returned  V02
to  
us  <ARG2
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
NASA  >ARG0
has  V03
a  
large  
outreach  
program  <ARG1
for  
education  V01
,  
some  
people  >ARG0
believe  V01
this  >>ARG1
is  V01
important  V01
.

i  >ARG0
believe  V01
that  
NASA  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
HUGE  >ARGM-EXT
waste  V01
of  
tax  
payers  
'  
money  <ARG1
,  
but  
there  
are  V02
so  
many  >ARGM-ADJ
huge  >ARGM-EXT
wastes  V01
of  
tax  
payer  
monies  <ARG1
,  
that  
i  >ARG0
find  V02
it  
best  V02
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
think  V01
about  
it  <ARG2
.  

i  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
think  V01
the  
National  
Endowment  >ARG1
for  
the  
Arts  
is  V01
a  
waste  V01
,  
but  
i  >ARG0
guess  V01
i  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
rather  >ARGM-ADV
see  V01
my  
money  >ARG1
go  V01
to  
the  
NEA  <ARG4
than  
NASA  <ARGM-ADV
.  

of  >ARGM-DIS
course  
,  
in  
a  
perfect  
world  >ARGM-LOC
,  
tax

'  
money  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
go  V01
toward  
some  
sort  <ARG4
of  
national  
healthcare

this  >>ARG1

far  V01
from

in  
response  V01
to  
Steve  >ARG0
's  
comment  V01
:  
do  V01
you  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
believe  V01
that  
spending  V01
trillions  <ARG3
on  
space  >ARG1
exploration  V01
over  
the  
years  <<ARGM-TMP
was  V01
the  
ONLY  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
to  
invent  V01
the  
cellfone  <ARG1
?  

and  
bridges  
???  

i  >>>ARG0
find  V02
that  >ARG1
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
hard  V02
to  
believe  V01
.  

i  >ARG0
think  V01
it  >>>ARG1
could  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V03
done  V02
in  
a  
much  
more  
cost  
efficient  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
,  
right  
here  <<ARGM-LOC
on

just  
my  
two  
cents  
.  

thanks  V01
for  
listening  V01
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
take  V01
a  
moment  <ARG1
to  
read  V01
this  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
realize  V01
that  
it  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
sound  V01
strange  V01
,  
but  
we  >>>ARG0
are  V01
desparate  <ARG2
in  
our  >ARG0
efforts  V01
and  
are  V01
willing  V02
to  
try  V01
anything  <ARG1
to  
help  V01
our  
dear  
sick  
friend  <ARG2
.  

This  >>ARG0
costs  V01
absolutely  
nothing  <ARG2
,  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
take  V10
about  
one  
minute  <ARG1
of  
your  
time  
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
hoax  <ARG2
,  
as  
so  
many  >>ARG1
of  
these  
emails  V01
actully  >ARGM-ADV
are  V01
.  

In  
quick  
summary  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
Beyond  
Control  >>ARG0
,  
a  
local  
band  
in  
our

,  
is  V03
sponoring  V01
a  
benefit  <ARG1
for  
a

out  
.  

That  
band  >>ARG1
is  V01
involved  V01
in  
a

promises  V01
a  
$  
5000  
first  
prize  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
they  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD

to  
win  V01
in

to  
donate  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
the

Below  >ARG2

to  
put  V03
them  <ARG1

first  
place  <ARG2
.  

They  >>ARG0
are  V01
currently  <ARGM-TMP
in  
third  
place  <ARG2
,  
and  
need  V01
your  >ARG0
help  V01
so  
that  
the  
prize  
money  >>ARG1

used  V01
for  
a  
humanatarian  
cause  <ARG2

a

her  
time  >>>ARG1
on  
the  
Federal  >ARG0
Grant  V01

has  V01
expired  V01
.  

She  >>ARG0
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
the

continue  V01
without  
the

and  
without

her

I  >ARG0
hope  V01

so  
that  
the

We  >ARG0

China  >ARG0
's  
insatiable  >ARGM-ADJ
demand  V01
for  
energy  <ARG1
is  V03
prompting  V01
fears  V01
of  
financial  >ARG0
and  
diplomatic  
collisions  V01
around  
the  
globe  <<<ARGM-LOC
as  
it  >ARG0
seeks  V01
reliable  >ARGM-ADJ
supplies  V01
of  
oil  <ARG1
from  
as  
far  
away  <ARGM-DIR
as  
Brazil  
and  
Sudan  
.  

An  
intrusion  V01
into  
Japanese  
territorial  
waters  <ARG2
by  
a  
Chinese  
nuclear  
submarine  <ARG0
last  
week  <ARGM-TMP
and  
a  
trade  >ARG2
deal  V01
with  
Brazil  <ARG1
are  V01
the  
latest  
apparently  
unconnected  
consequences  <ARG2
of  
China  
's  
soaring  V01
economic  
growth  <ARG1
.  

Increased  
car  
usage  >>ARG0
in  
China  
is  V03
creating  V01
a  
high  >ARGM-EXT
demand  V01
for  
petrol  <ARG1

The  
connection  V01
,  
however  >ARGM-ADV
,  
lies  V07
in  
an  
order  V01
issued  V01
last  
year  <ARGM-TMP
by  
President  <ARG0
Hu  
Jintao  
to  
seek  V01
secure  >ARGM-ADJ
oil  >ARG1
supplies  V01
abroad  <<ARGM-LOC
-  
preferably  
ones  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
stopped  V01
by  
America  <ARG0
in  
case  V04
of  <ARG1
conflict  V01
over  
Taiwan  <ARG2
.  

The  
submarine  
incident  >>ARG1
was  V03
put  V03
down  <ARGM-DIR
to  
a  
"  
technical  >ARGM-ADJ
error  V01
"  
by  
the  
Chinese  
government  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
apologised  V01
to  
Japan  <ARG2
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
even  
before  
the  
incident  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
People  
's  
Daily  >>ARG0
,  
the  
government  
mouthpiece  
,  
had  V01
commented  V01
that  
competition  V01
over  
the  
East  
China  
Sea  <ARG2
between  
the  
two  
countries  <ARG0
was  V01
"  
only  <ARGM-ADV
a  
prelude  <ARG2
of  
the  
game  
between  
China  
and  
Japan  
in  
the  
arena  
of  
international  
energy  
"  
.  

The  
Brazil  >ARG0
trade  >ARG2
deal  V01
included  V01
funding  V01
for  
a  
joint  
oil  >ARG3
-  
drilling  V01
and  
pipeline  
programme  <<ARG1
at  
a  
cost  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
experts  >ARG0
said  V01
would  >ARGM-MOD
add  V04
up  
to  
three  
times  
the  
cost  <ARG2
of  
simply  >ARGM-ADV
buying  V01
oil  <ARG1
on  
the  
market  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
West  >>>ARG0
,  
however  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
has  V01
paid  VLV
little  >ARGM-ADJ
attention  V02
to  
these  
developments  V01
.  

For  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
United  
States  >>ARG1
and  
Europe  
are  V01
far  
more  >ARGM-EXT
concerned  V01
with  
the  
even  
more  
sensitive  >ARGM-ADJ
issues  V02
of  
China  >ARG0
's  
relations  V03
with  
"  
pariah  
states  <ARG2
"  
.  

In  
September  >ARGM-TMP
,  
China  >>ARG0
threatened  V01
to  
veto  V01
any  
move  V02
to  
impose  V01
sanctions  <ARG1
on  
Sudan  <ARG2
over  
the  
atrocities  <ARGM-CAU
in  
Darfur  
.  

It  >>ARG0
has  V01
invested  V01
$  <ARG1
3  
billion  
in  
the  
African  
country  
's  
oil  
industry  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
supplies  V01
it  <ARG2
with  
seven  
per  
cent  <ARG1
of  
its  >ARG0
needs  V01
.  

Then  >ARGM-ADV
,  
this  
month  >ARGM-TMP
,  
it  >ARG0
said  V01
that  
it  >ARG0
opposed  V01
moves  V02
to  
refer  V02
Iran  >ARG0
's  
nuclear  >ARG1
stand  V16
-  
off  <C-V
with  
the  
International  
Atomic  
Energy  
Agency  <ARG2
to  
the  
United  
Nations  
Security  
Council  <<ARG2
.  

A  
week  
before  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
China  
's  
second  
biggest  
state  
oil  
firm  >>ARG0
had  V01
signed  V02
a  
$  >ARG3
70  
billion  
deal  V01
for  
oilfield  >ARG1
and  
natural  
gas  
development  V02
with  
Iran  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
already  >ARGM-TMP
supplies  V01
13  
per  
cent  <ARG1
of  
China  >ARG0
's  
needs  V01
.  

China  >>ARG1
has  V03
its  
own  
reserves  <ARG1
of  
oil  
and  
natural  
gas  
and  
once  >ARGM-TMP
was  V01
a  
net  
oil  
exporter  <ARG2
.  

But  
as  
its  
economy  >>ARG1
has  V01
expanded  V01
by  
an  
average  <ARG2
of  
nine  
per  
cent  
per  
year  
for  
the  
last  
two  
decades  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  
has  V01
its  >ARG0
demand  V01
for  
energy  <ARG1
.  

This  
year  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG0
overtook  V01
Japan  <ARG1
as  
the  
world  
's  
second  
largest  
consumer  <ARGM-PRD
of  
energy  
,  
behind  
the  
US  
.  

Its  >ARG0
projected  >ARGM-PRD
demand  V01
,  
boosted  V01
by  
a  
huge  >ARG2
rise  V01
in  
car  >ARG1
ownership  V01
as  
well  
as  
the  
need  V01
to  
find  V01
alternatives  <ARG1
to  
polluting  
coal  
for  
electricity  >ARG1
generation  V01
,  
has  V01
contributed  V01
to  
the  
surge  V01
in  
the  
price  V01
of  
oil  <ARG1
this  
year  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Shortages  >>ARG0
are  V03
already  >ARGM-TMP
leading  V03
to  
power  >ARG1
cuts  V02
in  
the  
big  
cities  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

Since  
President  >ARG0
Hu  
ordered  V01
state  
-  
owned  
oil  
firms  >>ARG0
to  
"  
go  V01
abroad  <ARG4
"  
to  
ensure  V01
supply  V01
,  
they  >>>ARG0
have  V01
begun  V02
drilling  V01
for  
gas  <ARG3
in  
the  
East  
China  
Sea  <ARGM-LOC
,  
just  <ARGM-LOC
west  
of  
the  
line  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
Japan  >ARG0
regards  V01
as  
its  
border  <ARG2
.  

Japan  >ARG0
protested  V02
,  
to  
no  
avail  <ARGM-ADV
,  
that  
the  
project  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
joint  
one  <ARG2
.  

The  
two  >>>ARG0
are  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
set  V08
to  
clash  V01
over  
Russia  
's  
oil  
wealth  <ARG2
.  

China  >ARG1
is  V01
furious  <ARG2
that  
Japan  >>ARG0
has  V01
outbid  V01
it  <ARG1
in  
their  >ARG0
battle  V01
to  
determine  V01
the  
route  <ARG1
of  
the  
pipeline  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
Russia  >>ARG0
intends  V01
to  
build  V01
to  
the  
Far  
East  
.  

Japan  
favoured  
a  
route  
to  
the  
sea  
,  
enabling  V01
oil  >>ARG1
to  
be  V03
shipped  V01
to  
both  
Japan  <ARG2
and  
China  
.  

China  >ARG0
wanted  V01
an  
overland  
route  >ARG0
through  
its  
own  
territory  
,  
which  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
it  <ARG2
ultimate  >ARGM-ADJ
control  V01
if  
hostilities  >ARG1
broke  V06
out  
.  

Increasingly  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
analysts  >>ARG0
are  V03
saying  V01
that  
China  >ARG0
's  
efforts  V01
have  V01
gone  V01
beyond  
what  >ARG1
is  V01
safe  <ARG2
or  
even  
in  
its  >ARG1
own  >ARGM-REC
interests  V01
.

said  V01
the  
reserves  >>ARG1
in  
the  
East

Sea  
were  V01
hardly  >ARGM-ADV
worth  V02
the  
trouble  <ARG2

Nobody  >ARG0

China  >ARG0

wider  >ARGM-EXT

Visualizations  V01
as  
a  
helpful  
beginning  
technique  <ARGM-ADJ

-----------------------------------------------  

If  
you  >ARG0
consider  V01
that  
you  >>>ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
need  V01
the  
assistance  V01
of  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
visualizations  V01
to  
help  V01
the  
mind  >ARG0
feel  V01
the  
spirit  <ARG1
of  
transcendence  
,  
try  V01
the  
following  <ARG1
before  
moving  V01
onto  
the  
more  
formal  
method  <ARG2
below  
.  

Visualisations  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
as  
useful  
tools  <ARG2
,  
but  
meditation  V01
is  V01
more  <ARG2
than  
that  
.  

Meditation  V01
has  V02
to  
do  V04
with  
what  >>ARG1
is  V03
called  V01
ideation  V01
.  

It  
is  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
good  V02
to  
stick  V01
to  
a  
formal  
intense  >ARGM-ADJ
meditation  V01
practice  <<ARG2
like  
the  
one  >ARG1
for  
beginners  
described  V01
in  
the  
MP3  
file  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
follows  V01
after  
the  
visualisations  <ARG2
.  

Find  V01
a  
comfortable  
place  <ARG1
on  
the  
floor  
and  
sit  V01
with  
your  
legs  >ARG1
crossed  V01
.  

Place  V01
your  
hands  <ARG1
one  <ARG2
on  
top  
of  
the  
other  
in  
your  
lap  <ARGM-LOC
,  
keep  V02
your  
back  >ARG1
straight  V04
,  
eyes  >ARG1
closed  V01
and  
tongue  
on  
the  
roof  
of  
your  
mouth  
.  

Your  >ARG0
breathing  V01
should  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
calm  <ARG2
and  
relaxed  
,  
through  
the  
nose  
.  

Spend  V02
a  
minute  <ARG1
or  
so  
concentrating  V01
on  
your  >ARG0
breath  V01
,  
feeling  V01
the  
air  >ARG1
flowing  V01
through  
your  
nostrils  <ARGM-DIR
.  

1  
.  
Warm  
Sun  >ARG1
Visualization  V01

Continue  V01
to  
breathe  V01
slowly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
deeply  
.  

With  
each  
breath  V01
,  
feel  V01
the  
muscles  >>>ARG1
in  
your  
body  
becoming  V01
lighter  V06
and  
lighter  V06
,  
and  
also  >>ARGM-ADV
your  
external  
motor  
and  
sensory  
organs  >>ARG0
are  V03
feeling  V01
like  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
withdrawing  V01
from  
the  
world  <ARG2
into  
a  
special  
inner  
quietness  <ARGM-DIR
.  

Imagine  V01
the  
tension  V01
melting  V01
away  <ARGM-PRD
as  
you  >>ARG0
continue  V01
breathing  V01
rhythmically  <ARGM-MNR
and  
naturally  
.  

Picture  V01
yourself  >>ARG0
sitting  V01
on  
a  
warm  
,  
tropical  
beach  <ARG2
basking  V01
in  
the  
glow  <ARG1
of  
the  
sun  
...  
.  

Visualize  V01
the  
vivid  
,  
beautiful  
colours  <ARG1
of  
the  
earth  
(  
its  
flowers  
and  
plants  
)  
,  
the  
sea  
next  
to  
you  
,  
and  
the  
sky  
above  
you  
.  

Feel  V01
yourself  <ARG1
floating  V01
above  
the  
earth  <ARGM-LOC
and  
sea  
.  

As  
you  >ARG1
sit  V01
above  
the  
world  <ARG2
,  
the  
warmth  >>ARG0
of  
the  
golden  
sun  
penetrates  V01
your  
body  <ARG1
and  
makes  V02
you  >>>ARG1
feel  V01
warmer  V07
and  
warmer  V07
.  

It  >ARG1
surrounds  V01
you  <ARG2
.  

The  
golden  
rays  >>ARG1
feel  V05
soft  V02
and  
soothing  
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
are  V01
far  
above  
the  
earth  <ARG2
-  
into  
space  
.  

Everything  >ARG1
around  
you  
is  V01
so  
vast  <ARG2
.  

Yet  
,  
there  
is  V02
warmth  <ARG1
and  
a  
familiarity  
with  
the  
vastness  
.  

You  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
merge  V01
your  
mind  <ARG1
with  
the  
greater  
universal  
Mind  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
surrounds  V01
you  <ARG2
.  

Continue  V01
to  
ideate  <ARG1
on  
this  
intense  
desire  
for  
your  
mind  >ARG1
to  
merge  V01
with  
the  
that  
universal  
Consciousness  <ARG2
.  

And  
while  
doing  V02
so  <ARG1
continue  V01
using  V01
the  
Baba  
Nam  
Kevalam  
mantra  <ARG1
(  
breathe  V01
in  <ARG2
with  
Baba  <ARGM-MNR
Nam  
,  
breathe  V01
out  <ARG2
with  
Kevalam  <ARGM-MNR
)  
.  

Try  V01
this  <ARG1
for  
5  
to  
10  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
come  V01
back  <ARG4
to  
earth  
again  <ARGM-ADV
-  
slowly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Imagine  V01
yourself  <ARG1
sitting  V01
on  
the  
beach  <ARG2
serenely  <ARGM-MNR
and  
restfully  
.  

Your  
muscles  >>ARG1
are  V01
loose  V04
and  
limp  
.  

Feel  V01
your  
body  >>>ARG0
sinking  V01
slightly  <ARG2
into  
the  
sand  <ARGM-DIR
making  VLV
that  
earthly  >ARG2
connection  V01
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
sun  
's  
rays  >>ARG1
and  
warmth  
are  V01
still  <ARGM-TMP
with  
you  <ARG2
,  
surrounding  V01
you  <ARG2
.  

You  >ARG1
are  V01
in  
a  
state  <ARG2
of  
peace  V01
and  
relaxation  V01
.  

With  
each  
breath  V01
,  
watch  V01
your  
body  <ARG1
and  
ensure  V01
that  
it  >ARG1
remains  V01
relaxed  <ARG3
-  
at  
peace  V01
.  

Continue  V01
to  
feel  V01
the  
warmth  >ARG0
of  
the  
sunlight  
all  
over  
your  
body  <ARGM-LOC
,  
warming  V01
you  <ARG1
deeply  <ARGM-MNR
and  
gently  
.  

You  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
bring  V01
something  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
with  
you  <ARGM-COM
from  
your  >ARG0
deep  
space  >ARG1
experience  V01
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
you  >ARG0
sensed  V01
your  
mind  >ARG1
merging  V01
with  
the  
universal  
Mind  <ARG2
.  

This  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
the  
warmth  <ARG2
of  
the  
sun  
-  
a  
close  
reminder  
and  
link  
between  
earth  
and  
the  
infinite  
space  
.  

Visualize  V01
the  
inside  <ARG1
of  
your  
body  
bathed  V01
in  
the  
golden  
light  <ARG2
,  
absorbing  V01
every  
ray  <ARG1
and  
glowing  V01
as  
radiantly  <ARGM-MNR
as  
the  
sun  
.  

A  
warm  
,  
gentle  
breeze  >>ARG0
swirls  V01
around  
your  
body  <ARGM-LOC
and  
relaxes  V01
you  <ARG1
even  
more  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Let  V01
your  
mind  >ARG1
and  
body  
be  V01
totally  
at  
peace  V01
.  

Now  >>>ARGM-TMP
feel  V01
yourself  >ARG1
returning  V01
to  
where  >ARG2
you  >ARG1
sit  V01
...  
move  V01
your  
hands  <ARG1
and  
feet  
a  
little  <ARGM-EXT
,  
stretch  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

Open  V01
your  
eyes  <ARG1
.

.  
Mountain  >ARG1
Visualization  V01

Another  
thing  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
try  V01
.  

Imagine  V01
you  >>ARG1
're  V03
sitting  V01
on  
top  <ARG2
of  
a  
mountain  
,  
and  
that  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
the  
most  
peaceful  
place  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
think  V01
of  <C-ARG1
.  

Feel  V02
that  
you  >>ARG1
're  V03
sitting  V01
there  <ARG2
in  
complete  >ARGM-EXT
peace  V01
,  
right  
on  
top  <<ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
world  
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
imagine  V01
that  
infinite  
happiness  >>ARG1
is  V03
surrounding  V01
you  <ARG2
in  
every  
direction  <ARGM-DIR
.  

Feel  V02
you  >>ARG2
're  V03
completely  >ARGM-EXT
surrounded  V01
by  
that  
infinite  >ARGM-EXT
peace  V01
and  
happiness  
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
start  V01
to  
repeat  V01
within  
your  
mind  <ARGM-MNR
the  
mantra  <ARG1
:  
BABA  
NAM  
KEVALAM  
.  

Its  >ARG1
meaning  V01
is  V01
"  
Infinite  
happiness  >ARG1
is  V01
everywhere  <ARG2
"  
.  

Feel  V01
the  
meaning  V01
,  
do  V01
n't  >>>ARGM-NEG
just  >>>ARGM-ADV
think  V01
of  
its  >ARG1
wordy  >ARGM-ADJ
meaning  V01
or  
try  V01
to  
translate  V01
from  
Sanskrit  <ARG3
(  
BABA  
NAM  
KEVALAM  
)  
to  
an  
English  >ARGM-ADJ
meaning  V01
(  
Infinite  >ARGM-EXT
peace  V01
and  
happiness  
)  
.  

Think  V01
internally  <ARGM-MNR
,  
intuitively  <ARGM-MNR
,  
not  
by  
words  <ARGM-MNR
,  
of  
the  
meaning  V01
,  
as  
you  >>ARG0
're  V03
repeating  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

This  >>ARG1
is  V03
called  V01
ideation  V01
.  

It  
is  V01
important  V01
to  
take  V01
the  
idea  <ARG1
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADJ
the  
intellectual  >ARGM-MNR
analysis  V01
.  

Touching  V01
deep  
into  
the  
idea  <ARG1
is  V01
what  >ARG0
builds  V02
intuition  V01
-  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
synthetic  >ARGM-ADJ
process  V02
.  

Whereas  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
trying  V01
to  
translate  V01
and  
grapple  V01
with  <ARG1
wordy  >ARGM-ADJ
meanings  V01
is  V01
an  
intellectual  
mechanism  <ARG2
-  
an  
analytical  >ARGM-ADJ
process  V02
.  

Feel  V02
you  >>ARG2
're  V03
surrounded  V01
by  
infinite  >ARGM-EXT
peace  V01
and  
happiness  
,  
and  
feel  V02
that  
your  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-ADJ
sense  V01
of  
existence  <ARG1
is  V01
in  
direct  >ARGM-MNR
contact  V01
with  
that  
endless  >ARGM-EXT
peace  V01
and  
happiness  
all  
around  
you  <ARGM-LOC
.  

You  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
go  V02
further  <ARGM-PRD
and  
feel  V02
that  
your  
unit  
consciousness  >>ARG1
,  
a  
dot  
in  
the  
Infinite  
Consciousness  
,  
is  V03
merging  V01
with  
Infinity  <ARG2
.  

Continue  V01
for  
as  
long  <ARGM-TMP
as  
you  >ARG0
like  V01
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
open  V01
your  
eyes  <ARG1
.  

OK  >ARGM-DIS
that  >ARG1
is  V01
fairly  
basic  <ARG2
:)  
.  

The  
important  
point  >ARG1
is  V01
to  
develop  V02
some  
psycho-spiritual  >ARG3
connection  V01
between  
your  
mind  <ARG1
and  
the  
universal  
Consciousness  
or  
Supreme  
Consciousness  
.  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
worry  V02
if  
you  >>ARG0
have  V03
trouble  <ARG1
concentrating  V01
on  
the  
mantra  <ARG1
and  
ideation  V01
-  
that  >>ARG1
's  V01
normal  V02
.  

It  
takes  V10
some  
time  <ARG1
and  
practice  
to  
be  V01
able  V01
to  
focus  V01
on  
the  
one  
thought  V01
.  

The  
main  
thing  >ARG1
is  V01
to  
keep  V02
practicing  V01
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
practice  V01
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
nothing  >ARG1
happens  V01
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
a  
miracle  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
happen  V01
,  
but  
let  V01
s  >ARG0
face  V01
it  <ARG1
we  >>ARG0
're  V01
ordinary  
people  <ARG2
and  
so  >ARGM-ADV
require  V01
practical  
day  
to  
day  
techniques  <ARG1

CAROLINA  
RELIGIOUS  
COALITION  
FOR  
MARRIAGE  
EQUALITY  

From  
what  >>ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
hear  V01
from  
the  
news  
media  <ARG2
,  
one  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
easily  >ARGM-ADV
conclude  V01
that  
all  
Christians  >>ARG0
are  V01
opposed  V01
to  
gay  >ARGM-ADJ
marriage  V01
.  

But  
that  >ARG1
’s  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
case  <ARG2
.  

Last  
year  >>>ARGM-TMP
an  
organization  >>>ARG0
named  V01
the  
North  
Carolina  
Religious  
Coalition  <ARG2
for  
Marriage  
Equality  
was  V03
formed  V01
to  
get  V07
out  
the  
message  <ARG1
that  
at  
least  
some  
people  >>ARG0
of  
faith  
are  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
opposed  V01
to  
extending  V02
the  
rights  V05
and  
responsibilities  
of  
civil  >ARGM-ADJ
marriage  V01
to  
same  
-  
gender  
couples  <<<ARG2
.  

One  >>ARG1
of  
“  
NCRC4ME  >ARG0
’s  
”  
major  >ARGM-ADJ
efforts  V01
is  V01
to  
collect  V01

for  
the  
attached  >ARGM-PRD
“  
Declaration  V01
of  
Religious

”  
which  >>>R-ARG1

been  V03
and  
will  
again  
be  V03
presented  V01
to  
members  <ARG2
of  
the  
NC  
legislature  
.  

It  >>>ARG0
presents  V01
the  
case  V03
for  
marriage  
equality  <ARG1
and  
states  V01
,  
“  
We  >>ARG0
are  V03
resolved  V02
that  
the  
State  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
interfere  V01
with  
same  
-  
gender  
couples  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
choose  V01
to  
marry  V01
and  
share  V01
fully  <ARGM-MNR
and  
equally  
in  
the  
rights  V05
,  
responsibilities  
,  
and  
commitments  V01
of  
civil  >ARGM-ADJ
marriage  V01
.  
”  

A  
measure  V02
to  
amend  V01
the  
NC  
Constitution  >ARG0
to  
ban  V01
gay  >ARGM-ADJ
marriage  V01
was  V03
defeated  V01
last  
year  <ARGM-TMP
but  
already  >>>ARGM-TMP
has  V01
been  V03
reintroduced  V02
in  
the  
2005  >ARGM-TMP
legislative  >ARG0
session  V01
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
there  
is  V02
a  
real  >ARGM-ADJ
need  V01
for  
visible  >ARGM-ADJ
support  V01
for  
the

This

Throughout  
history  >>ARGM-TMP

From  
the  
shameful  
history  >>>ARGM-ADV
of  
slavery  
in  
America  
,  
the  
injustice  >>>ARG1
of  
forbidding  V01
people  >ARG1
to  
marry  V01
is  V01
evident  V01
as  
a  
denial  <ARGM-MNR
of  
a  
basic  >ARGM-ADJ
human  >ARG1
right  V05
.  

The  
American  
laws  >>>ARG0
forbidding  V01
interracial  >ARGM-ADJ

,  
now  >ARGM-TMP
struck  V08
down  
,  
were  V01
clearly  >ARGM-ADV

Denial  >>>ARG0

those  >ARG0

social  
injustice

We  >>>ARG0

protest  V01

this  
injustice  <ARG1

As  
religious  
people  >>ARGM-MNR

justice  <ARG1

legal  
equity  <ARG1
to  
same

gender  
couples  <ARG2
.  

As  
concerned  
citizens  >ARGM-PRD
we  >ARG0
affirm  V01
the  
liberty  <ARG1
of  
adults  
of  
the  
same  
gender  
to  
love  V01
and  
marry  V01
.  

We  >ARG0
insist  V01
that  
no  
one  >>>ARG0
,  
especially  
the  
state  
,  
is  V03
allowed  V01
to  
coerce  V01
people  <ARG1
into  
marriage  V01
or  
bar  V01
two  
consenting  
adults  <ARG1
,  
whether  
of  
the  
same  <ARGM-ADV
or  
differing  
genders  
,  
from  
forming  V01
the  
family  
unit  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
lets  V01
them  >>ARG1
be  V01
more  
fully  
loving  <ARG2
,  
thus  >ARGM-ADV
more  
fully  >ARGM-ADV
human  V02
.  

We  >ARG0
respect  V01
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
debate  V01
and  
discussion  V01
continue  V01
in  
many  <ARGM-LOC
of  
our  
religious  
communities  
as  
to  
the  
scriptural  >ARGM-ADJ
,  
theological  
and  
liturgical  
issues  V02
involved  V01
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
we  >>ARG1
draw  V02
on  
our  
many  
faith

to  
arrive  V01
at  
a  
common  >ARGM-ADJ
conviction  V02
.  

We  >>ARG0
are  V03
resolved  V02
that  
the  
State  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
interfere  V01
with  
same  
-  
gender  
couples  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
choose  V01
to  
marry  V01
and  
share  V01
fully  <ARGM-MNR
and  
equally  
in  
the  
rights  V05
,  
responsibilities  
,  
and

of

We  >ARG0
affirm  V01
freedom  <ARG1

in  
this  
matter  <ARGM-ADV

We  >ARG0
recognize  V02
that  
the  
state  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
require  V01
religious  
groups  >>ARG0
to  
officiate  V01
at  <ARG1
,  
or  
bless  V01
,  
same  
-  
gender  >ARGM-ADJ
marriages  V01
.  

Likewise  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
a  
denial  >>ARG0
of  
state  >ARGM-LOC
civil  >ARGM-MNR
recognition  V02
dishonors  V01
the  
religious  >ARG2
convictions  V02
of  
those  
communities  >>ARG0
and

who  >>R-ARG0
officiate  V01
at  <ARG1
,  
and  
bless  V01
,  
same  
-  
gender  >ARGM-ADJ
marriages  V01
.  

The  
state  
may  
not  
favor  
the  
convictions  V02
of  
one  
religious  
group  <ARG0
over  
another  
by  
denying  V01
individuals  <ARG2
their  >ARG1
fundamental  >ARGM-ADJ

As

we  >ARG0

to  
public  >ARG0
action  V02

The  
One  
Reason  >ARGM-CAU
Why  >R-ARGM-CAU
All  
Americans  >ARG0
Should  >ARGM-MOD
Oppose  V01
The  
Nomination  V01
Of  
Samuel  <ARG1
Alito  

He  >>>ARG0
Would  >ARGM-MOD
Tear  V05
Down  
Our  
System  <ARG1
Of  
Checks  V08
And  
Balances  
,  
Giving  V01
Far  
Too  
Much  
Power  <ARG1
To  
The  
President  <ARG2

My  
Fellow  
Americans  
:  

As  
many  >>ARG0
of  
you  
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
heard  V01
,  
President  >>ARG0
Bush  
has  V01
nominated  V01
a  
long  
-  
time  
Federal  
Judge  >>>ARG2
named  V01
Samuel  <ARG2
Alito  
to  
become  V01
the  
next  
member  <ARG2
of  
the  
United  
States  
Supreme  
Court  
,  
to  
fill  V01
a  
vacancy  >ARG1
created  V01
by  
the  
retirement  V01
of  
another  
member  <ARG0
of  
the  
Court  
.  

Under  
our  
Constitution  >>>ARGM-CAU
,  
this  
nomination  V01
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
take  VLV
effect  V01
unless  
and  
until  
the  
United  
States  
Senate  >ARG0
gives  V01
its  
Consent  <ARG1
,  
as  
described  V01
in  
our  
Constitution  <ARGM-LOC
,  
Article  
II  
,  
Section  
2  
.  

A  
copy  V01
of  
the  
Constitution  <ARG1
,  
with

the  
official

Judge  
Samuel  >ARG1
Alito  
is  V01
very  
highly  
qualified  <ARG2
by  
all  <ARGM-PRD
of  
the  
normal  
standards  >ARG1
used  V01
to  
evaluate  V01
candidates  <ARG1
for  
this  
position  
:  

He  >ARG0
has  V03
a  
very  
high  
intellect  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG1
graduated  V01
very  
high  <ARGM-ADV
in  
his  
class  <ARGM-LOC
,  
from  
Princeton  
undergraduate  <ARG0
and  
from  
Law  
School  
at  
Yale  
.  

He  >ARG0
has  V03
a  
long  
and  
distinguished  
record  <ARG1
,  
including  
many  
years  
as  
a  
Federal  
Appeals  
Judge  
,  
the  
next  
level  
below  
Supreme  
Court  
.  

He  >ARG0
has  V03
encyclopedic  
knowledge  <ARG1
of  
hundreds  
of  
different  >ARGM-ADJ
Supreme  
Court  >ARGM-LOC
cases  V03
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
recite  V01
details  <ARG1
from  
memory  <ARGM-MNR
.  

He  >>>ARG0
demonstrates  V01
an  
excellent  
"  
Judicial  
Temperament  <ARG1
,  
"  
being  V01
courteous  <ARG2
,  
mild  
-  
mannered  
,  
respectful  
of  
all  
people  
;  
careful  V04
in  
his  >ARG0
work  V01
,  
meticulous  
in  
detail  
.  

His  
co-workers  >ARG0
love  V01
him  <ARG1
.  

His  
fellow  
judges  >ARG0
love  V01
him  <ARG1
.  

His  
family  >ARG0
loves  V01
him  <ARG1
.  

President  >ARG0
Bush  
loves  V01
him  <ARG1
.  

Yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
it  
is  V01
true  V01
that  
some  
people  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like  V01
the  
way  >>ARGM-MNR
they  >ARG0
think  V01
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
vote  V01
on  
the  
Supreme  
Court  <ARG1
.  

But  
other  
people  >>ARG0
do  V01
like  V01
the  
way  >>ARGM-MNR
they  >ARG0
think  V01
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
vote  V01
,  
and  
the  
ones  >>>ARG1
who  >R-ARG0
favor  V01
him  <ARG1
seem  V01
to  
outnumber  V01
the  
ones  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
oppose  V01
him  <ARG1
.  

So  >>>ARGM-DIS
now  >>>ARGM-TMP
the  
Senate  >>>ARG0
is  V03
getting  V03
ready  V02
to  
vote  V01
soon  <ARGM-TMP
,  
on  
whether  
to  
approve  V01
him  <ARG1
or  
not  
;  
and  
at  
this  
moment  >ARGM-TMP
(  
evening  
of  
Jan.  
27  
,  
2006  
)  
it  >ARG0
looks  V02
like  
he  >ARG0
has  V03
more  <ARG1
than  
the  
fifty  
-  
one  >ARG2
votes  V01
needed  V01
for  
approval  V01
.  

The  
President  >>>ARG0
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
eager  V01
to  
go  V06
ahead  <ARG2
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
get  V01
this  
vote  V01
,  
because  
he  >>ARG0
very  
much  >ARGM-EXT
wants  V01
to  
have  V04
Samuel  >>ARG0
Alito  
on  
the  
Supreme  
Court  <ARG1
,  
to  
be  V03
judging  V01
the  
cases  V03
Bush  >>ARG1
is  V01
interested  V01
in  <C-ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
there  
is  V02
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
hurry  V01
-  
up  <ARGM-PRD
pressure  
on  
the  
Senate  
to  
give  V01
its  >ARG0
prompt  >ARGM-ADJ
vote  V01
of  
approval  V01
.  

There  
is  V02
an  
old  
saying  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
applies  V02
in  
this  
situation  <ARG2
:  
"  
Act  V02
in  
haste  <ARGM-MNR
,  
repent  V01
at  
leisure  <ARGM-TMP
.  
"  

Sometimes  >>>ARGM-TMP
you  >>>ARG0
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
make  VLV
a  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
decision  V01
very  
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
regret  V01
it  <ARG1
for  
many  
years  >ARG1
to  
come  V01
.  

That  >ARG1
is  V01
what  >>ARG1
is  V01
about  <ARG2
to  
happen  V01
with  
Judge  
Samuel  <<ARGM-ADV
Alito  
,  
in  
my  
opinion  <<<ARGM-ADV
,  
because  
he  >ARG0
has  V03
one  
tragic  >ARGM-ADJ
flaw  V01
-  
a  
very  
serious  
blind  
spot  
in  
his  >ARG0
thinking  V01
-  
which  >R-ARG0
makes  V02
him  >ARG1
completely  >ARGM-EXT
unacceptable  V01
for  
the  
position  <ARG3
of  
Supreme  
Court  
Justice  
:  
He  >>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-ADV
agree  V01
with  
the  
system  >>ARG1
of  
"  
Checks  V08
and  
Balances  
"  
built  V03
into  
the  
Constitution  <ARG2
,  
and  
he  >>>ARG0
is  V01
ready  V02
to  
start  V01
tearing  V05
it  <ARG1
down  <C-V
in  
order  
to  
follow  V02
the  
"  
Unitary  
Executive  
Theory  >ARG0
,  
"  
which  >R-ARG0
calls  V03
for  
vastly  
-  
increased  
Presidential  
Power  <ARG1
at  
the  
expense  
of  
Congress  
and  
the  
Supreme  
Court  
.  

And  
because  
of  
this  
tragic  >ARGM-ADJ
flaw  V01
.  
.  
.  

"  
He  >>>ARG0
Would  >ARGM-MOD
Tear  V05
Down  
Our  
System  <ARG1
Of  
Checks  V08
And  
Balances  
,  
Giving  V01
Far  
Too  
Much  
Power  <ARG1
To  
The  
President  <ARG2
.  
"  

In  
our  
Constitutional  
system  >ARGM-LOC
,  
we  >ARG0
have  V03
three  
branches  <ARG1
of  
the  
Federal  
Government  
:  
the  
Legislative  
,  
Executive  
,  
and  
Judicial  
branches  
.  

And  >>>ARGM-DIS
the  
basic  
idea  >>>ARG1
behind  
the  
Checks  V08
and  
Balances  
we  >ARG0
have  V03
is  V01
that  
if  
one  
branch  >>ARG1
of  
the  
Government  
goes  V08
crazy  V03
,  
the  
other  
two  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
hold  V01
it  <ARG1
down  <ARGM-ADV
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
Samuel  >ARG0
Alito  
believes  V01
in  
a  
little  
-  
known  
Constitutional  
theory  >>ARG0
-  
called  V01
the  
"  
Unitary  
Executive  
Theory  <ARG2
"  
-  
which  >R-ARG0
says  V01
that  
the  
President  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have  VLV
complete  >ARGM-EXT
control  V01
over  
the  
Executive  
Branch  <ARG1
,  
and  
that  
the  
Executive  
Branch  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
in  
charge  V08
of  
almost  
everything  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
the  
Government  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
does  V02
,  
including  
the  
functions  V01
of  
the  
Independent  
Agencies  >>>ARG1
which  >>>R-ARG1
were  V03
designed  V01
to  
be  V01
free  V04
of  
Presidential  >ARG0
control  V01
,  
and  
the  
Military  >>>ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
exists  V01
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V03
regulated  V01
,  
and  
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V03
funded  V01
by  
specific  
authority  >ARG1
given  V01
by  
the  
Constitution  <ARG0
to  
Congress  <ARG2
,  
not  
to  
the  
President  
.  

The  
Military  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
Executive  
Branch  
:  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
separate  
entity  <ARG2
.  

"  
Commander  >>ARG1
In  
Chief  
"  
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
mean  V01
that  
he  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
boss  <ARG2
of  
the  
Military  
,  
merely  
that  
he  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
Administrator  <ARG2
,  
just  
as  
he  >>ARG1
is  V01
the  
Administrator  <ARG2
of  
the  
Executive  
Branch  
,  
charged  V08
with  
"  
executing  V02
faithfully  <ARGM-MNR
"  
all  
the  
laws  >ARG1
passed  V01
by  
Congress  <ARG0
and  
all  
the  
Decisions  V01
rendered  V02
by  
the  
Supreme  
Court  <ARG0
.  

Under  
the  
Unitary  
Executive  
Theory  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
Laws  >>ARG0
of  
Congress  
and  
Decisions  V01
of  
the  
Supreme  
Court  <ARG0
have  V03
no  
actual  
authority  <ARG1
unless  
the  
President  >ARG0
agrees  V01
with  
them  <ARG2
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
so  >ARGM-DIS
Congress  >ARG1
and  
the  
Supreme  
Court  
become  V01
mere  
advisors  <ARG2
to  
the  
President  
,  
with  
no  
real  
authority  
over  
him  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
the  
President  >ARG1
becomes  V01
a  
Dictator  >ARG1
,  
unrestrained  
by  
anything  
in  
the  
Constitution  
,  
backed  V04
up  
by  
the  
Armed  
Forces  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
entirely  
under  
his  >ARG0
personal  >ARGM-ADJ
control  V01
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
thus  >ARGM-DIS
the  
United  
States  >ARG1
of  
America  
-  
The  
Land  
Of  
The  
Free  
And  
The  
Home  
Of  
The  
Brave  
-  
becomes  V01
just  <ARG2
another  
Military  
Dictatorship  <ARG2
,  
no  
better  
than  
Nazi  
Germany  
or  
Fascist  
Italy  
during  
World  
War  
II  
.  

AND  >ARGM-DIS
THAT  >ARG1
IS  V01
WHY  >ARGM-PRP
ALL

SHOULD  >ARGM-MOD

THE

Pike  >ARG1
's

something  <ARG1

If  
I  >ARG0
love  V01
cats  <ARG1
so  
much  <ARGM-EXT
,  
why  >>ARGM-CAU
are  V03
n't  >ARGM-NEG
I  >ARG0
DOING  V02
something  <ARG1
???  

I  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
appear  V01
before  
God  <ARGM-LOC
on  
judgment  
day  <ARGM-TMP

have  V02
to  
explain  V01
why  >>ARGM-CAU
I  >>ARG0

Here  >ARG2

the  
email  V01
:  

Hi  
there  
,  

I  >ARG0
read  V01
the  
Civet  
Cat  
story  <ARG1
from  
a  
little  
while  
ago  
,  
and  
tonight  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
my  
Mom  >ARG0
emailed  V01
me  <ARG2
about  
it  <ARG1
,  
I  >>ARG0
re-read  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
went  V02
to  
the  
website  <ARG4
with  
the  
song  >>ARG1
the  
author  >>ARG0
of  
the  
email  V01
created  V01
.  

Well  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
sure  >>>ARGM-ADV
enough  
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
heard  V01
the  
cats  >ARG0
"  
Meowing  V01
,  
"  
I  >>>ARG0
imagined  V01
the  
hellish  
moments  >>ARG1
these  
poor  
beautiful  
creatures  >>ARG0
of  
God  
were  V03
living  V01
,  
what  >ARG1
went  V15
on  
in  
their  
tiny  
,  
sweet  
little  
minds  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
decided  V01
that  
I  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
do  V02
something  <ARG1
about  
this  
torture  V01
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
anyone  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
me  <ARG2
some  
advice  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
sure  >ARGM-ADV
appreciate  V02
it  <ARG1
!  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
for  
starters  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
myself  >>ARG0
and  
those  >ARG0
of  
you  
who  >R-ARG0
believe  V01
in  
God  <ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
a  
special  
prayer  <ARG1
for  
them  
.  

I  
will  
.  

I  >>ARG0
've  V01
pasted  V01
the  
email  V01
for  
those  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
have  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seen  V01
or  
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
re-read  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG0
's  V03
also  >ARGM-ADV
got  V02
the  
website  >>>ARG2
where  >>>R-ARG2
the  
song  >>>ARG1
has  V01
been  V03
uploaded  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
was  V03
thinking  V01
,  
that  
while  
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V03
sitting  V01
here  <ARG2
,  
relaxing  V01
and  
enjoying  V01
myself  <ARG1
,  
those  
poor  
innocent  
animals  >>>ARG1
are  V03
being  V03
cooked  V01
to  
death  V01
with  
heat  <<ARGM-MNR
in  
those  
Holocaust-esque  
death  
chambers  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

And  
what  >>ARG1
am  V03
I  >ARG0
DOING  V02
about  
it  <ARG2

This  >ARG1

my  
first  
time  <ARG2
posting  V01
to  
the  
list  <ARG2
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG1
feel  V01
somewhat  >ARGM-EXT
embarrassed  V01
by  
"  
promoting  V02
"  
a  
song  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
wrote  V01
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
it  >ARG1
is  V01
fitting  <ARG2
because  
it  >>ARG1
is  V03
directly  >ARGM-MNR
tied  V01
to  
extreme  >ARGM-EXT
animal  >ARG0
suffering  V01
as  
a  
result  <ARGM-CAU
of  
human  >ARG0
lack  V01
of  
empathy  <ARG1
,  
but  
an  
abundance  
of  
human  
greed  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure  V02
if  
any  >ARG0

but  
to  
brief  V01
those  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
,  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
quote  V01
James  <ARG2
Rachels  
,  
author  
of  
World

among  
many

)  
.  

The  
quote  V01
is  V01
from  
an  
article  >ARG1
entitled  V02
"  
Vegetarianism  <ARG2
and  
`

Other

If  
anyone  >ARG0
wants  V01
the  
complete  
article  <ARG1
,  
email  V01
me  <ARG2
,  
as  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
very  
good  
article  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1

can  >>ARGM-MOD
read  V01
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
sense  V01
their  
own  
hypocrisy  <ARG1
.  

But  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
what  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
says  V01
about  
civet  
cats  <ARG3
:  

"  
As  
an  
example  >ARGM-ADV
,  
consider  V02
the  
treatment  V01
of  
the  
civet  
cat  <ARG1
,  
a  
highly  
intelligent  
and  
sociable  
animal  
.  

Civet  
cats  >>>ARG1
are  V03
trapped  V01
and  
placed  V01
in  
small  
cages  <ARG2
inside  
darkened  V01
sheds  >>ARGM-LOC
,  
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
the  
temperature  >>ARG1
is  V03
kept  V02
up  
to  
110  
F  <ARG2
by  
fires  V05
.  

They  >>ARG1
are  V03
confined  V01
in  
this  
way  <ARGM-MNR
until  
they  >ARG1
finally  >ARGM-TMP
die  V01
.  

What  >ARG0
justifies  V01
this  
extraordinary  
mistreatment  <ARG1
?  

These  
animals  >ARG0
have  V03
the  
misfortune  <ARG1
to  
produce  V01
a  
substance  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
useful  V05
in  
the  
manufacture  <ARG2
of  
perfume  
.  

Musk  >>>ARG0
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V03
scraped  V01
from  
their  
genitals  <ARG2

day  
for  
as  
long  <ARGM-TMP
as  
they  
can  
surv  
ive  
,  
makes  V02
the  
scent  >ARG1
of  
perfume  
last  V01
a  
bit  
longer  <ARG2
after  
each  
application  V03
.  

(  
The  
heat  >ARG0
increases  V01
their  >ARG0

production  V01

of  
musk  <ARG1

)  

Here  >>>ARGM-LOC
Kant  >ARG0

rule  V01
--  
"

thousands  >>ARG1

for  
their  
whole  
lives  <ARGM-TMP

"  

This  
article  >ARG0
,  
and  
specifically  
this  
piece  
,  
effected  V01
me  <ARG1
enough  <ARGM-EXT
to  
try  V01
to  
build  V01
a  
song  <ARG1
around  
the  
topic  <ARGM-LOC
.  

If  
anyone  >>ARG1
is  V01
interested  V01
in  
listening  V01
to  
this  
song  <ARG1

and  
in  
offering  V01
their  
opinion  <ARG1
,  
whether  
it  >>>ARG0
be  V01
positive  V02
or  
negative  V03
,  
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
appreciate  V02
it  <ARG1
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
hope  V01
no  
one  >ARG0
feels  V01
any  
obligation  V01
to  
download  V01
,  
especially  
if  
you  >>ARG0
have  V03
an  
internet  >ARG2

as  
slow  <ARGM-ADJ
mine  
(

The  
url  >ARG1
for  
the  
song  
is  V01

Although  
there  
are  V02
no

lyrics  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
it's  
subject  
matter  >>ARG1
is  V01
audible  V02
.  

Again  >>>ARGM-DIS

if  
anyone  >>ARG0

to  
read  V01
Rachels

It  >ARG1

also  <ARGM-ADV
on

I  >ARG1
was  V01
already  <ARGM-TMP
a  
vegetarian  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
read  V01
it  <ARG1
a  
little  
more  
than  
a  
year  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
bigger  
factors  
for  
me  
in  
going  V08
completely  
vegan  <ARG2

THIS  >ARG1
IS  V01
NOT  <ARGM-NEG
A  
SCAM  V01
!!!  

I  >>>ARG0
found  V01
this  <ARG1
on  
a  
bulletin  
board  <ARGM-LOC
and  
decided  V01
to  
try  V01
it  <ARG1
:  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
care  V01
about  
the  
useless  
pre-fabricated  
crap  >ARG1
this

.  

All  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
say  V01

it  >ARG1

Continue  V01
pre-fab  
crap  <ARG1
.  

WELL  >ARGM-DIS
GUESS  V01
WHAT  <ARG1
!!!  

Within  
seven  
days  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
started  V01
getting  V01
money  <ARG1
in  
the  
mail  <ARGM-MNR
!!  

I  >>ARG1
was  V01
shocked  V01
!!  

I  >ARG0
figured  V01
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
end  V01
soon  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
the  
money  >>ARG1
just  >ARGM-ADV
kept  V02
coming  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
.  

In  
my  
first  
week  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
made  V05
about  
$  <ARG1
25.00  
.  

By  
the  
end  V01
of  
the  
second  
week  <ARG1
I  >>ARG0
had  V01
made  V05
a  
total  <ARG1
of  
more  
than  
$  
1000.00  
!!  

In  
the  
third  
week  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
had  V03
more  
than  
$  <ARG1
10,000.00  
and  
it  >>ARG1
's  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
growing  V01

This  >ARG1

now  <ARGM-TMP
my  
fourth

and  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01

a  
total  <ARG1
of  
$  
42,000.00  
and  
it  >>ARG1
's  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
coming  V01
rapidly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
certainly  <ARGM-ADV
worth  
$  <ARG2
6.00  
and  
six  
stamps  
,  
and  
I  >>>ARG0

spent  V01
more  <ARG3

You  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
now  >ARGM-TMP
become  V01
a  
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
Mail  >ARGM-MNR
Order  V02
business  
.  

You  >ARG1
are  V01
in  
the  
business  <ARG2
of  
developing  V02
Mailing  
Lists  <ARG1
.  

Many  
large  
corporations  >>>ARG0
are  V01
happy  V01
to  
pay  V01
big  
bucks  <ARG1
for  
quality  
lists  <ARG3
.  

However  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
money  >>>ARG1
made  V05
from  
the  
mailing  
lists  <ARG2
is  V01
secondary  V01
to  
income  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V03
made  V05
from  
people  >>>ARG1
like  
you  
and  
me  
asking  V02
to  
be  V03
included  V01
in  
that  
list  <ARG2
.  

Here  >ARG2
are  V01
the  
four  
easy  >ARGM-ADJ
steps  V01
to  
success  V01
.  

STEP  
ONE  
:  

Get  V01
six  
separate  
pieces  <ARG1
of  
paper  
and  
write  V01
the  
following  <ARG1
on  
each  
piece  <ARGM-LOC
of  
paper  
"  
PLEASE  >ARGM-DIS
PUT  V01
ME  <ARG1
ON  
YOUR  
MAILING  
LIST  <ARG2
.  
"  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
get  V01
6  
U.S.  
$  
1.00  
bills  <ARG1
and  
place  V01
ONE  <ARG1
inside  
of  
EACH  <ARG2
of  
the  
six  
pieces  
of  
paper  
so  
the  
bill  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
seen  V01
through  
the  
envelope  <ARGM-DIR
(  
to  
prevent  V01
thievery  <ARG1
)  
.  

Next  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
place  V01
one  
paper  <ARG1
in  
each  <ARG2
of  
the  
six  
envelopes  
and  
seal  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
should  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
six  
sealed  V01
envelopes  <ARG1
,  
each  <<ARGM-PRD
with  
a  
piece  >ARG0
of  
paper  
stating  V01
the  
above  
phrase  <ARG1
,  
your  
name  
and  
address  
,  
and  
a  
$  
1.00  
bill  
.  

What  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
are  V03
doing  V02
is  V01
creating  V01
a  
service  V01
.  

THIS  >>ARG1
IS  V01
ABSOLUTELY  >ARGM-ADV
LEGAL  V02
!!!!  
!  

You  >>ARG0
are  V03
requesting  V01
a  
legitimate  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V01
and  
you  >>ARG0
are  V03
paying  V01
for  
it  <ARG3
!!  

Like  
most  >>>ARGM-ADV
of  
us  
I  >>>ARG1
was  V01
a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
skeptical  V01
and  
little  >ARGM-EXT
worried  V01
about  
the  
legal  
aspects  <ARG0
of  
it  
all  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
checked  V05
it  <ARG1
out  <C-V
with  
the  
U.S.  
Post  
Office  <ARGM-MNR
(  
1-800-238-5355  
)  
and  
they  >ARG0
confirmed  V01
that  
it  >>ARG1
is  V01
indeed  >ARGM-ADV
legal  V02
!!

STEP  
TWO  
:  
Now  >>>ARGM-TMP
take  V07
the  
#  
1  
name  <ARG1
off  <C-V
the  
list  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
you  >ARG0
see  V01
above  <ARGM-LOC
,  
move  V01
the  
other  
names  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-DIR
(  
six  >ARG1
becomes  V01
5  <ARG2
,  
5  >ARG1
becomes  V01

,  
and  
etc.  
)  
and  
add  V02
YOUR  
NAME  <ARG1
as  
number  <ARGM-PRD
6  
on  
the  
list  
.  

STEP  
THREE  
:  

Change  V01
anything  <ARG1
you  >ARG0
need  V01
to  <ARG1
but  
try  V01
to  
keep  V02
this  
article  >ARG1
as  >ARGM-CXN
close  V10
to  
original  <ARG2
as  
possible  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
post  V01
your  
amended  
article  <ARG1
to  
at  
least  
200  
news  
groups  <ARG2
.  
:  

(  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
there  
are  V02
close  
to  
24,000  
groups  <ARG1
)  

All  >>ARG1
you  >ARG0
need  V01
is  V01
200  <ARG2
,  
but  
remember  V01
,  
the  
more  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
post  V01
,  
the  
more  
money  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
make  V05
!!  

This  >>ARG1
is  V01
perfectly  >ARGM-ADV
legal  V02
!!  

If  
you  >>ARG0
have  VLV
any  
doubts  V01
,  
refer  V03
to  
Title  <ARG1
18  
Sec.  
1302  
&  
1341  
of  
the  
Postal  
Lottery  
laws  
.  

Keep  V01
a  
copy  V01
of  
these  
steps  V01
for  
yourself  <<ARGM-GOL
and  
whenever  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
need  V01
money  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
use  V01
it  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
again  
.  

PLEASE  >ARGM-DIS
REMEMBER  V01
that  
this  
program  >>ARG0
remains  V01
successful  V01
because  
of  
the  
honesty  <ARGM-CAU
and  
integrity  
of  
the  
participants  
and  
by  
their  >ARG0
carefully  >ARGM-MNR
adhering  V02
to  
directions  V01
.  

Look  V01
at  
it  <ARG1
this  
way  <ARGM-MNR
.  

If  
you  >ARG1
were  V01
of  
integrity  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
program  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
continue  V01
and  
the  
money  >>>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG1
so  
many  
others  >>ARG0
have  V01
received  V01
will  >>ARGM-MOD
come  VLV
your  >ARG1
way  V01
.  

NOTE  
:  
You  >>>ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
want  V01
to  
retain  V01
every  
name  >ARG1
and  
address  
sent  V01
to  
you  <ARG2
,  
either  
on  
a  
computer  <<ARGM-LOC
or  
hard  >ARGM-MNR
copy  V01
and  
keep  V01
the  
notes  >ARG1
people  >ARG0
send  V01
you  <ARG2
.  

This  >ARG0
VERIFIES  V01
that  
you  >>ARG0
are  V03
truly  >ARGM-ADV
providing  V01
a  
service  V01
.  

(  
Also  >ARGM-DIS
,  
it  
might  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
good  
idea  <ARG2
to  
wrap  V01
the  
$  
1  
bill  <ARG1
in  
dark  
paper  <ARG2
to  
reduce  V01
the  
risk  V01
of  
mail  
theft  <ARG1
)  
.  

So  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
as  
each  
post  V01
is  V01
downloaded  V01
and  
the  
directions  V01
carefully  >ARGM-MNR
followed  V02
,  
all  
members  >>ARG2
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
reimbursed  V01
for  
their  >ARG0
participation  V01
as  
a  
List  
Developer  <ARGM-PRD
with  
one  
dollar  <<ARG1
each  
.  

Your  
name  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
move  V01
up  
the  
list  <ARG2
geometrically  <ARGM-MNR
so  
that  
when  >ARGM-TMP
your  
name  >ARG0
reaches  V01
the  
#  
1  
position  <ARG1
you  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
receiving  V01
thousands  <ARG1
of  
dollars  
in  
CASH  
!!!  

What  
an  
opportunity  
for  
only  
$  
6.00  
(  
$  
1.00  
for  
each  
of  
the  
first  
six  
people  >ARG1
listed  V01
above  <ARGM-LOC
)  

Send  V01
it  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
add  V02
your  
own  
name  <ARG1
to  
the  
list  <ARG2
and  
you  >ARG1
're  V01
in  
business  <ARG2

STEP

re-type  V01
this

--  

Ever  
since  
he  >>ARG0
ate  V02
up  
Red  
Riding  
Hood  
's  
grandma  <ARG1
and  
blew  V01
down  <ARGM-DIR
the  
houses  <ARG1
of  
two  
-  
thirds  
of  
the  
Three  
Little  
Pigs  
,  
the  
Big  
Bad  
Wolf  >>ARG0
has  V01
held  V01
a  
persistently  
bad  
reputation  <ARG1
.  

In  
part  
because  
of  
that  
reputation  >>ARGM-CAU
,  
the  
gray  
wolf  >>ARG1
was  V03
nearly  >ARGM-ADV
exterminated  V01
from  
the  
lower  
48  
states  <ARGM-LOC
by  
the  
1920s  <ARGM-TMP
,  
except  
for  
a  
small  >ARGM-ADJ
remnant  >ARGM-ADJ
population  V01
on  
Isle  
Royale  
National  
Park  <ARG1
in  
Michigan  
's  
Lake  
Superior  
.  

The  
last  
wolf  >>ARG1
was  V03
killed  V01
in  
Yellowstone  
National  
Park  <ARGM-LOC
in  
1943  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Western  
sheep  
and  
cattle  
ranchers  >>>ARG0
,  
on  
whose  
behalf  >>>R-ARGM-GOL
this  
extermination  >ARG1
campaign  V01
was  V03
conducted  V01
,  
gratefully  >>ARGM-ADV
dusted  V02
their  
hands  <ARG1
of  
the  
wolf  <ARGM-PRD
and  
wrote  V08
him  <ARG1
off  <C-V
as  
a  
job  >ARG1
well  >ARGM-MNR
done  V02
.  

Their  
sheep  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
graze  V01
,  
their  
cows  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
ruminate  V01
and  
never  >>ARGM-NEG
a  
discouraging  
word  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
heard  V01
.  

After  
the  
major  >ARGM-ADJ
kill  V02
-  
offs  >ARGM-TMP
,  
wolves  >ARG1
outside  
of  
Alaska  
and  
Canada  
existed  V01
mostly  
as  
legend  <ARG2
.  

Like  
UFOs  >ARGM-ADV
or  
Sasquatch  
,  
several  
people  >>ARG0
claimed  V01
to  
see  V01
fleeting  
lone  
wolves  <ARG1
,  
usually  
in  
Yellowstone  <ARGM-LOC
.  

In  
the  
1960s  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
a  
group  >>>ARG0
shooting  V03
a  
movie  <ARG2
in  
the  
Wyoming  
park  <ARGM-LOC
reportedly  >>ARGM-ADV
imported  V01
some  
captive  
wolves  <ARG1
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
released  V01
them  <ARG1
when  >>>ARGM-TMP
their  >ARG0
shooting  V03
was  V01
done  V08
.  

If  
so  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
this  
happy  
band  >>>ARG2
has  V01
not  >>ARGM-NEG
been  V03
heard  V01
from  <C-ARG2
since  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Rumor  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
had  V03
it  <ARG1
some  
renegade  
biologist  >>>ARG0
brought  V01
a  
caged  V01
pair  <ARG1
to  
Yellowstone  <<ARG2
and  
released  V01
them  <ARG1
into  
the  
wild  <ARGM-DIR
sometime  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
1970s  
,  
hoping  V01
to  
reestablish  V01
a  
breeding  >ARGM-PRD
population  V01
.  

If  
true  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
caper  >ARG2
failed  V01
.  

Over  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
wolf  >ARG1
's  
absence  V01
seemed  V01
to  
rehabilitate  V01
its  
image  <ARG1
.  

Eventually  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
a  
trickle  >>ARG1
of  
support  V01
appeared  V01
for  
bringing  V01
the  
predator  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
to  
its  
former  
home  
range  
in  
the  
northern

This  
trickle  >ARG1
grew  V01
into  
a  
flood  V01
,  
resulting  V01
in  
14  
wolves  >>ARG1
being  V03
reintroduced  V02
in  
Yellowstone  <ARG2
in  
1995  <ARGM-TMP
by  
the  
U.S.  
Fish

Wildlife

--  
albeit  
over  
the  
strong  >ARGM-ADJ
and  
still  
-  
continuing  
objections  V01
of  
ranchers  <ARG0
.  

These  
wolf  
packs  >>ARG1
have  V01
flourished  V01
,  
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
there  
are  V02
an  
estimated  
850  
wolves  >ARG0
roaming  V01
the  
northern  
Rockies  >ARGM-LOC
,  
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
merely  
10  
years  
ago  >ARGM-TMP
there  
were  V02
none  <ARG1
.  

One  
compelling  >ARGM-ADJ
argument  V01
for  
reintroduction  V01
was  V01
the  
wolf  >ARG0
acts  V01
as  
a  
keystone  
predator  <ARG1
,  
an  
animal  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
affects  V01
the  
populations  V01
,  
behavior  
and  
ecology  
of  
a  
wide  
variety  <ARG2
of  
species  
within  
its  
range  
.  

Some  
recent  >ARGM-TMP
research  V01
conducted  V01
by  
Oregon  
State  
University  <ARG0
has  V01
given  V01
considerable  
credence  <ARG1
to  
this  
idea  <ARG2
.  

OSU  
forestry  
professors  
William  >>ARG0
Ripple  
and  
Robert  
Beschta  
have  V01
found  V01
that  
wolves  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
promote  V02
stream  
-  
bank  >ARG1
stabilization  V01
,  
although  
they  >>ARG0
have  V01
given  V01
the  
phenomenon  <ARG2
the  
unfortunate  
name  <ARG1
of  
"  
the  
ecology  
of  
fear  V01
"  
--  
something  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
smacks  V01
of  
the  
horrible  
PR  >ARG2
resulting  V01
from  
the  
wolf  >ARG0
's  
relationships  V03
with  
Riding  
Hood  <ARG2
and  
the  
Three  
Pigs  
.  

They  >ARG0
explained  V01
that  
elk  >>ARG0
in  
Yellowstone  
used  V03
to  
browse  V01
unmolested  <ARGM-PRD
on  
young  
aspen  >ARG1
and  
willow  
growing  V01
near  
the  
banks  <ARGM-LOC
of  
streams  V02
,  
a  
behavior  >>>ARG0
that  >>>R-ARG0
prevented  V01
the  
saplings  >ARG0
from  
reaching  V01
mature  
stages  <ARG1
and  
increased  V01
the  
possibility  <ARG1
of  
soil  >ARG1
erosion  V01
.  

Since  
reintroduction  V01
,  
however  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
Ripple  >>ARG0
and  
Beschta  
have  V01
found  V01
,  
fear  V01
of  
the  
wolves  <ARG1
apparently  >>ARGM-ADV
has  V01
discouraged  V01
the  
elk  >>>ARG0
from  
spending  V02
too  
much  
time  <ARG1
at  
stream  
banks  >ARGM-LOC
--  
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
they  >ARG1
are  V01
out  <ARG2
in  
the  
open  
--  
and  
munching  V01
on  
the  
saplings  <ARG1
.  

"  
All  >>>ARG1

has  V01
triggered  V01

cascade  <ARG1
in  
Yellowstone  <ARGM-LOC

she  >ARG0

Parmesan  >>>ARG0
has  V01
spent  V02
much  <ARG1
of  
her  
career  
studying  V01
the  
checkerspot  
butterfly  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
migrates  V01
between  
Mexico  <ARG1
and  
southern  
California  
.  

Some  
localized  >ARGM-PRD
extinctions  V01
already  >>ARGM-TMP
have  V01
occurred  V01
across  
some  <ARGM-LOC
of  
its  
habitat  
.  

"  
Empirical  >ARGM-MNR
research  V01
pointed  V01
to  
climate  <ARG2
as  
being  V01
a  
strong  
driver  <ARG2
,  
"  
she  >ARG0
said  V01
.  

"  
There  
have  V01
been  V02
large

"  

According  
to  
Parmesan  >ARG0
's  
earlier  >ARGM-TMP
studies  V01
,  
one  
extinction  
event  >>ARG1
,  
for  
instance  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
was  V03
triggered  V01
when  >>>ARGM-TMP
a  
checkerspot  >ARG2
population  V01
migrated  V01
north  <ARG1
prematurely  <ARGM-TMP
,  
relying  V01
on  
a  
warming  >ARGM-ADJ
temperature  >ARG1
signal  V07
,  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
was  V03
caught  V03
in  
a  
severe  
snowstorm  <ARG2
in  
its  
northern  
habitat  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Throughout  
the  
United

she  >ARG0
said  V01
,  <C-ARG1-DSP
"  
spring  >>ARG1

Tree  
swallows  >>ARG0

nesting  V01

Tropical  
species  >>ARG1

the  
Gulf

up  <ARGM-DIR
from  
Mexico  <ARG3
and  
the  
Caribbean  
.  
"  

As  
the  
Pew  >ARG0
report  V01
concluded  V01
,  
"  
Sufficient  >ARGM-ADJ
studies  V01
now  >ARGM-TMP
exist  V01
to  
conclude  V01
that  
the  
consequences  >>ARG1
of  
climate  >ARG1
change  V01
are  V01
already  <ARGM-TMP
detectable  <ARG2
within  
U.S.  
ecosystems  <ARGM-LOC

"  

Such  
consequences  >ARG2
include  V01
shifting  V01
and  
,  
in  
some  
cases  V04
,  
contraction  V01

The  
report  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS

alterations  V01
of  
ecosystem  >ARG1
processes  V02
such  
as  
carbon  >>ARG1
cycling  V02
and  
storage  V01

The  
Alaskan  
tundra  >>ARG1

it  >ARG0

(  
releasing  V01
more  
carbon  <ARG1

because  
warmer

Now  
to

You  >ARG0
know  V01
,  
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
lived  V01
in  
the  
Dallas  
/  
Fort  
Worth  
Metroplex  <ARGM-LOC
most  <ARGM-TMP
of  
my  
life  
.  

When  
not

Texas  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
lived  V01
in  
LA  <ARGM-LOC
and  
San  
Francisco  
.  

There  
is  V02
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
racial  
diversity  
in  
all  <ARGM-LOC
of  
these  
places  
...  
and  
I  >>>ARG0
've  V01
vacationed  V01

visited  V01
my

when  >ARGM-TMP

lived  V01
in

and  
where  >>ARGM-LOC
they  >>>ARG1

are  V01
in

(  
less  V02
than  <ARG2
20  
%  <ARG2
)  
in  
northeastern  
Arkansas  <<<ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
fact  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
began  V02
traveling  V01
for  
business  <ARGM-PRP
to  
New  
England  <ARG1
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
visited  V01
my  
in  
-  
laws  <ARG1
in  
Montana  <ARGM-LOC

Idaho  
,  
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
shocked  V01
at  
the  
lack  V01
of  
racial  
diversity  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
expect  V01
to  
react  V01
that  
way  V01
,  
but  
when  >>>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
looking  V01
around  
my  
workplace  <ARG1
in  
Nashua  <ARGM-LOC
,  
New  
Hampshire  
,  
and  
everyone  >ARG0
else  
looked  V02
pretty  
much  
like  
me  <ARG1
,  
it  
was  V01
really  <ARGM-EXT
very  
eerie  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
,  
yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
America  >ARG0
has  V03
pockets  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
are  V01
more  
diverse  <ARG2
than  
others  
.  

Additionally  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
reviewing  V01
the  
standings  <ARG1

Louisiana  
and  
Mississippi  
in  
the  
educational

,  
you  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD

they  >ARG0

land  V01
near  
the  
bottom  <ARGM-LOC

to  
be  V03
filmed  V01
,  
where  V01
those  <ARG2
without  
transportation  V01
or  
means  
.  

Some  >>ARG0
refused  V01
to  
leave  V11
,  
but  
so  
many  >>ARG1

unable  V01
to  <ARG2
.  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
valid  >ARGM-ADJ

of  
America  <ARG2

we  >>ARG0

cities  <ARG1
like  
this

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
New

also  >ARGM-DIS

many  
affluent  
people  <ARG1

left  V11
town  <ARG1
early  <ARGM-TMP

they  >ARG0

the

.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG

this  >ARG0

I  >ARG0
suspect  V01
it  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
change  V01
greatly  <ARGM-EXT
...  
but  
you  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
how  
much  
stock  >ARG1

put  V01
in

know  V01
that  
this  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
change  V01

face  <ARG1
of  
America  
.  

I  >ARG0
expect  V01
that  
many  >ARG1
of  
the  
displaced  
people  
(  
those  
affluent  
and  
those  
not  
)  
will  >ARGM-MOD
remain  V01
in  
the  
places  >>ARGM-DIR
they  >>ARG2
were  V03
evacuated  V01
to  <C-ARGM-DIR

The  
1.25  
million  
people  >>>ARG0

have  V01
been  V03
housed  V01
in  
stadiums  <ARG2

convention

across  
Texas  
will  >ARGM-MOD
begin  V02

populate  V01

,  
Dallas  
,  
San  
Antonio  
and  
Galveston  
,  
and  
the  
surrounding  
areas  
.  

Sure  >ARGM-DIS
,  
some  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
return  V01
,  
but  
I  >>ARG0
have  VLV
a  
feeling  V02
that  
once  
many  >>ARG0
begin  V02
to  
get  V01
jobs  <ARG1

temporary  >ARGM-ADJ
housing  V01
,  
they  >>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD

shy  V04
about  
returning  V01

I  >>ARG1
'm  V01

what  >ARG1

look  V02

their  >ARG0

really  >>ARGM-ADV

my

slanted  <ARG2

I  >ARG0

that  <ARG1

I  >ARG0
rarely  >ARGM-ADV

to  
the

to  
what  >ARG1

because  
so  
many  >ARG0

what  >ARG2
's  V01
the  
point  <ARG1

What  >>ARG1

that

a  
close

aunt  >ARG1
disappeared  V01
in  
New

My  
friend  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
computer  
capability  <ARG1
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >>>ARG0
spent  V02
the  
day  <ARG1
searching  V01
and  
posting  V01
online  <ARG2
.  

The  
family  >>ARG0
here  
(  
California

wanted  V01
to  
fly  V01
any  
family  
members  <ARG1
from  
there  
to  
CA  <ARGM-DIR
,  
so  
they  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
remain  V01
here  <ARG3
until  
things  >>ARG1
got  V03
straightened  V02
out  
down  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
cousins  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
found  V01
because  
no  
one  >>ARG0
was  V01
sure  V02
of  
their  
married  
names  <ARG1

The  
hope  V01
was  V01
that  
anyone  >>>ARG0

for  
the

the

know  V01

help  V01
was  V01

It  >ARG1

Oct.  <ARG2
6  
,  
and  
not  
one

What  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0

was  V01
dozens  <ARG2

school

that  >>>R-ARG1
could  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V03
used  V01
to  
evacuate  V01
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
had  VLV
no  >ARGM-NEG
transportation  V01
.  

What  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
heard  V01
was  V01
the  
Mayor  >ARG0
of  
New

,  
saying  V01
that  
he  >>ARG0

n't  >ARGM-NEG
order  V01
the  
buses  >>ARG1

anything

he  >>ARG1

legal  
mumbo  
jumbo  
what  >>ARG2
have  V01
we  >ARG1

?  

Recently  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Bush  >ARG0
addressed  V01
the  
nation  <ARG2
.  

About  
30  
seconds  >>ARGM-TMP
into  
his  >ARG0

,  
he  >>ARG0
started  V01
flogging  V01
the  
terrorist  >ARG0
issue  V02
just  
one  
more  
time  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

Ironically  >ARGM-ADV
he  >>ARG0
almost  >ARGM-ADV
burst  V04
out  
laughing  V01
and  
it  
was  V01
all  >ARG1

to  
keep  V04
his  
mirth  <ARG1
down  <ARG2

a  
barely

Even  
he  >ARG0

trotting  V02
out  
this

I  >ARG0
guess  V01
if  
you  >ARG0

a

that  >R-ARG1

a

,  
every

the

again  <ARGM-TMP

The  
gall  >ARG1

it  
all

that

when  >>ARGM-TMP
what  >>ARG1

pour  V01

True

but  
two  >>ARG1

that  >R-ARG1

know  V01

a

father  
,  
the

had  V01
apparently  >ARGM-ADV

be  V01
sure  V01
,  
both  
Lopez  >ARG1

were  V01
conversos  <ARG2

his  
master  
dragged  V01
me  <ARG1
to  
my  
room  <ARG2
and  
held  V02
judgment  V01
upon  
me  <ARG1
as  
a  
convicted  
traitress  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

Then  >>ARGM-ADV
and  
there  
they  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
plunged  V02
their  
knives  <ARG1
into  
me  <ARG2
could  >>ARGM-MOD
they  >>ARG0
have  V01
seen  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
escape  V01
the  
consequences  <ARG1
of  
the  
deed  
.  

Finally  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
after  
much  >ARGM-EXT
debate  V01
,  
they  >ARG0
concluded  V01
that  
my  >ARG1
murder  V01
was  V01
too  >ARGM-EXT
dangerous  V01
.  

But  
they  >>>ARG0
determined  V01
to  
get  VLV
rid  V01
forever  <ARGM-TMP
of  
Garcia  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
had  V01
gagged  V01
me  <ARG1
,  
and  
Murillo  >ARG0
twisted  V01
my  
arm  <ARG1
round  <ARGM-DIR
until  
I  >ARG0
gave  V01
him  <ARG2
the  
address  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
swear  V04
that  
he  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
twisted  V01
it  <ARG1
off  <ARGM-DIR
had  
I  >ARG0
understood  V01
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
mean  V01
to  
Garcia  <ARG3
.  

Lopez  >>>ARG0
addressed  V01
the  
note  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
had  V01
written  V01
,  
sealed  V01
it  <ARG1
with  
his  
sleeve  
-  
link  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
sent  V01
it  <ARG1
by  
the  
hand  <ARGM-MNR
of  
the  
servant  
,  
Jose  
.  

How  >ARGM-MNR
they  >ARG0
murdered  V01
him  <ARG1
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
,  
save  
that  
it  
was  V01
Murillo  
's  
hand  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
struck  V08
him  <ARG1
down  <C-V
,  
for  
Lopez  >>>ARG0
had  V01
remained  V01
to  
guard  V01
me  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
believe  V01
he  >>>ARG0
must  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
waited  V01
among  
the  
gorse  
bushes  >ARG2
through  
which  >R-ARG2
the  
path  >ARG1
winds  V01
and  
struck  V08
him  <ARG1
down  <C-V
as  
he  >ARG1
passed  V03
.  

At  
first  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG1
were  V01
of  
a  
mind  <ARG2
to  
let  V01
him  >ARG0
enter  V01
the  
house  <ARG1
and  
to  
kill  V01
him  <ARG1
as  
a  
detected  
burglar  <ARGM-PRD
;  
but  
they  >ARG0
argued  V01
that  
if  
they  >>ARG1
were  V03
mixed  V02
up  
in  
an  
inquiry  V01
their  
own  
identity  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
at  
once  >>ARGM-TMP
be  V03
publicly  >ARGM-MNR
disclosed  V01
and  
they  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
open  V08
to  
further  >ARGM-ADJ
attacks  V01
.  

With  
the  
death  V01
of  
Garcia  <ARG1
,  
the  
pursuit  V01
might  >ARGM-MOD
cease  V01
,  
since  
such  
a  
death  V01
might  >ARGM-MOD
frighten  V01
others  <ARG1
from  
the  
task  V01
.

From  
then  >ARGM-TMP

as

as  
his  >>ARG0
entering  V01
the  
world  <ARG1
of  
black  
magic  
,  
as  
deeply  <ARGM-EXT

to

in  
that

had  V04
a  
room  >>>ARGM-LOC
upholstered  V01
with  
black  
silk  <ARG2
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
he  >>ARG0
used  V03
to  
do  V02
his  >ARG0

magic  >ARG1
operations  V01
.  

Came  V03
the  
disintegration  V01
of  
the  
Beatles  
'  
minds  <ARG1
with  
LSD  >>ARG0
which  >>R-ARG0
has  V01
caused  V01

among  
others  <ARGM-ADV

schizophrenic  
lyrics  <ARG1
such  
as  
"  
I  >ARG1

when  >ARGM-TMP
the

Antichrist  
John  >>ARG0

the

strategy  <ARG1

such  
as

Antichrist  
John  >>ARG0
Lennon  
wanted  V01
to  
compete  V01
with  
Jesus  <ARG1

,  
and  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
he  >>>ARG0
grew  V01
a  
beard  <ARG1

started  V01
to

visited  V01
by  
the  
Canadian  
journalist  >>>ARG0

admonished  V02

"  
,  
The  
CURSE  V01
OF  
GOD  <ARG0
upon  
John  <ARG2

carried  V02
on  
with  
all  
type  <ARGM-MNR
of  
miseries

distresses  
which  >ARG0
made  V02

The  
CURSE  V02

carried  V02
on  
until  
he  >>ARG1
was  V03
shot  V02
dead  <ARGM-PRD

It  
is  V01
interesting  V01
to  
notice  V01
that  
he  >>ARG1

shot  V02
seven  
times  <ARGM-ADV

out  
with

,  
he  >ARG0
used  V01
Linda  >ARG1
's  
death  V01
for  
promotional  
ends  <<ARG2
,  
due  
to  
his  
waning  V01
popularity  <ARG1

Paul  >>ARG0
was  V03
going  V34
out  
with  
Heather  <ARG1
,  
but  
in  
front  >ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
audience  
he  >>>ARG0
played  V02
the  
faithful  
husband  
's  
masquerade  <ARG1
pretending  V01
to  
suffer  V01
for  
Linda  <ARG1
,  
for  
the  
afore  
mentioned  
promotional  
ends  <<<ARGM-PRP
.  

Paul  >ARG0
admitted  V01
that  
he  >ARG0
made  V02
Linda  >ARG0
suffer  V01
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT
,  
but  
he  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
say  V01
that  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
because  
he  >>ARG1
felt  V01
insecure  V01
as  
a  
man  <ARG2
due  
to  
his  
womanish  
face  <ARGM-CAU
and  
effeminate  
manners  
and  
also  
because  
with  
his  
age  >>ARGM-ADV
his  
sexual  
power  >>ARG1
was  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
the  
same  V01
,  
even  
though  
it  >>ARG1
has  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
been  V01
much  <ARG2
.  

The  
early  
days  >ARG1
were  V01
the  
days  <ARG2
of  
competition  V01
between  
Paul  <ARG0
and  
his  
wife  
and  
John  
and  
his  
wife  
and  
he  >ARG0
knew  V01
he  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
compete  V01
with  
ugly  
John  <ARG1
for  
the  
leadership  V02
of  
the  
band  <ARG1
in  
front  <<ARGM-LOC
of  
their  
wives  
and  
having  V03
Yoko  <ARG1
Ono  
made  V02
him  >ARG0
aware  V01
of  
his  
lack  V01
of  
virility  <ARG1
and  
repressed  
homosexuality  
,  
he  >>>ARG0
grew  V01
the  
beard  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
we  >ARG0
see  V01
in  
the  
"  
Let  V01
it  >ARG1
Be  V01
"  
film  <<<ARGM-LOC
and  
started  V01
to  
show  V01
pictures  <ARG1
of  
naked  
women  
in  
the  
same  
film  <ARGM-LOC
,  
doing  VLV
every  
effort  V01
he  
could  <ARG0
to  
be  V03
seen  V01
as  
a  
man  <ARG2
....  

It  
is  V01
easy  V05
to  
note  V02
the  
uneasiness  >ARGM-TMP
of  
McCartney  
when  >R-ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
sings  V01
:  
"  
I  >>>ARG0
've  V01
got  VLV
a  
feeling  V01
,  
a  
feeling  V01
I  >ARG0

...  
"  
in  
front  <<<ARGM-LOC
of  
Yoko  
in  
the  
film  <<<ARGM-LOC
.  

(  
He  >>ARG1
already  >>ARGM-TMP
had  VLV
the  
traumas  V01
that  >>R-ARG1
his  
previous  
girlfriend  >>ARG0
Jane  
Asher  
had  V01
caused  V01
him  <ARGM-GOL
when  >ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG0
made  V02
him  >ARG0
aware  V01
of  
his  
little  
manliness  <ARG1
and  
effeminate  
manners  
)  
.  

Paul  >ARG0
has  V03
such  
a  
big  
inferiority  
complex  <ARG1
as  
a  
man  
,  
due  
to  
his  
effeminate  
face  
,  
body  
and  
personality  
and  
due  
to  
his  
repressed  
homosexuality  
,  
that  
he  >>>ARG0
found  V01
himself  <ARG2
a  
handicapped  
woman  <ARG1
with  
only  
one  
leg  
,  
so  
that  
he  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
stand  V06
out  
,  
being  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
conscious  V01
that  
a  
full  
woman  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
make  V02
him  >ARG0
feel  V01
the  
superiority  <ARG1
of  
virile  
men  
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
as  
Jane  
and  
Linda  
did  V01
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
something  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
his  >ARG0
ego  >ARG0
trip  V03
of  
lucky  
bad  
musician  <ARGM-ADJ
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
face  V01
anymore  <ARGM-TMP
....  

He  >>ARG0
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
conscious  V01
that  
money  >ARGM-MNR
and  
fame  
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
buy  V01
virility  <ARG1
and  
manliness  
.  

Besides  
being  V01
a  
murderer  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
John  >>>ARG0
Lennon  
had  VLV
sexual  >ARGM-MNR
intercourse  V01
with  
homosexual  
Brian  <ARG1
Epstein  
to  
get  V04
him  >ARG1
interested  V01
in  
going  V04
to  
see  V01
the  
band  <ARG1
at  
the  
Cavern  <ARGM-LOC
,  
trauma  >ARG2
from  
which  >R-ARG2
he  >ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
recovered  V01
.  

Because  
of  
the  
trauma  >>>ARGM-CAU
that  >>>R-ARG1
his  >ARG0
homosexual  >ARG1
relation  V03
with  
Brian  <ARG2
Epstein  
had  V01
left  V02
him  <ARG2
,  
he  >>>ARG0
made  V01
lyrics  <ARG1
such  
as  
:  
"  
You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
wear  V01
a  
collar  <ARG1
and  
a  
tie  
,  
one  
thing  >>ARG1
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hide  V01
is  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
're  V01
crippled  <ARG2
inside  <ARGM-LOC
"  
and  
gave  VLV
declarations  V01
to  
the  
"  
Rolling  
Stone  
"  
magazine  <ARG2
saying  V01
that  
"  
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
wore  V01
Texan  
boots  <ARG1
to  
feel  V01
more  
secure  <ARG1
as  
a  
man  
"  
.  

The  
Beatles  >>ARG1
are  V03
very  
well  >ARGM-EXT
known  V02
by  
people  <ARG0
close  
to  
them  
for  
their  
arrogance  <ARGM-PRP
and  
racism  
.  

One  >>ARG1
of  
the  
manifestations  V01
of  
their  
racism  <ARG1
is  V01
the  
rejection  <ARG2
towards  
Japanese  
Yoko  
Ono  
.  

That  
rejection  >ARG1
got  V05
to  
the  
point  >ARGM-ADV
that  >R-ARGM-ADV
George  >ARG0
Harrison  
kicked  V01
Yoko  <ARG1
Ono  
in  
the  
Apple  
studios  <ARGM-LOC
during  
the  
filming  V01
of  
Let  V01
it  >ARG1
Be  V01
.  

When  >>>ARGM-TMP
John  >ARG0
asked  V01
George  <ARG2
while  
they  >>>ARG0
were  V03
having  VLV
lunch  V01
about  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
things  >>ARG1
were  V03
going  V06
for  
Paul  <ARGM-GOL
after  
his  >ARG1
separation  V01
from  
the  
Beatles  <ARG2
and  
George  >ARG0
replied  V01
that  
he  >ARG1
was  V01
number  <ARG2
one  
in  
the  
Swedish  >ARGM-LOC
hit  >ARG0
parade  V01
,  
John  >ARG0
said  V01
in  
a  
despective  
manner  <ARGM-MNR
:  
"  
ah  <ARG1
!!  
..  
in  
Sweden  
..  
"  
,  
as  
if  
Sweden  >ARG1
was  V01
an  
inferior  
place  <ARG2
or  
something  
alike  
.  

In  
the  
Beatles  
'  
song  >>ARGM-LOC
"  
Get  V05
Back  <ARG2
"  
they  >ARG0
advise  V01
black  
Joe  >ARG1
to  
"  
get  V05
back  <ARG2
to  
where  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
once  >ARGM-TMP
belonged  V01
"  
,  
as  
if  
England  >ARG1
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
place  <ARG2
for  
black  
people  
.  

Sometimes  
back  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Paul  >ARG0
told  V01
George  <ARG2
in  
the  
Apple  
offices  <ARGM-LOC
that  
the  
new  
generations  >ARG1
are  V01
a  
bundle  <ARG2
of  
idiots  
and  
useless  
people  
,  
but  
in  
any  
way  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
also  >ARGM-ADV
been  V01
slaves  <ARG2
of  
the  
Beatles  
.  

The  
Jewish  >ARGM-ADJ
marriage  V01
living  V01
to  
the  
right  <ARGM-LOC
of  
George  
's  
house  
said  V01
that  
he  >ARG1
is  V01
an  
arrogant  
person  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
does  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
return  V02
a  
greeting  V01
.  

The  
newly  
married  
couple  >>ARG0
living  V01
on  
the  
corner  <ARGM-LOC
in  
front  
of  
the  
entrance  
of  
George  
's  
house  
(  
Friar  
Park  
)  
refers  V01
to  
him  <ARG1
as  
an  
overbearing  
person  <ARG2
to  
stay  V01
away  <ARG3
from  
.  

The  
receptionist  >>ARG0
of  
"  
Hand  
made  
"  
,  
the  
former  
film  >ARG1
making  V01
company  
of  
George  
Harrison  
said  V01
:  
"  
we  
do  V01
n't  
have  VLV
any  
relation  V03
with  
that  
man  <ARG2
anymore  
and  
we  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
know  V01
anything  <ARG1
about  
him  
"  
.  

It  
is  V01
interesting  V01
to  
note  V01
that  
this  
company  >>ARG1
was  V03
made  V02
bankrupt  <C-ARG1
by  
the  
British  
cinema  
industry  <ARG0
due  
to  
the  
despotism  <ARGM-CAU
and  
pedantry  
of  
George  >ARG0
Harrison  
,  
who  >R-ARG0
believed  V01
that  
the  
cinema  
industry  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
worshiped  V01
him  <ARG1
.  

Their  
chauvinisms  >ARG1
got  V05
to  
the  
point  >ARGM-ADV
that  >R-ARGM-ADV
even  
they  >ARG0
themselves  
hated  V01
each  
other  <ARG1
.  

Paul  >ARG0
McCartney  
said  V01
that  
George  >ARG1
Harrison  
is  V01
a  
nothing  <ARG2
.  

George  >ARG0
Harrison  
said  V01
that  
he  >>ARG0
is  V01
tired  V03
of  
listening  V01
to  
people  >ARG0
talk  V01
about  
John  <ARG1
Lennon  
....  

George  >ARG0
Harrison  
said  V01
in  
a  
video  <ARGM-LOC
that  
"  
Oasis  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
very  
untalented  
band  <ARG2
and  
they  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
playing  V11
at  
all  <ARGM-ADV
"  
,  
all  >ARG1
of  
it  
being  V01
the  
truth  <ARG2
,  
but  
the  
Beatles  >ARG1
is  V01
also  <ARGM-ADV
a  
band  <ARG2
of  
very  
poor  
musicians  >>ARG1
,  
if  
musicians  
at  
all  
,  
who  >R-ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
play  V11
a  
couple  <ARG1
of  
elementary  
guitar  
chords  
and  
who  >R-ARG1
are  V01
as  
untalented  <ARG2
as  
Oasis  
.  

The  
Beatles  >ARG1
of  
the  
times  
of  
the  
"  
Cavern  
"  
sounded  V01
exactly  
as  
poorly  <ARG2
as  
Oasis  
and  
the  
little  
musical  
quality  >ARG1
in  
the  
songs  
of  
the  
Beatles  
is  V01
due  
to  
George  <ARG2
Martin  
.  

Without  
George  >>ARGM-ADV
Martin  
the  
Beatles  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V01
just  
another  
untalented  
band  <ARG2
as  
Oasis  <ARGM-MNR
....  

Paul  >ARG0
McCartney  
said  V01
recently  <ARGM-TMP
that  
he  >ARG0
believes  V01
in  
using  V01
magic  <ARG1
,  
and  
he  >>ARG0
does  V02
lots  <ARG1
of  
charity  
,  
thinking  V01
that  
in  
this  
way  >ARGM-MNR
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
compensate  V01
for  
the  
CURSE  V02
OF  
GOD  <ARG0
that  >R-ARG1
is  V01
upon  
him  <ARG2
and  
that  >R-ARG0
took  V01
his  
wife  
's  
life  <ARG1
because  
of  
his  
Satanism  <ARGM-CAU
and  
involvement  V01
in  
black  
magic  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
thinks  V01
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
deceive  V01
people  <ARG1
in  
this  
way  <ARGM-MNR
,  
so  
that  
the  
real  
McCartney  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
perceived  V01
.  

Is  V01
the  
old  
Devil  >>ARG0
attempting  V01
to  
disguise  V01
as  
good  <ARG2
in  
front  <ARGM-LOC
of  
people  
.  

Satan  >ARG0
deceiving  V01
mankind  <ARG1
once  
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
as  
so  
many  
other  
thousands  <ARGM-ADV
of  
times  
through  
the  
centuries  
....  

After  
the  
Devil  >ARG0
began  V01
his  
devastating  
job  <ARG1
from  
the  
ghostly  
"  
Devil

"  
through  
his  
nine  
main  
puppets  <ARG2
(  
Beatles  
-  
Rolling

)  
,  
he  >ARG0
possessed  V01
an  
endless  
amount  <ARG1
of  
other  
schizophrenic  
bad  
musician  
in  
the  
afore  
mentioned  
Island  
and  
weakening  V01
their  
conscience  <ARG1
with  
drugs  <ARGM-MNR
,  
he  >ARG0
made  V02
them  <ARG1
proclaimers  <ARG1
of  
homosexuality

aversion  V01

destruction  V01

The  
fact  >>>ARG1
that  
bad  
apprentice  
musicians  >ARG0
such  
as  
the  
Beatles

the

that  >R-ARG1
not  
even  
the  
real  
quality  
musicians  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
achieve  V01
,  
was  V01
because  
the  
forces  >>ARG0

were  V01
behind  
everything  <ARG2

supporting  V01
the

An  
examination  V01
of  
the  
ramifications  V02
of  
such  
an  
attack  V01
is  V01
desperately  <ARGM-MNR
in  
order  V01
.  

1  
.  
Blowback  
in  
Iraq  

The  
recent  >ARGM-TMP
elections  V01
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
were  V03
dominated  V01
by  
an  
amalgam  <ARG0
of  
religiously  
fundamentalist  
Shi'ite  
organizations  
,  
principally  
the  
Dawa  
Party  
and  
the  
Supreme  
Council  
for  
Islamic  
Revolution  
in  
Iraq  
(  
SCIRI  
)  
.  

Both  
Dawa  >ARG0
and  
SCIRI  
have  V03
umbilical  >ARG3
connections  V01
to  
the  
fundamentalist  
Shi'ite  >ARGM-ADJ
leadership  V02
in  
Iran  <ARGM-LOC
that  >R-ARG1
go  V01
back  <ARGM-PRD
decades  <ARG4
.  

In  
essence  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Iran  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
owns  V01
a  
significant  
portion  <ARG1
of  
the  
Iraqi  
government  
.  

Should  >ARGM-MOD
the  
United  
States  >ARG0
undertake  V01
military  >ARG0
action  V02
against  
Iran  <ARGM-GOL
,  
the  
ramifications  V02
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
immediate  <ARG2
and  
extreme  V01
.  

In  
the  
first  
eight  
days  >>>ARGM-TMP
of  
January  
,  
eighteen  
US  
troops  >>>ARG1
have  V01
been  V03
killed  V01
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
,  
compounded  V01
by  
another  
twelve  
deaths  V01
from  
a  
Black  
Hawk  
helicopter  >ARG1
crash  V01
on  
Saturday  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Much  >>>ARG1
of  
the  
violence  >ARG1
aimed  V02
at  
American  
forces  <ARG2
is  V03
coming  V03
from  
disgruntled  
Sunni  
factions  >>>ARG0
that  >>>R-ARG0
have  V03
their  
own  
militias  <ARG1
,  
believe  V01
the  
last  >ARGM-TMP
elections  V01
were  V01
a  
sham  <ARG2
,  
and  
hold  V03
little  
political  
power  <ARG1
in  
the  
government  <ARGM-ADV
.  

If  
the  
US  >ARG0
attacks  V01
Iran  <ARG1
,  
it  
is  V01
probable  <ARG2
that  
American  
forces  >>>ARG0
-  
already  >ARGM-TMP
taxed  V01
by  
attacks  V01
from  
Sunni  
factions  <ARG0
-  
will  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-ADV
face  V01
reprisal  >ARGM-CAU
attacks  V01
in  
Iraq  <<ARGM-LOC
from  
Shi'ite  
factions  <ARG0
loyal  
to  
Iran  
.  

The  
result  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
dramatic  >ARGM-EXT
escalation  V01
in  
US  
and  
civilian  
casualties  <ARG1
,  
US  
forces  >>>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
required  V01
to  
bunker  V01
themselves  <ARG1
further  
into  
their  
bases  <ARG2
,  
and  
US  
forces  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
find  V01
themselves  >>ARG0
required  V01
to  
fight  V01
the  
very  
government  >>ARG2
they  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
finished  V01
helping  V01
into  
power  <ARG1
.  

Iraq  >>ARG1
,  
already  
a  
seething  V01
cauldron  <ARG1
,  
will  >ARGM-MOD
sink  V01
further  <ARG2
into  
chaos  <ARG4
.  

2  
.  
Iran  
's  
Armaments  

Unlike  
Iraq  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
Iran  >>>ARG0
has  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
spent  V02
the  
last  
fifteen  
years  <ARG1
having  V04
its  
conventional  
forces  >ARG1
worn  V05
down  
by  
grueling  
sanctions  <ARG0
,  
repeated  >ARGM-PRD
attacks  V01
,  
and  
two  
American  
-  
led  >ARG0
wars  V01
.  

While  
Iran  
's  
conventional  
army  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
what  >>>ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
was  V01
during  
the  
heyday  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
Iran  
-  
Iraq  >ARG0
war  V01
-  
their  
armaments  >>ARG1
have  V01
deteriorated  V01
and  
the  
veterans  >>>ARG0
of  
that  
last  >ARGM-TMP
war  V01
have  V01
retired  V01
-  
the  
nation  >ARG0
enjoys  V01
substantial  
military  
strength  <ARG1
nonetheless  <ARGM-ADV
.  

According  
to  
a  
report  V01
issued  V01
by  
the  
Center  <ARG0
for  
Strategic  
and  
International  
Studies  
in  
December  <ARGM-TMP
of  
2004  
,  
Iran  >ARG0
"  
has  V03
some  
540,000  
men  <ARG1
under  
arms  
and  
over  
350,000  
reserves  
.  

They  >ARG2
include  V01
120,000  
Iranian  
Revolutionary  
Guards  >ARG2
trained  V01
for  
land  
and  
naval  
asymmetrical  
warfare  <ARG1
.  

Iran  
's  
military  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-DIS
includes  V01
holdings  V01
of  
1,613  
main  
battle  
tanks  <ARG1
,  
21,600  
other

and  
10

"  
Iran  >ARG1
is  V01
now  <ARGM-TMP
the  
only  
regional  
military  
power  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG0
poses  V02
a  
significant  
conventional  
military  
threat  <ARG1
to  
Gulf  
stability  
,  
"  
continued  V02
the  
CSIS  >ARG0
report  V01

"  
Iran  >>ARG0
has  V03
significant  
capabilities  <ARG1
for  
asymmetric  
warfare  
,  
and  
poses  V02
the  
additional  
threat  <ARG1
of  
proliferation  V01
.  

There  
is  V02
considerable  
evidence  <ARG1
that  
it  >>ARG0
is  V03
developing  V02
both  
a  
long  
-  
range  
missile  
force  <ARG1
and  
a  
range  
of  
weapons  
of  
mass  >ARGM-ADJ
destruction  V01
.  

It  >>ARG0
has  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
properly  >ARGM-ADV
declared  V01
its  >ARG0
holdings  V01
of  
chemical  
weapons  <ARG1
,  
and  
the  
status  >>ARG1
of  
its  
biological  
weapons  
programs

unknown  V01
.  
"  

A  
MILNET  
brief  >>ARG0
issued  V01
in  
February  <ARGM-TMP
2005  
reports  V01
,  
"  
Due  
to  
its  
position  >>ARGM-CAU
astride  
the  
Persian  
Gulf  
,  
Iran  >>ARG1
has  V01
constantly  >ARGM-TMP
been  V01
a  
threat  <ARG2
to  
the  
Gulf  
.  

The  
so  
called  >ARGM-ADJ
'  
Tanker  
'  
wars  V01
in  
the  
late  
1980s  <ARGM-TMP

Iran  <ARG1
squarely  
in  
the  
bullseye  <ARG2
of  
all  
nations  >ARG0
seeking  V01
to  
transport  V01
oil  <ARG1
out  
of  
the  
region  <ARG2
.  

Even  
the  
small  
navy  >>>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
Iran  >ARG0
puts  V01
to  
sea  <ARG2
is  V01
capable  V01
enough  <ARGM-CXN

harass  V02
shipping  V01

and  
several  >ARGM-ADJ

the  
Gulf  <ARGM-LOC

that  
period  <ARGM-TMP

it  <ARG1
clear  V06
small  
asymmetrical  
tactics  >>ARG0
of  
the  
Iranian  
Navy  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
quite  >ARGM-EXT
effective  V04

"  

"  
More  
concerning  >>ARG2
,  
"  
continued  V02
the  
MILNET  
brief  <ARG0
,  <C-ARG1-DSP
"  <C-ARG1-DSP
is  V01
the  
priority  >ARG1
placed  V01
on  
expanding  V01
and  
modernizing  V01
its  
Navy  <ARG1
.  <<<C-ARG1-DSP

The  
CSIS  >ARG0
report  V01
cites  V01
numerous  
areas  >>ARGM-LOC
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
Iran  >>ARG0
has  V01
funded  V01
modernization  V01
including  
the  
most  
troublesome  
aspect  
,  
anti-shipping  
cruise  
missiles  
:  
'  
Iran  >>ARG0
has  V01
obtained  V01
new  
anti-ship  
missiles  <ARG1
and

from  
China  
,  
midget  
submarines  
from  
North  
Korea  
,  
submarines  
from  
Russia  
,  
and  
modern  
mines  
.  
'  
"  

It  
is  V01
Iran  
's  
missile  
armaments  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
pose  V02
the  
greatest  >ARGM-ADJ
concern  V01
for  
American  
forces  <ARG1
in  
the  
Gulf  
,  
especially  
for  
the  
US  
Navy  
.  

Iran  
's  
coast  >>ARG1
facing  V01
the  
Persian  
Gulf  <ARG1
is  V01
a  
looming  V01
wall  <ARG1
of  
mountains  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
look  V10
down  
upon  
any  
naval  
forces  >ARG1
arrayed  V01
in  
those  
waters  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
Gulf  >ARG0
itself  
only  >ARGM-ADV
has  V03
one  
exit  <ARG1
,  
the  
Strait  >>ARG1
of  
Hormuz  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V03
also  >ARGM-DIS
dominated  V01
by  
the  
mountainous  
Iranian  
coastline  <ARG0
.  

In  
essence  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Iran  >ARG0
holds  V01
the  
high  
ground  <ARG1
in  
the  
Gulf  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Missile  
batteries  >>ARG0
arrayed  V01
in  
those  
mountains  <ARGM-LOC
could  >ARGM-MOD
raise  V01
bloody  
havoc  <ARG1
with  
any  
fleet  >ARG1
deployed  V01
below  <ARG2
.  

Of  
all  
the  
missiles  
in  
Iran  
's  
armament  
,  
the  
most  
dangerous  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
Russian  
-  
made  
SS  
-  
N  
-  
22  
Sunburn  <ARG2
.  

These  
missiles  >ARG1
are  V01
,  
simply  <ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
fastest  
anti-ship  
weapons  <ARG2
on  
the  
planet  
.  

The  
Sunburn  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
reach  V01
Mach  <ARG1
3  
at  
high  
altitude  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Its  
maximum  
low  
-  
altitude  
speed  >ARG1
is  V01
Mach  <ARG2
2.2  
,  
some  
three  
times  
faster  
than  
the  
American  
-  
made  
Harpoon  
.  

The  
Sunburn  >>ARG0
takes  V10
two  
short  
minutes  <ARG1
to  
cover  V01
its  
full  
range  <ARG1
.  

The  
missile  
's  
manufacturers  >ARG0
state  V01
that  
one  
or  
two  
missiles  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
cripple  V01
a  
destroyer  <ARG1
,  
and  
five  
missiles  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
sink  V01
a  
20,000  
ton  
ship  <ARG1
.  

The  
Sunburn  >>ARG1
is  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
superior  V01
to  
the  
Exocet  
missile  <ARG2
.  

Recall  V02
that  
it  
was  V01
two  
Exocets  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
ripped  V01
the  
USS  
Stark  <ARG1
to  
shreds  <ARGM-GOL
in  
1987  <ARGM-TMP
,  
killing  V01
37  
sailors  <ARG1
.  

The  
Stark  >>ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
see  V01
them  <ARG1
to  
stop  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

The  
US  
aircraft  
carrier  >>ARG1
Theodore  
Roosevelt  
is  V03
currently  >ARGM-TMP
deployed  V01
in  
the  
Persian  
Gulf  <ARG2

with  
some  
7,000  
souls  <ARGM-ADV
aboard

Sailing  V01
with  
the  
Roosevelt  <ARGM-COM

the  
Tarawa  
Expeditionary  
Strike  
Force  >ARG2

which  >R-ARG2

the  
USS  
Tarawa  <ARG1
,  
the  
USS  
Austin  
,  
and  
the  
USS  
Pearl  
Harbor  
.  

The  
USS  
Austin  >>ARG1
is  V03
likewise  >ARGM-DIS
deployed  V01
in  
the  
Gulf  <ARG2

The  
Sunburn  
missile  >>>ARG0
,  
with  
its  
incredible  
speed  >>>ARGM-ADV
and  
ability  
to  
avoid  V01
radar  >ARG0
detection  V01
,  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
do  VLV
terrible  >ARGM-ADJ
damage  V01
these  
ships  <ARG1
if  
Iran  >>ARG0
chooses  V01
to  
retaliate  V01
in  
the  
Gulf  <ARGM-LOC
after  
an  
American  >ARG0
attack  V01
within  
its  
borders  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Beyond  
the  
naval  
threat  >ARG2
is  V01
the  
possibility  <ARG1
of  
Iran  >ARG0
throwing  V01
its  
military  
muscle  <ARG1
into  
the  
ongoing  >ARGM-TMP
struggle  V01
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Currently  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
US  >>ARG0
is  V03
facing  V01
an  
asymmetrical  >ARGM-ADJ
attack  V01
from  
groups  >ARG0
wielding  V01
small  
arms  <ARG1
,  
shoulder  
-  
fired  
grenades  
and  
roadside  
bombs  
.  

The  
vaunted  
American  
military  >>ARG0
has  V01
suffered  V01
2,210  
deaths  V01
and  
tens  
of  
thousands  
of  
wounded  
from  
this  
form  <<ARGM-CAU
of  
warfare  
.  

The  
occupation  V01
of  
Iraq  <ARG1
has  V01
become  V01
a  
guerrilla  >ARGM-MNR
war  V01
,  
a  
siege  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1

lasted  V01
more  
than  
a  
thousand  
days  <ARG2

If

throw  V01
any  <ARG1

23,000

the

The  
Syrian  >ARG2
Connection  V01

In  
February  >ARGM-TMP
of  
2005  
,  
Iran  >ARG0
and  
Syria  
agreed  V01
upon  
a  
mutual  >ARGM-ADJ
protection  V01
pact  >ARGM-ADV
to  
combat  V01
"  
challenges  V01
and  
threats  
"  
in  
the  
region  <ARGM-LOC
.  

This  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
specific  >ARGM-ADJ
reaction  V01
to  
the  
American  >ARG0
invasion  V01
of  
Iraq  <ARG1
,  
and  
a  
reaction  V01
to  
America  >ARG0
's  
condemnation  V01
of  
Syria  <ARG1
after  
the  
death  V01
of  
Lebanese  
Prime  
Minister  <ARG1
Rafik  
Hariri  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
was  V03
widely  >ARGM-ADV
seen  V01
as  
an  
assassination  V01
ordered  V01
from  
Damascus  <ARG0
.  

An  
attack  V01
on  
Iran  <ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
trigger  V01
this  
mutual  >ARGM-ADJ
defense  V01
pact  <<ARG1
,  
and  
could  >ARGM-MOD
conceivably  >ARGM-ADV
bring  V01
Syria  <ARG1
into  
direct  >ARGM-ADJ
conflict  V01
with  
American  
forces  <ARG1
.  

Like  
Iran  >ARGM-PRD
,  
Syria  
's  
military  >>ARG0
is  V01
nothing  >ARG1
to  
scoff  V01
at  <C-ARG1
.  

Virtually  >ARGM-ADJ
every  
credible  >ARGM-ADJ
analysis  V01
has  V04
Syria  >ARG1
standing  V04
as  
the  
strongest  
military  
force  <ARG2
in  
the  
Middle  
East  
after  
Israel  
.  

Damascus  >>ARG1
has  V01
been  V01
intent  <ARG2
for  
years  <ARGM-TMP
upon  
establishing  V01
significant  
military  
strength  >ARGM-ADV
to  
serve  V01
as  
a  
counterweight  <ARG1
to  
Israel  
's  
overwhelming  
capabilities  
.  

As  
of  
2002  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Syria  >ARG0
had  V03
some  
215,000  
soldiers  <ARG1
under  
arms  
,  
4,700  
tanks  
,  
and  
a  
massive  
artillery  
capability  
.  

The  
Syrian  
Air  
Force  >>ARG1
is  V03
comprised  V01
of  
ten  
to  
eleven  
fighter  
/  
attack  V01
squadrons  >ARG1
and  
sixteen  
fighter  
squadrons  
,  
totaling  V01
somewhere  
near  
650  
aircraft  <ARG2
.  

Syria  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
possesses  V01
one  >ARG1
of  
the  
largest  
arsenals  
of  
ballistic  
missiles  
in  
the  
region  
,  
comprised  V01
primarily  <ARGM-ADV
of  
SCUD  >ARG2
-  
derived  V01
systems  <ARG1
.  

Iran  >>ARG1
,  
North  
Korea  
and  
China  
have  V01
been  V01
willing  
providers  <ARG2
of  
state  
-  
of  
-  
the  
-  
art  
technologies  
.  

Compounding  V01
this  <ARG1
is  V03
the  
well  >ARGM-ADJ
-  
based  V02
suspicion  V01
that  
Syria  >ARG0
has  V03
perhaps  
the  
most  
advanced  
chemical  
weapons  
capability  <ARG1
in  
the  
Persian

China  >>ARG0
has  V01
inked  V01
deals  V01
with

for  
$  
70  
billion  
dollars  
worth  <ARG3
of  
Iranian  
oil  
and

China  >>>ARG0

250

receive  V01
150,000  
barrels  <ARG1
of  
oil  
per  
day  <ARGM-TMP
from  
that  
field  <ARG2

China  >>ARG0
is  V03
seeking  V01

construction  V01
of  
a

from  
Iran  
to  
the

link  V01
with  
another

from

to  
China  <ARG4

Any

could  >>ARGM-MOD

perceived  V01
by

Further  >>ARGM-DIS

any

the  
US  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
faced  V01
with  
a  
significant

This

The  
question  V01

a  
path  <ARG1

fraught

peril

potential  
economic  
catastrophe  
?  

It  
is  V01
difficult  V01
to  
imagine  V01
a  
justification  V01
for  
any  
action  V02
that  >R-ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD

working  V01

The

marvelous  
political  
cover  <ARG1

during

What  
kind  >>ARG1

would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
gained  V02
from  
an  
attack  V01

and  
from  
the  
diversion  V01
of  
attention  V02
to  
that

The  
answer  V01
lies  V07
in  
one  
now

familiar  
name  <ARG2

Jack

be  V03
banned  V01
entering  V01
the  
country  <ARG1
to  
plant  V01
their  
eggs  <ARG1
,  
as  
they  >>ARG1
are  V03
considered  V01
as  
the  
rotten  
left  
overs  <ARGM-PRD
of  
dinasaurs  

Being  V01
the  
texting  
capital  <ARG2
of  
the  
world  
.  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
recommend  V01
living  V01
in  
Limerick  <ARGM-LOC
as  
a  
student  <ARGM-PRD
?  

I  >>>ARG2
've  V01
been  V03
given  V01
the  
opportunity  <ARG1
to  
live  V01
in  
Limerick  <ARGM-LOC
,  
Ireland  
,  
next  
year  <ARGM-TMP
as  
part  <ARGM-ADV
of  
my  
course  
..  
if  
you  >ARG0
know  V01
about  
Limerick  <ARG1
,  
what  >ARG2
are  V01
the  
pros  <ARG1
and  
cons  
?  

and  >ARGM-DIS
would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
recommend  V01
it  <ARG1
as  
a  
student  <ARG3
?  

The  
L.I.T  >>ARG1
is  V01
so  >ARGM-EXT
close  V10
to  
Moyross  <ARG2
,  
yet  
again  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
ppl  >>ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
talk  V01
sh*t  <ARG1
about  
Moyross  <ARGM-PRD
still  >ARGM-TMP
go  V02
there  <ARG4
.  

Limerick  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
great  
student  
city  <ARG2
,  
there  
's  V02
loads  <ARG1
on  
,  
you  >>ARG1
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
spoilt  V01
for  
choice  V01
.  

In  
fact  >ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >>ARG0
probably  >ARGM-ADV
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
ever  >ARGM-TMP
want  V01
to  
leave  V11
.  

Orla  >ARG0
got  V01
it  <ARG1
in  
one  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Although  
there  
is  V02
'  
bad  
press  >ARG1
'  
directing  V01
at  
AREA'S  <ARG2
of  
limerick  
,  
but  
nowhere  
near  
the  
university  
.  

Limerick  >ARG1
is  V01
such  
a  
full  
city  <ARG2
,  
shopping  V01
,  
night  
life  
,  
career  >ARG1
choices  V01
,  
social  >ARGM-ADJ
choices  V01
,  
I  >ARG1
came  V01
here  <ARG4
about  
12  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
for  
college  <ARGM-PRP
.....  
and  
Orla  >ARG0
got  V01
it  <ARG1
spot  
on  <ARG1
,  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
left  V11
,  
nor  
would  
I  
.  

It  >ARG1
s  V01
now  <ARGM-TMP
my  
home  <ARG2
.  

My  
myTouch  
4G  >ARG1
crashes  V01
with  
most  
custom  
ROMs  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
install  V01
.  

Can  >>ARGM-MOD
that  >>ARG1
be  V03
fixed  V02
?  

I  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-EXT
like  V01
the  
MIUI  <ARG1
,  
but  
a  
process  V02
crashes  V01
repeatedly  <ARGM-MNR
about  
every  
3  
seconds  <ARGM-TMP
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
load  V01
the  
newest  
version  <ARG2
of  
Cyanogen  
Mod  
.  

not  
by  
the  
company  
...  
as  
you  >ARG0
voided  V01
your  
warrenty  <ARG1
by  
installing  V01
custom  
roms  <ARG1

you  >>>ARG0
are  V01
best  V02
to  
either  
recover  V02
to  
the  
standard  
ROM  <ARG1
,  
or  
find  V01
one  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
crash  V01
.  

cynangon  
mod  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
work  V09
.  

Have  V01
you  >>ARG0
tried  V01
using  V01
clockwork  >ARGM-MNR
recovery  V02
?  

Get  V01
the  
older  
version  <ARG1
of  
Cynagon  
mod  
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
use  V01
a  
stable  
rom  <ARG1
like  
bugless  
beast  
and  
baked  
snake  
.  

Those  
roms  >ARG0
focus  V01
on  
speed  <ARG2
and  
stability  
.  

Or  >ARGM-DIS
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
use  V01
a  
home  
screen  >ARG1
launcher  >ARG1
replacement  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend  V01
go  
launcher  <ARG1
or  
adw  
launcher  
.  

They  >>>ARG0
are  V01
both  >ARGM-ADV
excellent  V02
and  
speed  V02
up  
the  
phone  <ARG1
quite  
a  
bit  <ARGM-EXT
.  

As  
a  
mytouch  
4g  
owner  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
know  V01
the  
phone  >>ARG1
is  V01
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
fast  V02
and  
their  
is  V02
no  
point  <ARG1
installing  V01
a  
rom  <ARG1
.  

Hope  V01
you  >ARG0
read  V01
through  
this  <ARG1

are  V01
the  
moors  <ARG1
and  
penines  
in  
Yorkshire  
a  
lonely  
eerie  
place  <ARG2
?  

and  
how  
big  >ARG2
are  V01
they  <ARG1
?  

i  >ARG1
m  V01
33  <ARG2
.  

i  >>ARG1
ve  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
been  V01
to  
the  
yorkshire  
moors  <ARG2
or  
penines  
at  
all  <ARGM-ADV
...  
i  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
the  
penines  <ARG1
in  
the  
far  
distance  <ARGM-LOC
from  
my  
bedroom  
window  <ARGM-DIR
.  

when  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
watched  V01
werewolf  <ARG1
in  
london  
(  
great  
film  
)  
that  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
only  
time  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
saw  V01
the  
yorkshire  
moors  <ARG1
.  

can  >ARGM-MOD
anyone  >ARG0
give  V01
me  <ARG2
information  <ARG1
about  
them  
?  

They  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
bleak  V01
and  
eerie  
,  
often  
very  
exposed  
,  
often  
covered  
with  
antiquities  
like  
bronze  
age  
burial  
mounds  
,  
stone  
circles  
and  
settlements  
--  
until  
late  >ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
bronze  
age  
they  >ARG1
were  V01
rich  
farmlands  <ARG2
,  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
change  V01
in  
the  
climate  <ARG1
caused  V01
the  
skies  >ARG1
to  
cloud  V01
over  <ARGM-PRD
and  
rain  >ARG2
to  
wash  V01
the  
goodness  <ARG1
from  
the  
soil  <ARG3
.  

The  
people  >ARG0
abandoned  V01
their  
farms  <ARG1
and  
religious  
sites  
and  
the  
ground  >>ARG1
they  >ARG1
stood  V01
on  <C-ARG2
became  V01
moorland  <ARG2
.  

They  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
also  >>ARGM-DIS
be  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
beautiful  V02
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
purple  
heather  >ARG1
is  V01
out  <ARG2
,  
and  
they  >ARG1
are  V01
habitat  <ARG2
to  
much  
wildlife  
and  
many  
species  
of  
wildflowers  
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
western  
pleasure  
appy  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
s  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
heavy  V01
on  
her  
left  
lead  <ARGM-LOC
at  
the  
lope  <ARGM-LOC
?  

My  
appy  >>ARG1
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
heavy  V01
on  
her  
left  
lead  <ARGM-LOC
at  
the  
lope  <ARGM-LOC
.  

She  >>>ARG0
seems  V01
to  
lope  V01
one  
stride  V01
and  
trot  V01
the  
next  <ARGM-TMP
and  
repeat  V01
...  

How  >ARGM-MNR
could  >ARGM-MOD
I  >>>ARG1
work  V01
with  
her  <ARG3
to  
get  V05
off  
her  
four  
hand  <ARG2
,  
get  V01
balance  <ARG1
,  
and  
lope  V01
smoothly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
slowly  
??  

Put  V08
on  
a  
pair  <ARG1
of  
spurs  
and  
before  
she  >>ARG0
makes  VLV
that  
trot  >ARGM-MNR
step  V01
,  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
in  
the  
feeling  V03
when  >R-ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
feel  V01
her  <ARG1
think  V01
trot  <ARG1
,  
tick  V05
her  <ARG1
with  
the  
spur  <ARGM-MNR
and  
lift  V01
with  
your  
body  >ARG0
to  
keep  V02
her  >ARG1
moving  V01
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
concentrate  V01
on  
that  
feel  <ARG1
just  
before  
the  
trot  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
figure  V05
it  <ARG1
out  <C-V
and  
the  
timing  V02
is  V01
essential  V01
to  
push  V01
her  <ARG1
at  
that  
instant  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Lope  V01
her  <ARG1
to  
the  
left  <ARGM-DIR
in  
circles  <ARG2
,  
keep  V02
her  
head  <ARG1
to  
the  
inside  <ARG2
of  
the  
circle  
and  
push  V01
her  <ARG1
but  <ARG2
out  <ARG2
,  
keep  V02
doing  V02
this  <ARG1
if  
she  >ARG0
breaks  V20
to  
a  
jog  <ARGM-PRD
go  V02
a  
little  
bit  
bigger  
circle  <ARG1
,  
till  
she  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
enough  
balance  <ARG1
to  
go  V02
small  
and

It  >>ARG1

..  
i  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
some  
dead  
pixel  <ARG1
...  
is  V02
there  
something  <ARG1
wrong  
with  
my  
camera  
body  
?  

lens  
?  

or  
what  
?  

please  >ARGM-DIS
help  V01
me  <ARG1
..  
and  
what  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
i  >>ARG0
do  V02
to  
fix  V02
this  
problem  <ARG1
?  

or  
it  >>ARG1
is  V01
normal  V02
?  

Are  V01
you  >ARG0
sure  V02
it  >ARG1
is  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
dirt  <ARG2
on  
the  
sensor  <ARGM-LOC
?  

Put  V03
the  
camera  <ARG1
on  
manual  
focus  <ARG2
and  
set  V01
focus  <ARG1
to  
infinity  <ARG2

Take  VLV
a  
photo  V01
of  
a  
very  
light  
plain  
subject  <ARG1
close  
to  
the  
lens  
using  V01
long  >ARGM-TMP
exposure  V01
and  
smallest  
aperture  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
have  V03
-  
over  >ARGM-EXT
expose  V01
by  
a  
couple  <ARGM-EXT
of  
stops  V01

You  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
in  
the  
image  <ARGM-LOC
if  
there  
is  V02
dirt  <ARG1
as  
that  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
the  
only  
thing  <ARG2
in  
focus  

Cure  V01
is  V01
to  
get  V04
the  
sensor  >ARG1
cleaned  V01

There  
should  >ARGM-MOD
be  V02
a  
Pixel  >ARG1
Mapping  V01
function  V01
in  
the  
menu  <ARGM-LOC
that  >>R-ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
get  V04
rid  V01
of  
them  <ARG1
,  
most  
sensors  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
few  
dead  
and  
flipped  V01
pixels  <ARG1
,  
some  >ARG1

If

for  
a

worker  
s  
visa  <ARG1
and  
it  >>ARG1

you  >>ARG0

in  
the  
same

as  
your

on  
your  >ARG0

can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
take  V31
up  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
work  V01
if  
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
find  V01
something  <ARG1
in  
your

I  >>>ARG0

posted  V01
this

the

does  V01
anyone  >ARG0

.???  

Watch  V02
out  
the

coming  V01
.....  
my

That  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
preferable  <ARG2
but  
it  >>ARG1
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
matter  V01
,  
could  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
something  <ARG2
similar  

It  >ARG0
depends  V01
on  
the  
conditions  <ARG1
of  
your  
skilled

visa  
.  

Your  
visa  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
whether

not  
you  >>>ARG0
are  V03
restricted  V01
to  
work  V01
in  
a  
specific

.  

If  
your  
visa  >>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
restrict  V01
you  <ARG1
from  
taking  VLV
any  >ARGM-EXT
work  V01
in  
New

then  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
work  V01
in  
any  
sector  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
only  >ARGM-ADV
matters  V01
if  
you  >ARG0
received  V01
an  
offer  V01
of  
employment  V01
or  
if  
you  >>>ARG0

currently  >ARGM-TMP

and  
used  V01
that  
job  <ARG1
in  
your  >ARG0
application  V01
to  
get  V01
your  
skilled  
migrant  
visa  <ARG1
.  

In  
Chicago  >ARGM-LOC
,  
what  >ARG2
is  V01
the  
best  
restaurant  >ARGM-LOC
to  
dine  V01
at  <C-ARGM-LOC
on  
a  
budget  <ARGM-MNR
?  

Downtown  
Chicago  
,  
Loop  
,  
North  

Take  V01
the  
red  
line  <ARG1
to  
Clark  <ARG3
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
turn  V01
right  <ARGM-DIR
.  

Walk  V01
2  
blocks  <ARG2
then  >ARGM-TMP
turn  V01
right  <ARGM-DIR
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Walk  V01
2  
more  
blocks  <ARG2
then  >ARGM-TMP
cross  V02
the  
street  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
get  V05
to  
a  
place  >ARG1
called  V01
"  
BIG  
BOWL  <ARG2
"  
.  

THAI  
FOOD  
AND  
ASIAN  
.  

BEST  
PLACE  
EVER  
!!!!!!!!!!!!  

McDonald  
s  

Not  
necessarily  
the  
restaurant  
but  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
order  V02
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
get  V05
there  <ARG2
and  
what  
time  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
go  V02
.  

A  
lunch  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
less  >ARGM-CXN
expensive  V02
than  
a  
dinner  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

You  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
order  V02
appetizers  <ARG1
rather  
than  
a  
full  
meal  
and  
have  V03
just  
as  
good  
a  
dinner  <ARG1
.  

But  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
is  V01
to  
use  V01
coupons  <ARG1
.  

Check  V05
out  
http://www.restaurant.com  <ARG1
lots  
of  
restaurants  
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
look  V01
at  
the  
menu  <ARG1
and  
check  V05
out  
prices  V01
.  

Yo  >>>ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
may  >ARGM-MOD
want  V01
to  
try  V01
"  
small  
neighborhood  <ARG1
"  
restaurants  <C-ARG1
and  
support  V01
family  
run  
places  <ARG1
rather  
than  
the  
large  
corporate  
chains  
.  

Not  
that  
there  
is  V02
anything  <ARG1
wrong  
with  
that  
because  
they  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
employ  V01
local  
people  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
live  V01
and  
shop  V01
in  
the  
area  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Is  V02
there  
any  
cure  V01
for  
mouse  
poison  <ARG2
?  

I  >ARG0
found  V01
a  
poor  
little  
mouse  >ARG0
walking  V01
around  <ARGM-DIR
in  
my  
friend  
s  
house  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
since  
I  >>>ARG0
was  V01
able  V01
to  
catch  V03
it  <ARG1
very  
easily  <ARGM-MNR
(  
normally  >ARGM-ADV
mice  >ARG0
move  V01
at  
the  
speed  <ARGM-MNR
of  
light  
)  
,  
and  
since  
it  >>>ARG0
was  V03
acting  V01
unresponsive  V01
,  
I  >ARG0
thought  V01
it  >>ARG1
was  V03
infected  V01
with  
mouse  
poison  <ARG2
,  
since  
my  
friend  >ARG0
uses  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
that  
the  
mouse  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
die  V01
,  
but  
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
wondering  V01
if  
there  
is  V02
any  
cure  V01
for  
mouse  
poison  <ARG2
?  

I  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
hate  V01
to  
see  V01
the  
poor  
dears  >ARG0
experience  V01
a  
slow  >ARGM-MNR
painful  >ARGM-MNR
death  V01
that  
way  V01
:(  
.  

Without  
knowing  V01
the  
exact  
poison  <ARG1
,  
no  
.  

A  
common  
one  >ARG1
is  V01
arsenic  <ARG2
and  
there  
really  >ARGM-ADV
is  V02
n't  <ARGM-NEG
a  
way  V01
to  
cure  V01
that  <ARG2
.  

Take  V01
the  
mouse  <ARG1
to  
an  
emergency  
vet  <ARG3
and  
have  V04
them  >>ARG0
use  V01
CO2  <ARG1
to  
put  V03
the  
mouse  <ARG1
to  
sleep  <ARG2
.  

Or  >ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
put  V01
the  
animal  <ARG1
in  
a  
snap  
trap  >ARG1
designed  V01
for  
rats  <ARG2
or  
mice  
since  
that  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
only  
really  
humane  
kill  
method  <ARG2
for  
invasive  
animals  
.  

A  
quick  >ARGM-ADJ
cure  V01
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
Arm  <ARG2
&  
Hammer  
to  
it's  
head  
.  

Crayola  
Air  
-  
Dry  
Clay  
?  

Ok  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
VERY  
long  
list  <ARG1
of  
people  >>ARG3
I  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
make  V01
Xmas  
gifts  <ARG1
for  <C-ARG3
and  
one  >ARG1
of  
them  
is  V01
my  
best  
friend  <ARG2
.  

She  >ARG0
loves  V01
giraffes  <ARG1
and  
homemade  
things  
!  

I  >ARG1
am  V01
very  
artistic  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
decided  V01
I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
going  V04
to  
make  V01
her  <ARG3
a  
giraffe  
sculpture  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
much  
money  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
bought  V01
Crayola  
Air  
-  
Dry  
Clay  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
sculpted  V01
the  
giraffe  >ARG1
laying  V01
down  <ARGM-DIR
.  

The  
key  >ARG1
is  V01
...  
I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
few  
problems  <ARG1
:  

1  
.  
I  >>ARG0
tested  V01
it  <ARG1
out  <ARGM-PRD
by  
making  V01
a  
figure  
boat  <ARG1

And  >>ARGM-DIS
after  
4  
days  >>ARGM-TMP
when  
it  
dried  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
fragile  V01
!  

(  
like  
VERY  
not  
in  
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
)  

Is  V02
there  
any  
way  V01
to  
strengthen  V01
it  <ARG1
?  

2  
.  
What  
kind  >>ARG1
of  
paint  
do  V01
I  >>ARG0
use  V01
to  
paint  V02
the  
giraffe  <ARG1
?  

3  
.  
Is  V02
there  
any  
cheap  >ARGM-MNR
way  V01
to  
give  V01
it  <ARG2
a  
shine  <ARG1
like  
I  >ARG0
made  V01
it  <ARG1
in  
a  
kiln  <ARGM-LOC
?  

air  
dry  
clay  >ARG0
works  V01
on  
armatures  <ARG1
,  
the  
clay  >ARG0
has  V03
a  
minor  
shrink  
percent  <ARG1
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
leave  V14
the  
wire  
armature  <ARG1
inside  <ARG1
,  
paint  V01
with  
acrylic  
paint  <ARG2

taking  V01
young  
cat  <ARG1
with  
me  <ARGM-COM
for  
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
out  
of  
state  <ARG3
?  

good  
idea  
?  

i  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
3  
-  
4  
month  
old  
kitten  <ARG1
and  
i  >ARG0
live  V01
in  
forida  <ARGM-LOC
.  

i  >>ARG0
am  V03
going  V02
to  
my  
grandma  <ARG4
s  
in  
north  
carolina  
and  
we  >>>ARG0
are  V03
going  V05
camping  V02
in  
a  
cabin  <ARG1
in  
west  
virginia  
.  

My  
cat  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
outside  
cat  <ARG2
but  
she  >ARG0
loves  V01
it  <ARG1
inside  <ARGM-LOC
.  

she  >>ARG1
is  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
good  V02
in  
a  
carrier  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Should  >ARGM-MOD
i  >ARG0
bring  V01
her  <ARG1
?  

if  
so  
how  
quick  >ARGM-MNR
will  >ARGM-MOD
she  >ARG0
adapt  V01
to  
a  
litter  
box  <ARG2
inside  
?  

thanks  V01

We  >ARG0
took  V01
our  
cat  <ARG1
Mitten  
camping  V02
.  

He  >ARG0
loved  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

But  
he  >ARG1
was  V01
an  
inside  
/  
outside  
cat  <ARG2
(  
only  
one  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
owned  V01
-  
rest  >>ARG1
have  V01
been  V01
100  
0nside  
cats  <ARG2
)  
.  

He  >>ARG2
was  V03
trained  V01
to  
a  
harness  <ARG1
/  
leash  
for  
outside  
time  <ARGM-TMP
but  
he  >>ARG0
knew  V01
to  
use  V01
the  
litter  
pan  <ARG1
inside  <ARGM-LOC
.  

If  
your  
cat  >>>ARG0
is  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
trained  V01
to  
use  V01
the  
litter  
pan  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
a  
problem  <ARG1
taking  V01
her  <ARG1
.  

NO  
!  

changing  V01
its  
surroundings  <ARG1
too  
often  <ARGM-TMP
will  >ARGM-MOD
stress  V03
it  <ARG1
out  <C-V
and  
it  >>>ARG1
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
get  V03
depressed  V01
,  
mean  V03
,  
sick  V05
,  
or  
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
be  V01
around  
you  <ARG2
.  

What  
cleaners  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
use  V01
for  
dusting  V02
around  
my  
parakeet  <ARGM-LOC
?  

What  
cleaners  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
use  V01
to  
dust  V02
around  
my  
budgie  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
pledge  >ARG1
be  V01
ok  <ARG2
?  

If  
not  
,  
what  >ARG1
is  V01
?  

Your  >ARG0
best  >ARGM-ADJ
bet  V01
would  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
be  V01
a  
swiffer  
duster  <ARG2
--  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
require  V01
cleaner  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
use  V01
a  
cleaner  <ARG1
,  
pledge  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
fine  V04
if  
the  
area  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARGM-LOC
you  >ARG0
keep  V01
your  
parakeet  <ARG1
in  <C-ARGM-LOC
is  V01
well  
ventilated  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
had  V03
parakeets  <ARG1
for  
a  
VERY  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
use  V01
pledge  <ARG1
.  

Just  >ARGM-DIS
keep  V02
a  
window  >ARG1
open  V01
for  
a  
while  <<ARGM-TMP
for  
fresh  
air  >ARG1
to  
circulate  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
agree  V01
w  
the  
answer  V01
from  
Nothing  <ARG0
.  

Even  
a  
cotton  
cloth  >>>ARG1
(  
I  >ARG0
like  V01
diapers  <ARG1
)  
that  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
barely  >ARGM-EXT
damp  V03
w  
water  <ARG2
will  >ARGM-MOD
work  V09
fine  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Swiffer  >>ARG0
or  
any  
type  
of  
micro-fiber  
cloth  
is  V01
excellent  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
use  V01
Miracle  
Cloth  <ARG1
,  
they  >>ARG1
're  V01
fantastic  V02
,  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
use  V01
fabric  
softener  <ARG1
or  
dryer  
sheets  
when  >ARGM-TMP
cleaning  V01
them  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG0
ruins  V01
their  
"  
grabbing  
"  
ability  <ARG1

And  >>ARGM-DIS
every

supposed  V02
to  
be  V01
digital  <ARG2
.  

But  
word  
of  
advice  
if  
you  >>ARG0
're  V03
get  V01
your  
girlfriend  <ARG4
a  
laptop  <ARG1
make  V02
sure  V01
it  >ARG1
s  V01
a  
good  
brand  <ARG2
a  
not  
something  
like  
DELL  
,  
Acer  
,  
Asus  
,  
eMachines  
etc  
.  

just  
a  
heads  
up  
.  

yes  
of  
course  
you  
can  
....  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
many  
friends  >>>ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
have  V03
laptops  >ARG1
bought  V01
in  
the  
UK  <ARGM-LOC
that  >R-ARG0
use  V01
them  <ARG1
here  <ARGM-LOC

If  
in  
dongle  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
mean  V01
USB  
stick  <ARG2
then  >ARGM-ADV
yes  >ARGM-DIS
USB  
sticks  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
same  <ARG2
any  
were  >ARG4
you  >ARG0
go  V02
:)  
hope  V01
that  >ARG0
answered  V01
your  
question  <ARG1
.  

How  >>>ARGM-MNR
do  V01
I  >>ARG0
take  VLV
care  V03
of  
my  
newborn  
baby  
fish  <ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG1
am  V01
nervous  V01
that  
my  
other  
fish  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
eat  V01
them  <ARG1
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
what  >ARG1
to  
feed  V01
them  <ARG2
!  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
counted  V01
around  
25  <ARG2
of  
them  
and  
they  >ARG0
currently  >ARGM-TMP
reside  V01
in  
a  
20  
gallon  
tank  <ARG1
.  

You  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
move  V01
all  
the  
babies  <ARG1
into  
a  
fry  
net  
breeder  <ARG2
or  
move  V01
all  <ARG1
of  
the  
bigger  
fish  
(  
also  
the  
parents  
)  
to  
a  
different  
tank  <ARG2
to  
avoid  V01
the  
babies  >>ARG1
getting  V03
eaten  V01
.  

Feed  V01
the  
babies  <ARG2
3  
-  
4  
times  <ARGM-TMP
a  
day  
with  
flakes  <ARG1
.  

Provide  V01
plenty  <ARG1
of  
hiding  
places  
like  
rocks  
,  
plants  
,  
etc  
in  
the  
tank  <ARGM-LOC
.  

It  
s  V01
natural  V03
for  
some  
babies  >>ARG1
to  
be  V03
eaten  V01
by  
adults  <ARG0
and  
if  
all  >ARG0
of  
them  
survived  V01
your  
tank  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
overcrowded  V01
.  

Look  V01
in  
the  
pet  
stores  <ARGM-LOC
for  
"  
fry  
food  <ARG1
"  
or  
"  
baby  
fish  
foods  
"  
.  

what  
kind  >ARG1
of  
newborn  
fish  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
?  

some  
parents  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
eat  V01
there  
fish  <ARG1
till  
a  
certain  
age  <ARGM-TMP
jack  
dempsey  >ARG0
for  
example  >ARGM-ADV
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
eat  V01
there  
offspring  <ARG1
till  
they  >ARG1
mature  V01
but  
i  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
move  V01
the  
baby  
fish  <ARG1
into  
a  
smaller  
tank  <ARG2
and  
feed  V01
them  <ARG2
flakes  <ARG1

or  
are  V03
they  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
supposed  V02
to  
look  V02
like  
they  >ARG1
are  V01
so  
nothing  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
try  V01
to  
eat  V01
them  <ARG1

becca  >>ARG1
is  V01
right  V06
.  

i  >>ARG0
v  V01
owned  V01
beardies  <ARG1
for  
ovr  
3  
yrs  <ARGM-TMP
and  
i  >ARG0
handle  V01
mine  <ARG1
all  
the  
time  <ARGM-TMP
..  
they  >>>ARG1
do  V01
nt  >>ARGM-NEG
go  V08
hard  V04
lik  
eneedle  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
but  
they  >>ARG1
ar  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
pillow  >ARGM-EXT
soft  V02
.  

they  >>ARG0
use  V01
them  <ARG1
to  
look  V02
prickly  <ARG1
..  
would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >>ARG0
try  V01
to  
eat  V01
a  
cactus  <ARG1
[  
if  
u  >ARG0
had  V03
no  
knife  <ARG1
]  
i  >ARG0
know  V01
i  
would  <ARG1
nt  
.  

they  >>>ARG1
puff  V02
out  <ARGM-DIR
to  
look  V02
bigger  V01
and  
badder  
and  
they  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
scratch  V02
you  <ARG1
a  
lil  <ARGM-EXT
if  
u  >>ARG0
r  V01
holding  V01
them  <ARG1
to  
tight  <ARGM-MNR
:)  

They  >>ARG1
re  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-EXT
hard  V04
.  

Beardies  >ARG1
are  V01
actually  <ARGM-ADV
quite  
delicate  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
assuming  V02
it  >ARG1
's  V01
to  
scare  V02
off  <ARG3
predators  <ARG1
/  
like  
how  >ARGM-MNR
they  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
puff  V03
up  
their  
neck  
spikes  <ARG1
to  
make  V02
them  >>ARG1
look  V02
bigger  V01
to  
predators  <ARGM-GOL
or  
enemies  
.  

they  >>ARG0
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
hurt  V01
unless  
you  >>>ARG0
r  V01
stupid  V01
enough  V01
to  
press  V01
on  
them  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-ADV
are  V01
there  <ARG2
as  
an  
adaptation  V01
.  

what  >>ARG2
is  V03
a  
kimberwick  
bit  >ARG1
used  V01
for  <C-ARG2
?  

Used  V01
as  
a  
help  V01
for  
horses  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
are  V01
quite  
strong  
pullers  <ARG2
while  
hacking  V01
,  
hunting  V01
and  
doing  V02
cross  
country  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
curb  
bit  <ARG2
with  
a  
ported  
mouth  
piece  
and  
some  
horses  >ARG0
appreciate  V02
this  <ARG1
to  
give  V01
them  <ARG2
more  
room  <ARG1
in  
their  
mouths  
for  
their  
tongues  
.  

It  >>ARG0
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
as  >ARGM-CXN
precise  V01
as  
a  
pelham  
bit  <C-ARGM-CXN
because  
it  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
uses  V01
one  
rein  <ARG1
,  
though  
the  
modern  
ones  >ARG0
have  V03
two  
or  
three  
slots  >ARG2
on  
which  >R-ARG2
to  
put  V01
the  
reins  <ARG1
.  

The  
lower  V04
the  
reins  <ARG2
,  
the  
stronger  
the  
action  V02
and  
the  
lower  V04
the  
reins  <ARG2
the  
stronger  
the  
action  V02
on  
the  
poll  V01
too  
.  

Useful  
for  
younger  
kids  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
big  
enough  
hands  <ARG1
or  
the  
ability  
to  
handle  V01
two  
reins  <ARG1
independently  <ARGM-MNR
.  

For  
horses  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
are  V01
strong  
pullers  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
gives  V01
you  <ARG2
a  
little  
leverage  V01
and  
curb  
pressure  
.  

It  >>ARG1
's  V01
nice  V01
for  
horses  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
need  V01
a  
little  
more  <ARG1
than  
a  
snaffle  
.  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
that  >>ARG1
's  V01
vague  V01
,  
but  
it  >ARG0
depends  V01
on  
the  
horse  <ARG1
.  

The  
rider  >>ARG0
needs  V01
to  
have  V03
independent  
hands  <ARG1
as  <ARGM-DIS
well  
,  
because  
you  >>>ARG0
do  V01
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
pull  V01
too  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
on  
a  
bit  <ARG1
like  
that  
.

to

which  >>R-ARG1

the

dwarf  
Hamster  <ARG1
tomorrow  <ARGM-TMP
And  
i  >>ARG0
was  V03
just  >ARGM-TMP
talking  V01
to  
my  
Mom  <ARG2
and  
she  >ARG0
said  V01
that  
we  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
take  V11
out  
the  
wheel  <ARG1
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
because  
it  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
disturb  V01
her  
sleep  <ARG1
But  
i  >ARG0
told  V01
her  <ARG2
no  <ARG1
because  
i  >ARG0
said  V01
thei  >ARG1
r  V01
energetic  <ARG2
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
at  
my  
room  >ARG1

wheels  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
make  V01
noise  <ARG1
at  
all  <ARGM-EXT
what  >ARG2
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
the  
price  V01
of  
it  <ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
quite  >ARGM-ADV
sure  V02
,  
you  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  
even  
have  V02
to  
buy  V01
another  <ARG1
,  
all  >>>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
do  V02
,  
is  V01
to  
pour  V01
some  
oil  <ARG1
on  
the  
wheel  <ARG3
,  
or  
even  >ARGM-ADV
put  V01
some  
rubber  <ARG1
on  
it's  
edges  <ARG2
,  
the  
part  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
is  V03
making  V01
the

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
dwarf

who  >>>R-ARG0
HATES  V01
his  
wheel  <ARG1
and  
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
use  V01
it  <ARG1
-  

he  >ARG0
makes  V01
so  
much  
MORE

,  
as  
he  >>>ARG0
plays  V01
and  
digs  V01

jumps  V03
(  
seriously  
)  

wheels  >ARG1
are  V01
relatively  
noiseless  <ARG2
-  

a  
few  
squeaks  >>ARG1
from  
a

are  V01
better  V02
than  
the  
full  
wrath  <ARGM-CXN
of  
a  
bored  
pet  
!  

Change  V01
of  
boarding  
station  <ARG1
?  

How  >ARGM-MNR
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
change  V01
my  
boarding  
station  <ARG1
against  
the  
ticket  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
booked  V03
a  
month  <ARGM-TMP
back  
from  
counter  <ARGM-LOC
?  

My  
origin  
Station  >ARG1
is  V01
Howrah  <ARG2
,  
but  
I  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
board  V01
at  
Asansol  <ARGM-LOC
..  

Does  V01
your  
train  >ARG0
pass  V02
Asansol  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
starting  V01
from  
Howrah  <ARGM-DIR
?  

If  
yes  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
you  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
need  V01
to  
change  V01
it  <ARG1
because  
you  >ARG0
board  V01
later  <ARGM-TMP
.  

If  
no  
,  
you  >>ARG0
'll  
have  V02
to  
go  V02
to  
one  <ARG4
of  
the  
train  
stations  
.  

In  
Calcutta  >ARGM-LOC
there  
is  V02
a  
Foreigner  
's  
reservation  
office  >ARGM-LOC
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
they  >ARG0
speak  V01
English  <ARG1
very  
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
remember  V01
near  
which  
station  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
is  V01
though  <ARGM-DIS
.  

They  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
help  V01
you  <ARG1
and  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
close  <ARG2
to  
a  
train  
station  
in  
Calcutta  
so  >ARGM-ADV
check  V01
a  
few  
big  
ones  <ARG1
?  

Even  
if  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
find  V01
the  
foreigner  
's  
office  <ARG1
you  >>ARG1
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
fine  V04
in  
the  
normal  
Reservation  
Office  <ARGM-LOC
of  
any  
big  
train  
station  
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
where  >>ARGM-LOC
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
get  V01
AND  
change  V01
express  
train  
tickets  <ARG1
.  

well  >>>ARGM-DIS
if  
your  
desired  V01
boarding  
station  >ARG1
comes  V01
after  
more  
than  
2  >ARGM-ADJ
or  
3  
halts  V01
of  
the  
actual  
boarding  
point  <ARG1
,  
then  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
TC  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
cancel  V01
you  
ticket  <ARG1
and  
allot  V01
the  
seat  <ARG1
to  
others  <ARG2
.  

so  >ARGM-ADV
better  >ARGM-ADV
inquire  V01
in  
railway  
office  <ARGM-LOC

Contact  V01
the  
Indian

valid  V02
until  
October  <ARGM-TMP

Problem  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
for  
some  
reason  >>ARGM-CAU
,  
the  
visa  >ARG1
process  V02
took  V10
longer  <ARG1
than  
it  
should  
,  
thus  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
missed  V02
school  <ARG1
this  
semester  <ARGM-TMP
(  
visa  >>ARG1
was  V03
issued  V01
to  
me  <ARG2
about  
25  
days  
after  
school  >ARG1
started  V01
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
attend  V01
)  
,  
now  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
no  
longer  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
go  V02
into  
that  
school  <ARG4
(  
because  
they  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
would  >ARGM-MOD
accept  V01
me  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
on  
September  <ARGM-TMP
of  
2012  
)  
,  
I  >ARG0
found  V01
a  
school  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
accepted  V01
me  <ARG1
for  
may  <ARGM-TMP
2012  
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
use  V01
the  
same  
visa  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
was  V03
issued  V01
to  
me  <ARG2
?  

or  >>ARGM-DIS
do  V01
I  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
reapply  V01
?  

(  
in  
the  
visa  >>ARGM-LOC
itself  
,  
it  >>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
mention  V01
anything  <ARG1
about  
which  
school  >>>ARG1
I  >>>ARG0
m  V03
suppose  V02
to  
attend  V01
,  
and  
problem  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
the  
embassy  >>>ARG0
here  
in  
DC  
are  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
too  >ARGM-EXT

nt  >ARGM-NEG
escape  V01
i  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
buy  V01
it  <ARG4
a

I  >>ARG0
've  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
had  V03
a

the

the  
road  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
always  >ARGM-TMP
beg  V01
for  
spare  
change  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
get  V03
hungry  V01
.  

Should  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
some  
survival  
skills  <ARG1
before  
setting  V07
out  
on  
your  
own  <ARGM-MNR

Vietnamese  
girl  
's  
name  
,  
Mayko  
?  

I  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
thought  V01
Mayko  >ARG1
or  
Meiko  
is  V01
a  
Japanese  
name  <ARG2
.  

The  
Canadian  
Regenesis  
actress  >ARG0
Mayko  
Nguyen  
has  V03
Japanese  >ARG2
connection  V01
or  
is  V01
it  <ARG1
her  
fake  
name  <ARG2
?  

Right  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
find  V01
any  
proven  
source  <ARG1
for  
that  
.  

And  
her  
last  
name  >ARG1
,  
Nguyen  
is  V01
a  
typical  
Vietnamese  
family  
name  <ARG2
...  
anyone  
?  

Certainly  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Nguyen  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
one  <ARG2
of  
first  
names  
of  
many  
people  
in  
Vietnam  
,  
only  
in  
Vietnam  
.  

Mayko  >>ARG1
is  V03
relating  V01
to  
the  
Japanese  <ARG2
.  

In  
Vietnam  >>>ARGM-LOC
,  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
baby  >>ARG1
was  V03
born  V02
,  
they  >>ARG1
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
named  V01
"  
first  
name  <ARG2
"  
according  
to  
that  <ARGM-ADV
of  
their  
fathers  
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
principle  <ARG2
except  
a  
number  <ARGM-ADV
of  
cases  V03
,  
for  
example  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
babies  >>ARG0
are  V01
orphans  <ARG2
or  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
have  V03
father  <ARG1
.  

E.g  
.  

Full  
name  >ARG1
of  
the  
father  
is  V01
:  
"  
Nguyen  <ARG2
Thanh  
Luan  
"  
===>  
Full  
name  >ARG1
of  
the  
son  
/  
daughter  
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
is  V01
"  
Nguyen  <ARG2
..........  
"  
,  
for  
instance  
,  
"  
Nguyen  
Thi  
Thuy  
Lan  
"  
.  

But  >>>ARGM-DIS
if  
the  
babies  >>ARG1
were  V03
born  V02
in  
American  <ARGM-LOC
so  >>>ARGM-ADV
they  >>>ARG1
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
named  V01
in  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
but  
still  >ARGM-TMP
remain  V01
"  
First  
name  <ARG3
"  
in  
order  
to  
recall  V02
about  
their  >ARG1
origination  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
pretty  >ARGM-ADJ
sure  V02
that  
Mayko  >ARG1
is  V01
Japanese  <ARG2
.  

She  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
Canadian  
born  <ARG2
Vietnamese  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure  V02
where  >ARG2
her  
first  
name  >ARG1
is  V01
from  <C-ARG2
...  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
splitter  
/  
filter  <ARG1
between  
my  
ADSL  
and  
ph  
line  
?  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
2  
phones  >ARG1
running  V01
on  
the  
same  
line  <ARG4
and  
the  
ADSL  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V03
connected  V01
to  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
phones  
and  
the  
filter  
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
getting  V01
a  
buzzing  <ARG1
noise  
even  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
disconnected  V01
the  
other  
phone  <ARG1
without  
one  
.  

Why  >>ARGM-CAU
is  V03
it  >ARG0
stil  >ARGM-TMP
doing  V02
this  <ARG1
even  
though  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
the  
other  
phone  >ARG1
connected  V01
?  

Woud  >>ARGM-MOD
it  >ARG1
be  V01
better  V02
if  
I  >>ARG0
got  V01
another  
filter  <ARG1
and  
connected  V01
the  
other  
phone  <ARG1
as  <ARGM-DIS
well  
?  

turn  V07
the  
modem  <ARG1
off  <C-V
and  
see  V01
if  
the  
sound  V02
is  V01
still  <ARGM-TMP
there  <ARG2
...  
could  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
static  <ARG2
on  
the  
line  
...  
if  
the  
sound  V02
is  V01
still  <ARGM-TMP
there  >ARGM-ADV
with  
the  
modem  <ARGM-ADV
off  
then  >ARGM-ADV
the  
problem  >ARG1
is  V01
NOT  <ARGM-NEG
the  
DSL  <ARG2
....  

if  
the  
trouble  >ARG1
goes  V01
away  <ARGM-DIR
with  
the  
modem  <ARGM-MNR
off  
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
make  V02
sure  V01
that  
EVERYTHING  >>ARG1
EXCEPT  
the  
modem  
is  V03
filtered  V02
,  
this  >ARG2
would  >ARGM-MOD
include  V01
the  
alarm  
system  <ARG1
,  
fax  
machine  
,  
satellite  
boxes  
,  
phones  
,  
etc  
...  

if  
everything  >>ARG1
is  V03
filtered  V02
,  
and  
you  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
have  V03
this  
problem  <ARG1
-  
try  V01
changing  V01
the  
filter  <ARG1
-  
if  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
still  <ARGM-TMP
there  >ARGM-ADV
,  
try  V01
doubling  V01
up  <ARGM-PRD
on  
the  
filters  <ARG1
...  

You  >ARG0
need  V01
either  
a  
filter  <ARG1
for  
each  
device  
except  
the  
DSL  
modem  
,  
or  
a  
whole  
home  
filter  >ARG0
which  >R-ARG0
filters  V02
all  
the  
jacks  <ARG1
,  
except  
the  
one  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
the  
DSL

connects  V01

Best  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
to  
change  V01
35  
mm  
film  <ARG1
in  
Holga  
120  
whilst  
out  <ARGM-TMP
and  
about  
?  

I  >>ARG0
've  V01
modified  V01
my  
Holga  >ARG0
120  
to  
take  V01
35  
mm  
film  <ARG1
and  
I  >ARG0
know  V01
that  
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
wind  V01
the  
film  <ARG1
back  <ARG2
,  
you  >>>ARG0
have  V02
to  
open  V01
the  
back  <ARG1
of  
the  
camera  
(  
in  
a  
darkroom  <ARGM-LOC
)  
to  
rewind  V01
the  
film  <ARG1
.  

What  >>ARG1
do  V01
other  
Holga  
owners  >ARG0
do  V02
when  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
change  V01
film  <ARG1
when  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
traveling  V01
?  

Do  V01
you  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
take  V01
a  
changing  
bag  <ARG1
with  
you  <ARGM-COM
?  

What  >ARG2
s  V01
the  
easiest  
thing  <ARG1
?  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
a  
changing  
bag  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
the  
easiest  >ARGM-ADJ
solution  V01
.  

It  >>>ARG0
's  V01
light  
proof  <ARG2
and  
makes  V02
sure  V01
you  >>ARG0
get  V01
no  
problems  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
opening  V01
the  
camera  <ARG1
.  

You  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
work  V01
comfortably  <ARGM-MNR
and  
make  V02
sure  V01
your  
film  >>ARG1
is  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
scratched  V02
etc  
.  

It  
's  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
difficult  V01
to  
find  V01
a  
place  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
is  V01
absolutely  >ARGM-EXT
dark  V02
and  
accessible  V02
to  
you  <ARG0
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
're  V01
outside  <ARG2
.  

A  
changing  
bag  >>>ARG0
folds  V03
neatly  <ARGM-ADV
and  
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
take  V10
much  
space  <ARG1
in  
your  
bag  
.  

A  
film  
changing  
bag  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
handy  >ARGM-MNR
way  V01
of  
unloading  V02
your  
exposed  
film  <ARG2
in  
the  
field  <ARGM-LOC
.

Should  >>ARGM-MOD

it  >>>ARG1

right  V06

no  >ARGM-DIS

it  >ARG1

only  
a

a

You  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
is  >ARG1
was  V01

of

you  >>ARG0

There  
are  V02
some  
things  >ARG1

consider  V02
though  <ARGM-DIS

Rodents  >ARG0
require  V01
special  >ARGM-ADJ
bedding  V02
in  
their  
cages  <<ARGM-LOC
to  
absorb  V01
their  >ARG0

this  >>>ARG1
needs  V01
to  
be  V03
cleaned  V01
regularly  <ARGM-TMP
,  
or  
your

the

will  >ARGM-MOD
collect  V01
water  <ARG1
,  
the  
bedding  V02
will  >ARGM-MOD
absorb  V01
much  <ARG1
of  
it  
,  
and  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V01
able  V01
to  
absorb  V01
the  
urine  <ARG1
quite  
as  
it  
should  <ARGM-MNR
.  

You  >>ARG1
will  
also  
have  V02
to  
be  V01
wary  <ARG2
of  
mold  >ARG1
forming  V01
on  
any  
toys  <ARGM-LOC
or  
hide  
-  
aways  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
.  

You  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
it  >>ARG1
getting  V03
too  >ARGM-CXN
warm  V07
for  
him  <C-ARGM-CXN
too  
often  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Overall  >ARGM-ADV
,  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
solution  V01
,  
but  
you  >>>ARG0
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
keep  V02
him  >ARG2
healthy  V01
and  
pull  V03
it  <ARG1
off  <C-V
if  
you  >>>ARG0
take  V10
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
give  VLV
him  >ARG1
the  
extra  >ARGM-ADJ
care  V03
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
because  
of  
it  <ARGM-CAU
.  

It  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
problem  <ARG2
because  
the  
temperature  >>ARG1
is  V03
constantly  >ARGM-ADV
changing  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
personally  >ARGM-MNR
put  V01
him  <ARG1
somewhere  <ARG2
else  
.  

What  >ARG2
is  V01
the  
most  
interesting  
place  >ARG1
to  
see  V01
in  
South

Only  
a

would  >ARGM-MOD
base  V02
a  
decision  V01
using  V01
the  
cheapest  
surgeon  >ARG0
to  
perform  V01
an  
operation  V01
.  

Cheapest  
surgeons  >>>ARG0
work  V01
out  
of  
some  
small  
clinic  <ARGM-LOC

do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
the  
skills  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0

looking  V01
for  <C-ARG1

.  

Do  V01
you  >>ARG0

put  V01
your

some  
clinic  
doctor  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
I  
would  <ARG1
n't  
.  

You  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
check  V01
with  
one  <ARGM-COM
of  
the  
major  
hospital  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
performance  V01
this  
procedure  V01
like  
Bumrungard

Yanhee

Would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
choose  V01
the

for  
your

race  
car

maybe  
the

too  
?  

Sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
the

comes  V01
expensive  V02

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
have  V03
invasive

you  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD

get  V01

If  
they  >ARG0

you  >ARG1

time

Maybe  >ARGM-ADV
having  V03
an  
experienced  
doctor  <ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
better  V02
than  
some  
guy  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
cheaper  V02
but  
less

my  
Tom  
cat  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
eat  V01
meat  <ARG1
just  
the  
juice  <ARG1
in  
the  
can  
.?  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
open  V01
a  
can  <ARG1
of  
meat  
with  
gravy  
he  >>ARG0
licks  V01
off  <ARGM-PRD
the  
gravy  <ARG1
and  
lets  V01
the  
meat  >ARG1
lay  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
through  V07
it  <ARG1
away  <C-V
.  

Why  
?  

If  
you  >ARG0
knew  V01
what  
kind  >ARG1
of  
"  
meat  
"  
they  >ARG0
put  V01
in  
canned  V01
cat  
food  <ARG1
you  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
understand  V01
this  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
've  V01
had  V03
a  
lot  >>ARG0
of  
cats  
who  >>R-ARG0
refused  V01
to  
eat  V01
the  
canned  V01
food  <ARG1
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
read  V01
the  
label  <ARG1
it  
s  V01
easy  V05
to  
understand  V01
why  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
've  V01
had  V03
cats  <ARG1
for  
35  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
feed  V01
them  <ARG2
dry  
food  <ARG1
.  

They  >>>ARG0
have  V01
done  V02
very  
well  <ARGM-MNR
and  
like  V01
the  
dry  
food  <ARG1
better  <ARGM-ADV
.  

It  >ARG0
had  V03
better  
nutritional  
value  <ARG1
and  
it  >>ARG1
s  V01
also  >ARGM-ADV
less  >ARGM-EXT
expensive  V02
.  

Canned  V01
food  >ARG1
is  V01
often  <ARGM-TMP
suspect  <ARG2
as  
to  
the  
actual  
contents  <ARGM-MNR
and  
you  >>ARG0
're  V03
paying  V01
for  
a  
high  
moisture  
content  <ARG3
instead  
of  
food  
content  <ARG3
.  

There  
are  V02
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
good  
quality  
dry  
cat  
foods  
.  

Read  V01
the  
labels  <ARG1
for  
contents  <ARG3
.  

Your  
cat  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
adjust  V01
quickly  <ARGM-TMP
.  

You  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
have  V03
less  
spoilage  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
sick  V05
take  V01
him  <ARG1
to  
the  
vet  <ARG3
to  
see  V01

If  
he  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
does  V02
this  <ARG1
,  
welcome  
to  
the  
club  
.  

My  
oldest  
female  >ARG0
and  
youngest  
male  
do  V02
this  <ARG1
-  
I  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-DIS
grab  V01
the  
blender  <ARG1
and  
pop  V04
in  <ARGM-DIR
some  
other  
stuff  <ARG1
for  
them  <ARGM-GOL
like  
chicken  
liver  >ARG1
(  
cooked  V01
)  
for  
the  
anemic  
one  
,  
some  
arthritis  
stuff  
for  
the  
oldest  
.  

Even  
if  
you  >ARG0
mash  V01
it  <ARG1
with  
a  
spoon  <ARGM-MNR
he  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
that  <ARG1
,  

What  >ARG2
s  V01
your  
favorite  
part  <ARG1
about  
trail  >ARGM-LOC
riding  V01
?  

My  
favorite  
part  >ARG1
is  V01
going  V02
up  
hill  <ARGM-DIR
and  
cantering  V01
:)  

I  >ARG0
love  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
it  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
depends  V01
on  
how  
good  >ARG2
a  
horse  
your  
horse  >ARG1
really  >ARGM-ADV
is  V01
,  
not  
how  
talented  >ARG2
he  >ARG1
is  V01
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
took  V01
some  
Olympic  
-  
level  
horses  <ARG1
on  
a  
trail  >ARGM-LOC
ride  V01
,  
they  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
it  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
too  >ARGM-EXT
scared  V01
and  
spooky  
.  

It  >>ARG1
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
matter  V01
how  
graceful  >ARG2
your  
horse  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
or  
how  
high  >ARGM-EXT
he  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
jump  V03
,  
or  
how  
well  >>ARGM-MNR
he  >>ARG0
does  VLV
a  
sliding  >ARGM-PRD
stop  V01
.  

What  >>ARG1
matters  V01
is  V01
how  
well  
trained  >ARG2
he  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
and  
how  >>ARG2
good  >>ARG2
your  >ARG1
bond  V01
it  V01
.  

That  >ARG1
is  V01
another  
reason  >ARGM-CAU
why  >R-ARGM-CAU
I  >ARG0
like  V01
competitive  >ARGM-MNR
trail  >ARGM-LOC
riding  V01
also  <<ARGM-DIS
.  

Nobody  >>>ARG0
pays  V01
someone  <ARG2
to  
keep  V02
their  
horse  <ARG1
in  
shape  V01
and  
rides  V01
once  <ARGM-TMP
a  
week  
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
takes  V01
all  
the  
ribbons  <ARG1
at  
the  
show  V04
because  
their  
horse  >>ARG1
is  V01
good  V03
.  

YOU  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
spend  V02
the  
time  <ARG1
training  V01
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
met  V02
one  
stuck  
-  
up  
trail  
rider  <ARG1
!  

Those  >ARG1
are  V01
just  
a  
few  
reasons  >ARGM-CAU
why  >R-ARGM-CAU
I  >ARG0
love  V01
trail  >ARGM-LOC
riding  V01
,  
competitive  <ARGM-MNR
or  
not  
.  

Same  V01
,  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
galloping  V01
in  
an  
open  
space  <ARG1
like  
that  <ARGM-MNR
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
forget  V01
everything  <ARG1
.  

Seeing  V01
the  
nature  <ARG1
and  
wild  
life  
that  
if  
you  >>ARG1
keep  V02
quiet  V04
you  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
get  
up  >ARGM-ADV
close  V10
and  
personal  V02
.  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
had  VLV
several  >ARGM-ADJ
close  >ARGM-ADJ
encounters  V01
with  
both  
foxes  <ARG1
and  
wild  
deer  
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
woodpeckers  >>ARG0
were  V03
pecking  V02
in  
the  
trees  <ARGM-LOC
and  
I  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
sat  V01
and  
watched  V01
.  

Fascinating  
.  

10  
gallon  
nano  
reef  
ideas  
?  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
10  
gallon  
nano  
reef  <ARG1
with  
10  
lbs  
of  
live  
fiji  
rock  
,  
and  
10  
lbs  
of  
live  
carribean  
sand  
.  

I  >>ARG0
am  V01
aware  V01
of  
the  
maintenance  V01
involved  V01
in  
keeping  V01
a  
tank  <ARG1
this  
size  
.  

I  >>ARG0
am  V03
currently  >ARGM-TMP
maintaining  V01
a  
gravity  
level  <ARG1
of  
1.024  
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
10  
gallon  
filter  <ARG1
on  
it  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
have  V03
a  
powerhead  <ARG1
,  
getting  V01
another  <ARG1
soon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
few  
questions  <ARG1
,  
first  <ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
start  V01
a  
sump  
filter  <ARG1
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
have  V03
no  
idea  <ARG1
on  
how  >>>ARGM-MNR
the  
water  >ARG1
intake  V01
and  
water  >ARG1
return  V03
would  >ARGM-MOD
work  V09
.  

How  >ARGM-MNR
would  >ARGM-MOD
I  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
set  V01
a  
sump  <ARG1
for  
this  
10  
gallon  
?  

Do  V01
I  >ARG0
need  V01
a  
protein  
skimmer  <ARG1
or  
any  
other  
equipment  
?  

thanks  V01

Unless  
the  
tank  >ARG0
has  V03
a  
built  
in  
overflow  
box  <ARG1
(  
which  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
certain  V01
it  
does  V01
n't  
)  
then  
you  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
get  V01
one  <ARG1
of  
those  
hang  V01
on  
back  <ARG2
overflow  
boxes  
so  
that  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
install  V01
a  
sump  <ARG1
.  

The  
piping  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
lead  V01
down  <ARG4
into  
your  
sump  
from  
the  
overflow  
box  <ARG3
.  

On  
the  
other  
end  >ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
sump  
,  
you  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
a  
small  
return  
pump  <ARG1
with  
a  
hose  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
puts  V01
the  
water  <ARG1
back  <ARG2
into  
your  
tank  
.  

If  
you  >>>ARG0
're  V03
going  V04
to  
go  V06
through  
the  
trouble  <ARG1
of  
creating  V01
a  
sump  <ARG1
for  
this  
tank  
,  
getting  V01
a  
protein  
skimmer  <ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
a  
bad  
idea  <ARG2
.  

The  
Hydor  
SlimSkim  
Nano  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
good  
nano  
protein  
skimmer  <ARG2
,  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
an  
in  
-  
tank  >ARGM-ADJ
design  V01
that  >R-ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
easily  >ARGM-MNR
sit  V01
in  
your  
sump  <ARG2
.  

NOOK  
Color  
or  
NOOK  
Tablet  
?  

From  
what  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
understand  V01
they  >ARG1
're  V01
pretty  
much  <ARGM-ADV
the  
same  
thing  <ARG2
.  

Some  >>>ARG1
of  
the  
major  >ARGM-EXT
differences  V02
I  >ARG0
see  V01
is  V01
the  
HD  
video  <ARG2
,  
longer  
battery  
life  
,  
and  
faster  
processor  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
the  
NOOK  
Tablet  >ARG0
boasts  V01
.  

Does  V01
the  
Tablet  >>ARG1
have  V03
a  
major  >ARGM-EXT
difference  V02
in  
speed  <ARG3
compared  
to  
the  
Color  <ARG2
?  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
an  
iPad  <ARG1
or  
Kindle  
.  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
want  V01
an  
e-reader  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
does  V02
a  
little  
bit  
more  <ARG1
than  
just  >ARGM-ADV
read  V01
.  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
know  V01
about  
the  
Kindle  
Fire  <ARG1
but  
that  >ARG1
's  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
want  V01
(:  
Does  V01
it  
make  VLV
sense  V02
to  
shell  V03
out  
the  
extra  
fifty  
dollars  <ARG1
?  

Or  >ARGM-DIS
just  >ARGM-ADV
purchase  V01
the  
Color  <ARG1
?  

Well  
I  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
bought  V01
the  
Nook  
Color  <ARG1
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
say  V01
that  
I  >>ARG1
am  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
happy  V01
with  
it  <ARG0
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
like  
a  
mini  
tablet  <ARG2
itself  <ARGM-PRD
!  

When  
I  >ARG0
found  V03
out  
them  >ARG0
came  V11
up  
with  
the  
Nook  
Tablet  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG1
was  V01
pretty  
disappointed  <ARG2
though  <ARGM-ADV
,  
because  
I  >ARG0
bought  V01
my  
Nook  
color  <ARG1
for  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
darn  >ARGM-ADJ
price  V01
!  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
say  V01
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
go  V03
for  
the  
more  
updated  
Nook  
Tablet  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
pretty  >ARGM-ADV
sure  V02
it  >>ARG1
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
worth  V02
it  <ARG2
.  

Have  VLV
fun  V01
!  

Judging  V01
by  
Nook  
Tablet  
's  
processor  <ARG3
it  >>>ARG1
's  V03
supposed  V02
to  
be  V01
quite  >ARGM-ADV
faster  V02
!  

Basically  >ARGM-ADV
Nook  
Tablet  
it  >ARG0
has  V03
more  
memory  <ARG1
,  
better  
battery  
life  
and  
a  
better  
processor  
and  
a  
microphone  
.

Philadelphia

Hey  >>ARGM-DIS

new  
fish  
tank  <ARG1
?

gallon  <ARG1
for  
my  
betta  <ARG4

and  
I  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
want  V01
to  
know  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
properly  >ARGM-MNR
set  V03
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01

a  
beginner  <ARG2
.  

Any  >ARGM-EXT
and  
all  
suggestions  V01
on  
what  >>>ARG1
I  >>>ARG0
need  V01
to  
do  V02
and  
buy  V01
will  >ARGM-MOD
help  V01
.  

Thanks  V01
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
get  V01
the  
tank  <ARG1
make  V02
sure  V01
you  >ARG0
wash  V01
the  
inside  <ARG1
(  
with  
plain  
water  <ARG2
)  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
wash  V01
the  
gravel  <ARG1
(  
with  
only  
water  <ARG2
too  <ARGM-ADV
)  
take  V11
out  
all  
the  
stuff  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is  V03
floating  V01
on  
top  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Add  V02
only  
silk  
plants  <ARG1
as  
plastic  
ones  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
tear  V04
up  
ur  
betta  
s  
delicate  
fins  <ARG1
.  

You  >>ARG0
add  V02
the  
water  <ARG1
and  
put  V01
water  
conditioner  <ARG1
into  
the  
water  <ARG2
.  

Start  V04
up  
your  
filter  <ARG1
(  
sponge  
filters  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
best  <ARG2
for  
bettas  <ARGM-GOL
)  
and  
put  V01
in  <ARG2
a  
heater  <ARG1
and  
set  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
anywhere  <ARG2
between  
78  
-  
82  
.  

Wait  V01
about  
2  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
or  
3  
and  
test  V01
your  
water  <ARG1
.  

If  
everything  >>>ARG1
is  V03
looking  V02
good  V02
you  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
add  V02
you  
betta  <ARG1
to  
its  
new  
home  <ARG2
.  

Lights  >ARG1
are  V01
optinal  <ARG2
since  
fish  >ARG0
need  V01
the  
light  >ARG1
turn  V07
off  
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
anyways  <ARGM-ADV
and  
an  
air  
pump  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
nessasary  <ARG2
since  
they  >ARG0
get  V01
air  <ARG1
from  
the  
surface  <ARG2
.  

ask  V01
the  
people  >ARG0
selling  V01
you  <ARG2
the  
fish  <ARG1
how  >ARGM-MNR
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
set  V03
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
,  
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
know  V01

Add  V02
aquasafe  <ARG1
with  
the  
water  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
put  V01
in  
it  <ARG2
.  

Make  V02
sure  V01
the  
temperature  >>ARG1
is  V01
good  V02
.  

Do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
put  V01
your  
fish  
tank  <ARG1
close  <ARG2
to  
the  
sun  
or  
algae  >ARG1
grow  V01
in  
your  
tank  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Everything  >>ARG1
else  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
good  V02
.  

Make  V02
sure  V01
if  
you  >ARG0
get  V01
new  
fish  <ARG1
that  
they  >ARG1
get  V18
along  
with  
one  
another  <ARG2
.  

Is  V01
it  <ARG1
possible  V01
to  
shoot  V01
lazers  <ARG1
out  
of  
your  
Wang  <ARGM-DIR
?  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
learn  V01
how  <ARG1

I  >ARG0
see  V01
you  >>ARG1
re  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
recovering  V01
from  
the  
accident  <ARG2
.  

You  >>>ARG1
appear  V02
to  
be  V03
feeling  V01
better  V05
though  <ARGM-ADV
.  

That  >>ARG1
's  V01
good  V02
.  
:)  

only  
in  
comic  
books  
and  
sci  
-  
fi  
tv  >ARG3
shows  V04
/  
movies  
...  
:D

Know  V01
that  
there  
are  V02
pros  <ARG1
and  
cons  
to  
laser  
sights  
before  
you  >ARG0
mount  V03
them  <ARG1
on  
your  
wang  <ARGM-LOC
.  

While  
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
accurate  V01
,  
laser  
sights  >>ARG1
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
operate  V01
well  <ARGM-MNR
when  
drunk  <ARGM-TMP
or  
high  
because  
the  
beam  >>ARG1
often  >>ARGM-TMP
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
show  V02
up  
on  
the  
target  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Therefore  >ARGM-ADV
,  
you  >>ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
learn  V01
to  
shoot  V02
manually  <ARGM-MNR
.  

2  

Mount  V03
laser  
sights  <ARG1
on  <ARGM-PRD
away  <ARGM-ADV
by  
removing  V01
the  
hand  
grip  <ARG1
.  

Laser  
grips  >>ARG1
are  V01
the  
most  >ARGM-EXT
common  V01
for  
wangs  <ARG2
.  

The  
laser  >>>ARG0
is  V03
made  V01
into  
the  
hand  
grip  <ARGM-DIR
and  
has  V03
a  
switch  V01
on  
the  
side  <ARGM-LOC
to  
turn  V13
it  <ARG1
on  <C-V
.  

Remove  V01
your  
fingers  <ARG1
from  
the  
existing  
grip  <ARG2
and  
replace  V01
them  <ARG1
with  
your  
new  
laser  
grip  <ARG2
.  

You  >ARG0
have  V03
two  
adjustment  
screws  <ARG1
for  
up  
and  
down  
and  
right  
to  
left  
positions  
.  

3  

Consider  V02
these  
points  <ARG1
for  
mounting  V03
laser  
sights  <ARG1
on  
semi-automatic  
wangs  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Newer  
semi-automatic  
wangs  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
rail  >ARG1
built  V03
into  
the  
receiver  <ARG2
under  
the  
shaft  <ARGM-LOC
.  

This  
rail  >>ARG1
is  V03
used  V01
for  
multi  
purposes  <ARG2
,  
such  
as  
laser  
devices  
or  
flashlight  
devices  
.  

4  

Prepare  V02
to  
mount  V03
the  
laser  
sight  <ARG1
onto  
the  
rail  <ARGM-LOC
on  
the  
wang  
.  

You  >ARG0
have  V03
two  
screws  >ARG3
that  >R-ARG3
attach  V01
the  
sight  <ARG1
to  
the  
wang  <ARG2
.  

Tighten  V01
these  
screws  <ARG1
securely  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Flip  V01
the  
switch  V01
and  
adjust  V01
your  
laser  
sight  <ARG1
according  
to  
the  
directions  V01
in  
the  
owner  
manual  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
comes  V01
with  
the  
laser  
sight  <ARGM-COM
.  

3  
weeks  
old  
baby  
budgie  
alone  
at  
night  
?  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
3  
week  
old  
baby  
budgie  <ARG1
and  
I  >ARG0
noticed  V01
that  
his  
/  
her  
mother  >>ARG1
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
stay  V01
with  
him  <ARGM-COM
in  
the  
nest  <ARG3
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
mention  V01
that  
i  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
separated  V01
the  
father  <ARG1
into  
another  
cage  <ARGM-GOL
close  
to  
the  
'  
nest  
cage  
'  
because  
he  >>ARG0
and  
the  
mother  
were  V03
fighting  V01
.  

He  >>>ARG0
was  V01
so  >ARGM-EXT
eager  V01
to  
go  V02
in  
the  
nest  <ARG4
and  
feed  V01
the  
baby  <ARG2
and  
she  >>>ARG0
always  >>>ARGM-TMP
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
go  V02
right  
away  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
nest  <ARG4
after  
him  <ARGM-TMP
and  
give  VLV
him  >ARG1
a  
fight  V01
right  
there  >ARG2
,  
were  >R-ARG2
the  
baby  >ARG1
was  V01
too  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
thought  V01
it  >>ARG0
was  V01
dangerous  V01
for  
the  
baby  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
moved  V01
him  <ARG1
.  

She  >ARG0
feeds  V01
well  <ARGM-MNR
the  
baby  <ARG2
on  
her  
own  <ARGM-MNR
,  
the  
baby  >ARG1
is  V01
ok  <ARG2
but  
she  >>>ARG1
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
in  
the  
nest  <ARG4
to  
stay  V01
with  
him  <ARGM-COM
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
...  

What  >ARG2
is  V01
the  
problem  <ARG1
?  

Is  V01
this  <ARG1
a  
transitional  
period  <ARG2
for  
the  
baby  
...  
that  
he  >>>ARG1
/  
she  
is  V03
left  V14
alone  V01
much  
more  
time  <<ARGM-TMP
?  

I  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
say  V01
that  
the  
baby  >>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
scream  V01
after  
her  <ARGM-ADV
of  
anything  
...  
he  >ARG0
/  
she  
sleeps  V01
.  

Budgies  >ARG1
are  V01
breast  
feeding  
birds  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
the  
male  >>ARG1
is  V01
bisexual  V01
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
the  
male  >ARG0
gets  V05
his  
titts  <ARG1
out  <ARG2
the  
female  >>>ARG0
gets  V03
mad  V04
with  
him  <ARG0
knowing  V01
he  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
produce  V01
milk  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
's  V01
fine  V04
-  
just  >ARGM-ADV
make  V02
sure  V01
that  
the  
room  >>>ARG1
the  
cage  >ARG1
is  V01
in  <C-ARG2
is  V03
kept  V02
warm  V07
.  

If  
the  
baby  >ARG1
is  V01
feathered  >>>ARGM-ADV
yet  <ARGM-TMP
-  
which  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
sure  V02
he  >ARG1
is  V01
mostly  <ARGM-EXT
-  
he  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
fine  V04
.  

Just  >>ARG0
remember  V01
to  
make  V02
sure  V01
the  
mother  >>ARG0
is  V03
properly  >ARGM-MNR
caring  V03
for  
the  
baby  <ARG1
.  

Ignore  V01
the  
answer  V01
above  
me  <ARGM-LOC
,  
btw  <<ARGM-ADV
!  
^_^  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
text  V01
from  
Canada  <ARGM-DIR
to  
the  
united  
states  <ARGM-DIR
?  

Ok  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG1
is  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
the  
right  
question  <ARG2
,  
but  
my  
question  >ARG1
is  V01
can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
text  V01
from  
a  
united  
states  
number  <ARGM-DIR
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
r  V01
in  
canada  <ARG2
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
send  V01
texts  <ARG1
to  
another  
united  
states  
number  <ARG2
?  

And  >>>ARGM-DIS
do  V01
you  >>ARG2
get  V03
charged  V01
for  
it  <ARG3
?  

I  >>ARG1
m  V01
sorry  V01
if  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
say  V01
the  
question  <ARG1
right  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
hope  V01
somebody  >ARG0
understands  V01
what  >ARG2
I  >ARG0
mean  V01

In  
short  
Yes  
.  

However  
not  
in  
all  
cases  
.  

If  
your  
(  
US  
)  
provider  >>ARG0
has  V03
a  
deal  V01
with  
a  
canadian  
wireless  
company  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
texts  >>ARG1
and  
calls  V02
will  >ARGM-MOD
go  V15
through  
.  

They  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
,  
however  >ARGM-ADV
,  
cost  V01
a  
bunch  <ARG2
.  

The  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
to  
know  V01
for  
sure  <ARGM-EXT
is  V01
to  
call  V02
611  <ARG1
,  
or  
your  
cell  
phone  
help  
line  
,  
and  
ask  V01
.  

The  
phones  >>ARG1
and  
networks  
are  V01
compatible  V01
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
only  
reason  >>ARG1
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
work  V09
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
if  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
,  
say  <ARGM-DIS
,  
a  
cheap  
cell  
phone  
company  <ARG1
..  

Yes  
you  
can  
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
cost  V01
you  <ARG3
lots  <ARG2
of  
money  
unless  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
an  
international  >ARGM-ADJ
plan  V01
.  

Ye$  >ARGM-DIS
you  >ARG0

HELP  V01
with  
my  
Syrian  
Hamster  <ARG1
!!!?  

Hi  >ARGM-DIS
,  
i  >>>ARG0
bought  V01
my  
Syrian  
Hamster  <ARG1
(  
Fernando  
)  
just  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
and  
as  
i  
was  V03
told  V01
to  
leave  V11

him  
to  
get  V04
to  
know  V01
his  
new  
home  <ARG1
.  

As  
i  >ARG0
asked  V01
in  
the  
previous  
questions  <ARG1
he  >>ARG0
was  V03
jumping  V05
up  V_
the  
sides  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
cage  
but  
i  >>ARG2
was  V03
told  V01
is  V01
just  
becouse  
he  >>ARG1
is  V03
panicking  V01
and  
he  >>ARG0
wants  V01
to  
escape  V01
but  
he  >ARG1
is  V01
ok  <ARG2
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
now  >ARGM-TMP
i  >>ARG0
wanted  V01
to  
bouild  V05
up  
relationship  V03
with  
him  <ARG2
so  
i  >ARG0
got  V01
a  
piece  <ARG1
of  
carrot  
and  
i  >ARG0
put  V01
it  <ARG1
on  
my  
hand  <ARG2
,  
i  >ARG1
moved  V01
very  
slowly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
he  >ARG0
suddenly  >ARGM-TMP

CHILL  V02
OUT  
!  

Firstly  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
your  
hammie  >>ARG1
was  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
stressed  V03
out  
,  
he  >ARG0
wanted  V01
attention  V02
.  

Secondly  >ARGM-TMP
,  
that  >ARG1
is  V01
normal  
behavior  <ARG2
as  
they  >ARG0
use  V01
the  
wheels  <ARG1
in  
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Thirdly  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
just  >>ARGM-DIS
put  V01
your  
hand  <ARG1
in  
his  
cge  <ARG2
ans  
leave  V14
it  <ARG1
their  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
willl  >>ARGM-MOD
eventually  >>ARGM-TMP
come  V01
and  
explore  V01
it  <ARG1
and  
them  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
handle  V01
him  <ARG1
a  
little  
bit  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Hope  V01
I  >ARG0
helped  V01
!  

Give  V01
him  <ARG2
time  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
got  V01
him  <ARG1
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >>>ARG0
's  V01
probably  >>ARGM-ADV
still  >>ARGM-TMP
scared  V01
and  
unsure  V01
.  

Once  
he  >>>ARG1
has  V01
properly  >>ARGM-MNR
settled  V05
down  
,  
got  V03
use  <ARG2
to  
the  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
smells  V01
and  
noises  
he  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
fine  V04
.  

Once  
he  >ARG1
is  V01
more  
comfy  >ARGM-TMP
with  
his  
surroundings  
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
start  V01
handling  V01
him  <ARG1
and  
getting  V04
to  
know  V02
each  
other  <ARG1
more  <ARGM-EXT
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
just  >ARGM-ADV
give  V01
him  <ARG2
time  <ARG1
for  
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Is  V01
Fujairah  <ARG1
a  
nice  
place  >ARGM-LOC
to  
live  V01
in  <C-ARGM-LOC
?  

My  
family  >>>ARG1
and  
I  
are  V03
planning  V01
to  
shift  V01
to  
Fujairah  <ARG2
in  
a  
couple  <ARGM-TMP
of  
years  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
needed  V01
to  
know  V01
if  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
suitable  
place  >ARGM-LOC
to  
live  V01
in  <C-ARGM-LOC
and  
in  
what  
ways  V01
.  

Also  
that  
,  
I  >ARG0
heard  V01
in  
the  
next  
few  
years  >>ARGM-TMP
Fujairah  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
as  >ARGM-CXN
good  V02
as  
Dubai  <C-ARGM-CXN
,  
is  V01
it  >ARG1
true  V01
?  

I  >>ARG1
'd  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
happy  V01
if  
someone  >ARG0
helps  V01
,  
especially  
someone  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
has  V01
been  V01
to  
Fujairah  <ARG2
or  
lives  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  
:)  

I  >ARG0
LIVE  V01
THERE  <ARGM-LOC
!  

...  
I  >>>ARG0
ve  V01
been  V03
living  V01
in  
Fujairah  <ARGM-LOC
my  
entire  
life  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
that  
it  >>ARG1
is  V03
developing  V02
in  
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
2012  >>>ARG1
is  V03
going  V04
to  
be  V01
a  
great  
year  <ARG2
for  
Fujairah  
as  
we  >ARG0
have  V03
A  
LOT  <ARG1
of  
projects  >>ARG1
to  
be  V03
done  V02
by  
2012  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Things  >ARG1
to  
do  V02
in  
Fujairah  
..  

It  >ARG1
s  V01
between  
sea  <ARG2
and  
mountains  
so  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
camp  V02
on  
beach  <ARG1
or  
between  
mountains  
!  

...  
Fishing  V01
,  
Jet  
skies  
,  
snorkeling  V01
,  
diving  V01
are  V01
some  <ARG2
of  
the  
things  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
for  
fun  V01
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
now  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
finishing  V01
a  
road  <ARG1
between  
Fujairah  
and  
Dubai  
in  
45  
minutes  
only  
!  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
no  >>ARGM-DIS
it  >>ARG1
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
as  >ARGM-CXN
good  V02
as  
Dubai  <C-ARGM-CXN
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
s  V01
quieter  V04
and  
more  
peaceful  
,  
and  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
go  V02
to  
Dubai  <ARG4
in  
45  
mins  <ARGM-TMP
.  

please  >ARGM-DIS
let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
if  
you  >ARG0
need  V01
anything  <ARG1
else  

Visited  V01
Fujairah  <ARG1
when  
in  
Dubai  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Nothing  
like  
Dubai  
,  
and  
never  >ARGM-NEG
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
!  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
the  
economics  <ARG1
of  
Fujairah  
but  
Dubai  >ARG1
is  V01
basically  <ARGM-ADV
bankrupt  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
end  V03
up  
like  
them  <ARG2
!  

Unless  
you  >>>ARG0
have  V03
a  
particular  
skill  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
need  V01
-  
and  
firm  >ARGM-ADJ
job  >ARG1
offer  V01
before  
going  V02
-  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
think  V01
twice  <ARGM-TMP
about  
it  <ARG2
!  

Are  V02
there  
any  
new  
Gaming  
console  <ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
should  >ARGM-MOD
i  >ARG0
buy  V01
PS3  <ARG1
or  
X  
-  
BOX  
Kinect  
.  

Or  
even  
N  
-  
DS  
or  
PSP  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
afraid  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
buy  V01
PS3  <ARG1
or  
X  
-  
BOX  
then  >ARGM-TMP
a  
newer  
version  >ARG1
comes  V09
out  
.  

(  
Same  
for  
N  
-  
DS  
and  
PSP  
)  

Wii  
U  >>>ARG1
has  V01
been  V03
announced  V01
as  
well  
as  
the  
PS4  <C-ARG1
however  >ARGM-ADV
the  
PS4  >ARG1
is  V01
only  <ARGM-ADV
in  
development  V02
while  
the  
Wii  
U  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
out  <ARG2
next  
year  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Microsoft  >>ARG0
has  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
announced  V01
there  
new  
console  <ARG1
yet  <ARGM-TMP
though  
it  >>>ARG1
is  V03
believed  V01
to  
be  V01
in  
the  
works  V11
.  

No  
matter  >>ARGM-ADV
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
buy  V01
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
a  
newer  
version  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
feel  V02
X  
-  
BOX  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
very  
smooth  
system  <ARG2
i  >ARG0
own  V01
it  <ARG1
like  <ARGM-DIS
3  
years  <ARGM-TMP
,  
it  >>ARG1
s  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
compatible  V01
to  
previous  
versions  <ARG2
and  
mostly  
important  >ARGM-ADV
i  >ARG1
was  V01
very  
comfortable  <ARG2
with  
the  
User  
Interface  
and  
the  
JOYSTICK  
....  
coz  
you  >>>ARG0
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
wan  V01
a  
hold  V01
a  
joystick  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
gives  V01
you  <ARG2
discomfort  <ARG1
.  

XBOX  
Joys  >ARG1
are  V01
soo  
comfyy  <ARG2
.....  

Performance  V02
-  
You  >ARG0
get  V01
the  
same  <ARG1
in  
all  
,  
just  >ARGM-ADV
get  V01
a  
good  
TV  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
about  
the  
playstation  
situation  <ARG1
but  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
know  V01
that  
Microsoft  >>ARG0
has  V01
said  V01
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see  V01
the  
Xbox  <ARG1
360  
as  
being  V01
even  
halfway  
through  
its  
lifetime  <ARG2
.  

Since  
they  >ARG0
released  V01
kinect  <ARG1
this  >ARG1
was  V01
kind  <ARGM-EXT
of  
their  >ARG0
way  V01
of  
releasing  V01
a  
new  
Xbox  <ARG1
so  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
plan  V01
on  
making  V01
another  
one  <ARG1
for  
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
know  V01
they  >>ARG0
have  V01
already  >ARGM-TMP
announced  V01
a  
new  
wii  <ARG1
though  <ARGM-ADV
and  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
what  >>ARG1
Sony  >>ARG0
has  V01
said  V01
about  
playstation  <ARG3
but  
again  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
get  V01
an  
Xbox  >>ARG1
(  
which  >>R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
personally  >ARGM-ADV
think  V01
is  V01
the  
best  <ARG2
anyways  <ARGM-ADV
)  
you  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
set  V08
for  
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
.  

What  >ARG2
is  V01
the  
typical  
lifespan  <ARG1
of  
a  
cat  
?  

My  
cat  >>>ARG1
had  VLV
a  
seizure  V03
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
and  
was  V01
ill  V01
.  

In  
fact  
every  
once  
in  
a  
while  
he  >>>ARG1
seems  V01
to  
get  V03
ill  V01
in  
one  
way  V01
or  
another  
;  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG1
bounces  V02
back  
like  
nothing  >>ARG1
has  V01
happened  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG0
did  V02
an  
internet  >ARG1
search  V01
to  
ascertain  V01
how  
long  >ARGM-EXT
cats  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
live  V01
,  
however  >ARGM-ADV
different  
sources  >ARG0
give  V01
wildly  
different  
lifespans  <ARG1
.  

My  
cat  >>ARG1
is  V01
18  
years  >ARG2
old  V01
.  

In  
your  >ARG0
experience  V01
how  
long  >>>ARGM-EXT
do  V01
cats  
do  V01
cats  >ARG0
typically  >ARGM-ADV
live  V01
?  

Is  V01
he  <ARG1
on  
his  
last  
legs  <ARG2
or  
is  V01
it  <ARG1
conceivable  <ARG2
that  
he  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
around  <ARG2
for  
another  
15  
years  <ARGM-TMP
as  
is  V03
claimed  V01
by  
some  <ARG0
of  
the  
sources  >>>ARG1
i  >>>ARG0
ve  V01
been  V03
looking  V01
at  <C-ARG1
?  

from  
my  >ARG0
experience  V01
with  
my  
cats  <ARG1
13  
-  
18  
years  
depending  
on  
the  
breed  
.  

At  
18  
years  
,  
your  
cat  
has  V01
had  
a  
long  
life  
.  

Indoor  
cats  >>>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
are  V03
well  >ARGM-MNR
cared  V03
for  <ARG1
typically  >ARGM-ADV
live  V01
11  
-  
15  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Older  
males  >>>ARG1
often  >ARGM-TMP
tend  V02
to  
have  VLV
urinary  
tract  >ARG0
issues  V02
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
your  
cat  >>ARG0
has  V01
done  V02
very  
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Male  
cats  >ARG0
very  
seldom  >ARGM-TMP
live  V01
past  
14  
-  
15  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Stories  >>>ARG1
of  
cats  >ARG0
living  V01
more  
than  
25  
years  <ARGM-TMP
are  V01
rare  V02
.  

I  >>ARG0
ve  V01
had  V03
cats  <ARG1
for  
35  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
the  
oldest  
cat  >>>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had  V03
was  V01
a  
23  
year  
old  
female  <ARG2
and  
she  >ARG1
was  V01
exceptional  <ARG2
.  

By  
comparison  V01
,  
outdoor  
cats  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
life  
expectancy  <ARG1
of  
3  
-  
7  
years  
depending  
on  
how  
many  
predators  >ARG1
are  V01
in  
the  
local  
environment  <ARG2
.  

According  
to  
a  
couple  
sources  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
world  
record  >ARG1
for  
the  
oldest  
cat  
was  V01
a  
cat  >ARG0
in  
Devon  
,  
England  
who  >R-ARG0
reportedly  >ARGM-ADV
live  V01
to  
the  
age  <ARGM-TMP
of  
36  
.  

I  >ARG0
knew  V02
a  
cat  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
died  V01
in  
its  
sleep  <ARGM-MNR
aged  V01
21  <ARG2
.  

Anything  >ARG1
after  
12  
is  V01
a  
bonus  <ARG2
.  

Gaining  V02
and  
loosing  V02
my  
cockatiel  
's  
trust  <ARG1
...  
?  

I  >ARG0
thought  V01
that  
I  >>ARG0
had  V01
gained  V02
my  
cockatiel  
's  
trust  <ARG1
,  
but  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG1
's  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
coming  V01
to  
me  <ARG4
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
open  V01
his  
cage  <ARG1
.  

What  >>ARG1
do  V01
I  >ARG0
do  V02
?  

Did  V01
anything  >ARG1
happen  V01
before  
losing  V02
his  
trust  <ARG1
?  

Birds  >>ARG1
are  V01
hard  V02
to  
gain  V02
trust  <ARG1
with  
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
's  V03
lost  V02
so  
easily  <ARGM-MNR
!  

A  
simple  >ARGM-ADJ
hand  >ARGM-MNR
gesture  V01
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
resorted  V01
to  
him  >>ARG0
being  V01
afraid  V01
of  
you  <ARG1
.  

Eating  V01
by  
his  
cage  <ARGM-LOC
and  
keeping  V01
a  
"  
sleep  
cage  <ARG1
"  
in  
your  
room  <ARGM-LOC
is  V01
a  
good  
idea  <ARG2
.  

Birds  >>ARG0
eat  V01
and  
sleep  V01
with  
their  
flock  <ARGM-COM
,  
not  
predators  
.  

Keep  V02
his  
cage  >ARG1
open  V01
and  
go  V08
on  
your  
computer  <ARG2
,  
or  
read  V01
a  
book  <ARG1
,  
etc  
and  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
he  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
come  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR
to  
you  <ARG4
.  

Let  V01
him  >ARG0
go  V02
at  
his  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-ADJ
pace  V01
,  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
rush  V01
with  
him  <ARG1
,  
and  
never  >ARGM-NEG
ever  
resort  V01
to  
physical  
violence  <ARG1
with  
your  
bird  <ARGM-MNR
.  

This  >ARG0
with  >ARGM-MOD
ruin  V01
your  >ARG1
bond  V01
,  
and  
you  >ARG0
probably  >ARGM-ADV
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
another  
chance  V02
to  
build  V01
one  <ARG1
.  

Patience  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
key  <ARG2
.  
=)  

he  >ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
a  
cuddly  
,  
loving  
,  
tame  
bird  <ARG2
,  
but  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
have  V03
a  
friendly  >ARGM-MNR
bond  V01
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
then  
again  >ARGM-ADV
he  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
!  

dat  
bird  >>ARG1
is  V01
smart  V06
.  

like  
my  
dogs  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
like  V01
me  <ARG1
and  
trust  V02
me  <ARG1
,  
but  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
open  V01
the  
door  <ARG1
to  
get  V05
them  <ARG1
outside  <ARG2
,  
they  >ARG0
run  V02
from  
me  <ARGM-DIR
,  
they  >ARG0
know  V01
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V03
going  V04
to  
take  V01
them  <ARG1
outside  <ARG3
and  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

the  
bird  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
know  V01
that  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
open  V01
the  
cage  
door  <ARG1
it  >ARG1
means  V01
that  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
put  V01
him  <ARG1
in  
the  
cage  <ARG2
,  
and  
birds  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
usually  >ARGM-ADV
like  V01
cages  <ARG1
.  

so  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
the  
bird  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
trust  V02
you  <ARG1
,  
but  
still  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like  V01
the  
cage  <ARG1
.  

How  >ARGM-MNR
to  
make  V02
a  
breyer  
horse  
stable  <ARG1
?  

Hi  >ARGM-DIS
i  >ARG1
m  V01
a  
big  
fan  <ARG2
of  
breyer  
horses  
!  

My  
breyers  >ARG0
need  V01
stables  <ARG1
or  
barns  
though  <ARGM-ADV
.....  
and  
I  >ARG0
need  V01
directions  V01
and  
materials  
on  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
make  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V01
maybe  
5  
stalls  <ARG1
per  
barn  
so  >ARGM-ADV
make  V02
sure  V01
the  
stalls  >>ARG1
are  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
that  >ARGM-CXN
big  V01
so  
it  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
fit  V01
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
know  V01
where  >ARG2
to  
buy  V01
the  
materials  <ARG1
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
make  V02
this  >ARG1
as  >ARGM-CXN
simple  V02
as  
you  
can  <C-ARGM-CXN
for  
my  
dad  >ARG0
does  V02
nt  <ARGM-NEG
really  <ARGM-ADV
not  
that  
good  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Pictures  >ARG0

How  >ARGM-MNR
can  >ARGM-MOD
i  >ARG0
get  V04
my  
kitten  >>ARG0
to  
stop  V01
biting  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
plays  V01
?  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
kitten  >ARG1
who  >R-ARG1
just  >ARGM-TMP
turned  V02
3  
months  <ARG2
today  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
good  
kitty  <ARG2
,  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
plays  V01
he  >ARG0
bites  V01
REALLY  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Almost  
every  
day  >ARGM-TMP
he  >>>ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
even  >ARGM-ADV
wake  V02
me  <ARG1
up  <C-V
like  
5  
am  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
morning  
,  
trying  V01
to  
bite  V01
my  
arm  <ARG1
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
move  V01
it  <ARG1
I  >ARG0
guess  V01
he  >ARG0
figures  V01
I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
playing  V01
.  
x.x  

I  >ARG0
read  V01
somewhere  <ARGM-LOC
that  
you  >>>ARG0
have  V02
to  
hold  V01
his  
mouth  <ARG1
together  <ARGM-ADV
,  
and  
keep  V02
it  <ARG1
that  
way  <ARG2
til  
he  >ARG1
panics  V01
.  

That  >>ARG1
seems  V01
cruel  V01
to  
me  <<ARG2
though  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

Any  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
??  

Do  V01
you  >ARG0
think  V01
he  >>ARG0
's  V03
teething  V01
?  

It  >>ARG1
's  V03
getting  V03
out  
of  
hand  <ARG2
.  

Yeah  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
thought  V01
that  
the  
holding  V01
his  
mouth  <ARG1
thing  >>ARG2
sounded  V01
wrong  V04
.  

No  
worries  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
i  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
try  V01
.  

He  >>ARG0
does  V01
have  V03
toys  <ARG1
,  
a  
scratching  
post  
,  
LOTS  
of  
mice  
,  
balls  
,  
yarn  
,  
a  
feathery  
birdy  
toy  
,  
etc  
.  

He  >>ARG0
'd  >>ARGM-MOD
just  >>ARGM-ADV
randomly  >>ARGM-MNR
walk  V01
up  
to  
you  <ARG2
and  
start  V01
the  
biting  V01
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
put  V01
him  <ARG1
off  
of  
my  
bed  <ARG2
,  
he  >ARG0
jumps  V03
back  
on  <ARGM-DIR
and  
same  
thing  
.  

he  >>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
teething  V01
but  
i  >>ARG0
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
it  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
stopped  V01
.  

maybe  >ARGM-ADV
buy  V01
him  <ARG4
toys  >>ARG0
that  >R-ARG2
he  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
play  V01
with  <C-ARG2
that  >R-ARG0
give  V01
him  <ARG2
a  
way  V01
to  
use  V04
his  
energy  <ARG1
up  <C-V

yes  >>ARGM-DIS
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
hold  V01
any  
animal  
s  
mouth  <ARG1
shut  <ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG0
wil  >ARGM-MOD
close  V01
their  >ARGM-GOL
air  >ARG0
way  V01
,  
he  >ARG1
s  V01
just  
a  
kitty  <ARG2
and  
they  >ARG1
are  V01
very  
rambunctious  <ARG2
,  
get  V01
him  <ARG4
toys  <ARG1
.  

lots  
of  
them  
,  
feather  
ones  >ARG1
work  V09
best  <ARGM-ADV
,  
also  >>ARGM-ADV
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
bites  V01
you  <ARG1
in  
the  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
put  V01
him  >ARG0
down  <ARGM-DIR
off  
your  
bed  <ARG2
,  
to  
show  V01
him  <ARG2
that  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
tolerate  V01
that  <ARG1
,  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
he  >>ARG0
s  V03
also  >ARGM-ADV
probably  >ARGM-ADV
teething  V01
,  
so  
toys  >ARG1
are  V01
your  >ARG0
best  >ARGM-ADJ
bet  V01

Which  
rat  
cage  >>ARG1
is  V01
better  V02
?  

Hi  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>>ARG0
want  V01
to  
get  V01
a  
few  
pet  
rats  <ARG1
and  
need  V01
a  
rat  
cage  <ARG1
.  

(  
Apart  
from  
the  
wire  
flooring  >>>ARG1
which  >>>R-ARG1
i  >>>ARG0
am  V03
going  V04
to  
cover  V02
)  
Which  >>ARG1
of  
these  
two  
cages  
is  V01
better  V02
:  

http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_2079wt_893

I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
decide  V01
between  
height  <ARG1
or  
width  
.  

http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_  

This  
one  >>ARG1
is  V01
better  V02
for  
rats  <ARG2
.  

You  >>ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
want  V01
to  
go  V03
higher  <ARG1
rather  
than  
wider  
for  
rats  <<ARG2
.  

They  >>ARG0
LOVE  V02
to  
climb  V01
.  

You  >>>ARG0
will  
have  V02
to  
cover  V02
the  
wire  
flooring  <ARG1
like  
you  >ARG0
said  V01
,  
and  
make  V01
fleece  
covers  <ARG1
for  
the  
stairs  
,  
so  
no  
ratty  
feet  >>>ARG1
get  V03
caught  V03
and  
broken  V01
.  

This  
cage  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
hold  V13
about  
2  
-  
3  
rats  <ARG1
.  

Both  >ARG1
are  V01
equal  
length  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
go  V03
for  
the  
taller  
one  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
use  V01
this  
cage  <ARG1
it  
's  V01
best  V02
to  
remove  V01
the  
wire  
shelves  <ARG1
altogether  <ARGM-EXT
and  
replace  V01
it  <ARG1
with  
hammocks  <ARG2
and  
the  
like  
.  

I  >ARG0
used  V01
one  <ARG1
of  
these  
cages  
short  
term  <ARGM-TMP
for  
a  
pet  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
that  >ARGM-EXT
great  V01
to  
be  V01
honest  V01
,  
pretty  
cheaply  >ARGM-MNR
made  V01
,  
the  
door  
springs  >>ARG0
are  V01
annoying  V01
and  
it  >>ARG1
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
last  V01
very  
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Here  >ARG2
are  V01
some  
better  
options  <ARG1
IMO  <ARGM-DIS

These  >>ARG1
are  V01
all  >ARGM-ADV
a  
bit  
more  >ARGM-CXN
expensive  V02
than  
your  >ARG0
choice  V01
but  
if  
you  >ARG0
ebay  >ARG1
search  V01
the  
names  <ARG2
you  >>>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
find  V01
one  <ARG1
second  
hand  <ARGM-MNR
...  
better  
paying  V01
for  
a  
second  
hand  
one  <ARG3
in  
good  
condition  
than  
a  
poorly  
made  
new  
one  
IMO  
.  

The  
First  
One  >>ARG1
Is  V01
much  >ARGM-EXT
Better  V02
!  

I  >ARG0
Have  V03
This  
Exact  
Cage  >ARG1
,  
Bought  V01
From  
The  
Exact  
Ebay  
User  <ARG2
.  

It  >>ARG1
s  V01
Really  >ARGM-EXT
Good  V02
And  
The  
Rat  
Calculater  >ARG0
Says  V01
Is  V01
Big  V01
Enough  V01
For  
5  
Rats  <ARG3
,  
But  
I  >ARG0
Would  >ARGM-MOD
Put  V01
A  
Maximum  <ARG1
Of  
4  
In  
It  <ARG2
Really  <ARGM-ADV
:)  

is  V01
under  
tank  >ARG2
heating  V01
or  
side  
tank  >ARG2
heating  V01
better  V02
for  
a  
corn  
snake  <ARG2
?  

i  >>ARG0
was  V03
reading  V01
the  
package  <ARG1
for  
a  
tank  
heater  >ARG1
i  >ARG0
bought  V01
for  
my  
40  
gallon  
tank  <ARG4
for  
my  
snake  
and  
it  >ARG0
said  V01
it  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
put  V01
under  
the  
tank  <ARG2
or  
on  
the  
side  
.  

i  >>ARG1
m  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
worried  V01
about  
damaging  V01
the  
surface  >ARG2
my  
tank  >ARG1
is  V01
on  <C-ARG2
because  
i  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
prop  V01
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
off  
the  
surface  <ARGM-DIR
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
.  

from  
my  >ARG0
understanding  V01
,  
if  
it  >>ARG1
s  V03
heated  V01
from  
the  
bottom  <ARGM-DIR
,  
my  
snake  >ARG0
risks  V01
burning  V01
its  
belly  <ARG1
if  
it  >>ARG1
burrows  V01
and  
rests  V01
directly  <ARGM-MNR
on  
top  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
glass  
over  
the  
heater  
unless  
i  >>ARG0
buy  V01
some  <ARG1
of  
that  
reptile  
carpet  
to  
put  V01
under  
the  
substrate  <ARG2
,  
but  
it  >>ARG0
has  V03
better  >ARGM-ADJ
heat  >ARG1
distribution  V01

if  
it  >ARG1
s  V01
from  
the  
side  <ARG2
i  
do  V01
nt  
have  V02
to  
worry  V02
about  
propping  V01
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
,  
but  
the  
snake  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
burn  V01
itself  <ARG1
if  
it  >ARG0
slithers  V01
along  
the  
side  <ARGM-DIR
of  
the  
tank  
and  
i  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
read  V01
that  
it  >>ARG0
does  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
distribute  V01
heat  <ARG1
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
?  

what  >ARG2
are  V01
your  >ARG0
suggestions  V01
and

UTH's  <ARG1
on  
all  <ARG2
of  
my  
burrowing  V01
snakes  <ARG0
.  

they  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
move  V01
if  
they  >>ARG1
get  V03
too  >ARGM-EXT
warm  V07
-  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
like  
a  
heat  
rock  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
avoid  V01
at  
all  
costs  <ARGM-MNR
.  

i  >ARG0
usually  >ARGM-TMP
put  V01
my  
own  
natural  
rock  <ARG1
over  
the  
UTH  <ARG2
and  
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
perfectly  >ARGM-EXT
fine  V04
.  

i  >>>ARG0
have  V03
over  
40  
corns  <ARG1
,  
kings  
,  
and  
milks  
and  
have  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
had  V03
a  
problem  <ARG1
with  
the  
UTH  
system  
.  

on  
the  
side  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
waste  V01
-  
leave  V12
it  <ARG1
on  
the  
bottom  <ARG2
.  

good  
luck  
!  

Bottom  
if  
you  >>ARG1
are  V01
worried  V01
about  
the  
snake  >ARG0
burning  V01
itself  <ARG1
put  V01
something  <ARG1
overt  
it  <ARG2
like  
newspaper  <C-ARG1

for  
mine  <<ARG2

like  V01
it  <ARG1

put  V01
the  
heater  <ARG1
on  
the  
snake  <ARG2
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
love  V01
it  <ARG1

Question  
about  
the  
sinking  V01
of  
the  
Titanic  <ARG1
?  

After  
the  
sinking  V01
of  
the  
Titanic  <ARG1
in  
1912  <ARGM-TMP
,  
was  
there  
a  
law  >ARG1
made  V01
so  
that  
ships  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
carry  V01
enough  
lifeboats  >ARGM-ADV
to  
save  V02
everybody  <ARG1
on  
a  
ship  
if  
it  >>ARG1
was  V03
sinking  V01
?  

If  
yes  >ARGM-ADV
,  
was  
Canada  >ARG1
involved  V01
in  
this  
act  <ARG2
/  
law  
?  

Sorry  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
very  >ARGM-EXT
nervous  V01
after  
watching  V01
the  
movie  <ARG1
.  

SOLAS  >>ARG1
(  
Safety  
Of  
Life  
At  
Sea  
)  
,  
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
an  
international  
maritime  
treaty  <ARG2
,  
came  V06
about  
in  
response  V01
to  
the  
tragedy  <ARG1
of  
the  
Titanic  
.  

Today  >ARGM-TMP
,  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
primary  
safety  
law  >ARG0
affecting  V01
virtually  
all  
ships  <ARG1
,  
regardless  <ARGM-ADV
of  
country  
of  
registration  V02
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
ever  >ARGM-TMP
go  V02
on  
a  
cruise  
ship  <ARG1
,  
you  >>>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
required  V01
to  
attend  V01
a  
SOLAS  
muster  
drill  <ARG1
(  
lifeboat  
drill  
)  
within  
24  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
of  
sailing  V01
.  

Most  
ships  >ARG0
perform  V01
this  
drill  <ARG1
before  
even  >ARGM-ADV
leaving  V11
the  
dock  <ARG1
.  

SOLAS  >ARG0
covers  V01
just  
about  
every  
aspect  <ARG1
of  
safety  
at  
sea  
,  
including  
minimum  
safety  
equipment  
,  
practices  
,  
and  
standards  
,  
lifeboats  
,  
navigation  
practices  
,  
fire  >ARG2
protection  V01
,  
and  
so  
on  
.  

We  >>ARG1
are  V01
much  >ARGM-EXT
safer  V01
today  <ARGM-TMP
on  <ARGM-LOC
board  
ship  
due  
to  
SOLAS  <ARGM-CAU
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
suppose  V01
if  
any  
good  >ARG1
came  V09
out  V_
of  
the  
Titanic  
tragedy  <ARG0
,  
the  
adoption  V01
of  
SOLAS  <ARG1
is  V01
probably  <ARGM-ADV
it  <ARG2
.

Edit  
:  
Also  >ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
forgot  V01
to  
mention  V01
earlier  <ARGM-TMP
,  <<ARG1
most  
(  
if  
not  
all  
)  
cruise  
ships  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
practice  V01
lifeboat  
drills  <ARG1
weekly  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
it  
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
uncommon  V01
to  
see  V01
them  >ARG0
to  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
launch  V01
the  
lifeboats  <ARG1
into  
the  
water  <ARGM-DIR
as  
part  <ARGM-ADV
of  
their  
drill  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
are  V01
in  
port  <ARG2
.  

This  >>>ARG0
not  
only  
ensures  V01
the  
lifeboats  >>ARG1
are  V01
operational  <ARG2
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
work  V09
if  
needed  V01
,  
but  
makes  V02
the  
crew  >>ARG0
proficient  V01
at  
launching  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
so  <ARG1

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
worry  V02
.  

When  
was  
the  
last  
time  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
heard  V01
about  
a  
ship  >ARG1
sinking  V01
?  

100  
years  
ago  
?  

What  >ARG2
are  V01
some  
fun  
things  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
while  
in  
Japan  <ARGM-TMP
?  

I  >ARG1
'll  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
in  
Okinawa  <ARG2
for  
about  
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
wondering  V01
what  >ARG2
are  V01
some  
fun  
things  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
?  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01
a  
20  
year  
old  
female  >ARG0
travelling  V01
by  
myself  <ARGM-MNR
so  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
anything  <ARG2
.  

Besides  
the  
obvious  
tourist  
spots  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
already  >>ARGM-ADV
have  V01
planned  V01
for  <C-ARG1
.  

How  >ARG2
is  V01
the  
night  
life  <ARG1
in  
Naha  
?  

Are  V02
there  
any  
good  
venues  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
showcase  V01
underground  
bands  <ARG1
,  
or  
just  
a  
venue  
at  
all  
?  

It  >>>ARG1
does  V01
n't  
have  V02
to  
be  V01
underground  V01
it  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
any  
type  <ARG2
of  
music  
.  

Thanks  V01

The  
best  
thing  >>ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
in  
Okinawa  <ARGM-LOC
is  V01
to  
go  V02
to  
a  
beach  <ARG4
.  

Otherwise  >ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
in  
other  
parts  <ARGM-LOC
or  
Japan  
,  
like  
shopping  V01
,  
eating  V01
,  
etc  
.  

Or  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
visit  V01
temples  <ARG1
or  
shrines  
in  
Okinawa  
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
first  >ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
try  V01
speaking  V01
Japanese  <ARG1
.  

Go  V02
to  
a  
sumo  
tournament  <ARG4
.  

Eat  V01
at  
a  
conveyor  
-  
belt  
sushi  
restaurant  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Climb  V01
Mount  
Fuji  <ARG1
.  

Okinawa  >>ARG1
is  V01
quite  >ARGM-EXT
different  V02
from  
the  
rest  <ARG2
of  
Japan  
,  
although  
of  >ARGM-ADV
course  
there  
are  V02
similarities  <ARG1
.  

The  
main  
thing  >>ARG1
people  >ARG0
do  V02
there  <ARGM-LOC
is  V01
go  V02
to  
the  
beach  <ARG4
.  

There  
's  V02
the  
market  >>ARG1
in  
Naha  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
great  V01
.  

You  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
find  V01
all  
sorts  <ARG1
of  
fresh  
food  
and  
get  V01
a  
really  
delicious  
,  
fresh  
sashimi  
/  
sushi  
lunch  <ARG1
upstairs  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Try  V01
the  
local  
sake  <ARG1
too  <ARGM-ADV
if  
you  
can  <ARGM-ADV
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
special  
kind  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
sure  <ARG2
that  
there  
's  V02
much  
nightlife  <ARG1
in  
Naha  <ARGM-LOC
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
more  <ARG2
of  
a  
place  
to  
go  
to  
enjoy  V01
the  
weather  <ARG1
,  
the  
sea  
,  
etc  
.  

You  >>>ARG0
might  
have  V02
to  
make  V01
your  
own  
nightlife  <ARG1
by  
finding  V01
an  
izakaya  <ARG1
(  
pub  
)  
somewhere  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Your  >ARG0
best  >ARGM-ADJ
bet  V01
would  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
be  V01
to  
get  V01
a  
copy  V01
of  
the  
Lonely  
Planet  
Japan  
book  <ARG1
and  
read  V01
the  
chapter  <ARG1
on  
Okinawa  
.

Modern  
m  
16  
vs  
Vietnam  
m  
16  
version  
?  

I  >>ARG0
was  V03
playing  V01
a  
video  
game  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
has  V03
a  
m  
16  
Vietnam  
model  <ARG1
,  
and  
in  
the  
game  >ARGM-LOC
it  >ARG1
's  V01
3  
-  
shot  V01
burst  V02
.  

My  
brother  >ARG0
said  V01
they  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
had  V03
full  
-  
auto  <ARG1
and  
semiautomatic  
during  
Vietnam  <ARGM-TMP
.  

My  
questions  
are  
..  

1  
)  
what  >ARG1
the  
s  V01
difference  V02
between  
a  
modern  
m16  <ARG1
and  
Vietnam  
m  
16  
?  

2  
)  
did  V01
Vietnam  
m  
16's  >>>ARG0
have  V03
a  
3  
-  
shot  V01
burst  V02
function  V01
?  

To  
save  V01
money  <ARG1
Robert  >ARG0
McNamara  
ordered  V01
that  
the  
ammunition  >>>ARG0
for  
the  
new  
M  
-  
16s  >>ARG1
being  V03
sent  V01
to  
SEA  <ARG2
in  
the  
early  
60s  <ARGM-TMP
use  V01
an  
older  
(  
dirtier  
)  
type  >ARG1
of  
gunpowder  
meant  V02
for  
use  V01
with  
the  
M  <ARGM-MNR
-  
14  
.  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
ordered  V01
that  
the  
receiver  >ARG0
not  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
a  
(  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
chrome  <ARG1
)  
coating  V01
that  >>ARG0
helped  V01
keep  V04
the  
gun  <ARG1
from  
jamming  V01
.  

Than  >>>ARGM-TMP
the  
troops  >>>ARG2
being  V03
issued  V01
the  
weapon  <ARG1
were  V03
told  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
self  
-  
cleaning  <ARG2
,  
which  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
was  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
.  

As  
a  
result  >ARGM-ADV
there  
was  V02
a  
problem  <ARG1
with  
the  
weapon  >ARG1
jamming  V01
.  

Once  
the  
troops  >>ARG0
started  V01
cleaning  V01
the  
weapon  <ARG1
properly  <ARGM-MNR
(  
even  
with  
the  
dirtier  
powder  <ARGM-ADV
)  
the  
Vietnam  
era  
M  >>ARG1
-  
16  
turned  V11
out  
to  
be  V01

Planning  V01
on  
going  V02
to  
New

in  
January  <ARGM-TMP

Is  V01
it  <ARG1
OK  <ARG2
to  
holiday  V01
in  
Christchurch  <ARG1
since  
the  
Earthquakes  V01
?  

Are  V03
the  
hotels  >ARG1
back  
up  
and  
running  V01
?  

Are  V02
there  
still  <ARGM-TMP
aftershocks  <ARG1
?  

Planning  V01
on  
going  V02
to  
North  
and  
South  
Island  <ARG4
.  

Is  V01
it  >>ARG0
safe  V01
to  
go  V02
to  
Rotarua  <ARG4
,  
since  
the  
earthquakes  V01
?  

Rotorua  >>ARG1
is  V01
fine  V04
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
assuming  V02
this  >ARG1
was  V01
in  
reference  V01
to  
the  
January  >ARGM-TMP
earthquake  V01
,  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
worry  V02
,  
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
deep  V02
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
nothing  >>ARG1
was  V03
effected  V01
:)  

As  
for  
Christchurch  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
yes  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
aftershocks  >>ARG1
are  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
happening  V01
,  
but  
these  >>ARG1
are  V01
fairly  >ARGM-EXT
small  V01
-  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
feel  V01
them  <ARG1
,  
but  
the  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
do  VLV
any  
damage  V01
.  

Since  
lots  >>ARG0
of  
people  
are  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
living  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
,  
then  >>ARGM-ADV
it  >>>ARG0
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
fine  V04
to  
visit  V01
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
the  
CBD  >ARG1
is  V01
closed  <ARG2
of  
to  
the  
public  
as  
a  
lot  >>>ARG1
of  
it  
is  V01
still  <ARGM-TMP
rubble  <ARG2
and  
stuff  
and  
has  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
been  V03
cleared  V01
away  <ARGM-PRD
yet  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
sure  V02
that  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
find  V01
some  
hotels  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are  V03
running  V01
in  
the  
christchurch  
area  <<<ARGM-LOC
,  
but  
if  
not  >ARGM-ADV
then  >ARGM-ADV
there  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V02
some  <ARG1
in  
close  
by  
towns  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Despite  
the  
aftershocks  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend  V01
going  V02
to  
Christchurch  <ARG4
,  
just  
for  
the  
experience  V01
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
first  
hand  <ARGM-MNR
how  >>ARGM-MNR
things  >>ARG1
get  V03
effected  V01
by

In

stay  V01

what

thanks  V01

louise  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
it  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
depends  V01
on  
your  
riding  
ability  <ARG1
,  
what  
disciplines  >>>ARG1
you  >>>ARG0
are  V01
interested  V01
in  
doing  V02
,  
or  
plan  V01
on  
doing  V02
,  
etc  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
go  V03
for  
the  
base  
number  <ARG1
of  
15  
hh  
.  

It  >>>ARG1
's  V01
"  
tall  V01
"  
being  V01
it  >>ARG1
's  V01
bigger  V01
than  
a  
pony  <ARGM-CXN
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
on  
the  
small  
end  <ARG2
for  
a  
horse  <ARGM-PRD
.  

I  >ARG0
got  V01
my  
horse  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
was  V01
12  <ARG2
and  
I  >ARG1
was  V01
already  <ARGM-ADV
5  <ARG2
'  
9  
-  
5  
'  
10  
,  
thankfully  >ARGM-MNR
I  >>ARG1
stopped  V01
growing  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
hit  V02
5  <ARG1
'  
11  
"  
but  
my  
horse  >ARG1
is  V01
about  
16.2  
or  
16.3  
hh  <ARG2
,  
TB  
.  

So  >>>ARGM-DIS
do  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V01
afraid  V01
to  
get  V01
something  <ARG1
a  
little  
bigger  
than  
"  
perfect  
"  
just  
in  
case  
you  >ARG0
hit  V02
a  
growth  
spurt  <ARG1
.  

A  
taller  
horse  >>ARG1
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
always  >ARGM-TMP
mean  V01
a  
horse  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
handle  V01
.  

Keep  V02
that  <ARG1
in  
mind  <ARG2
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
keep  V01
in  
mind  <ARGM-LOC
whether  
you  >>>ARG0
want  V01
to  
be  V01
able  V01
to  
jump  V05
up  
from  
the  
ground  <ARGM-DIR
,  <<ARG2
if  
you  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
need  V01
to  <ARG1
,  
etc  
.  

You  >>>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
want  V01
to  
be  V01
sure  V01
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
groom  V01
and  
saddle  V01
sufficiently  <ARGM-MNR
and  
the  
horse  >>>ARG1
itself  
is  V01
calm  V03
enough  V01
so  
that  
whatever  
size  >>ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
handle  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

i  >>>ARG1
'm  V01
5  <ARG2
'  
3  
-  
4  
"  
and  
am  V01
21  <ARG2
well  >ARGM-DIS
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
in  
Nov  <ARGM-TMP
and  
my  
horse  >ARG1
is  V01
14.2  
hh  <ARG2
and  
she  >ARG1
's  V01
perfect  
size  <ARG2
for  
me  <ARGM-GOL
i  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
hop  V01
right  
on  <ARGM-ADV
with  
no  
mounting  
block  <ARGM-MNR
.....  
only  
with  
a  
saddle  
though  
haha  
i  
ca  
n't  
bareback  <ARGM-ADV

not

If  
you  >>>ARG1
Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
grow  V01
out  
of  
it  <ARG4

Anything  
smaller  
you  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
grow  V01
out  <ARGM-ADV
,  
anything  >>>ARG1
bigger  
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
too  >>ARGM-EXT
big  V01
and  
difficult  V01
to  
control  V01
and  
manage  V01
,  
especially  
when  >ARGM-TMP

Hope  V01

Where  >ARG2
in  
the  
world  
is  V01
Iguazu  <ARG1
?  

Iguazu  
Falls  

Widely  >ARGM-MNR
considered  V01
to  
be  V01
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
most  
spectacular  
waterfalls  
in  
the  
world  
,  
the  
Iguazu  
Falls  >ARG1
on  
the  
border  
of  
Argentina  
and  
Brazil  
,  
are  V01
a  
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
must  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
attraction  V01
in  
the  
area  <<<ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
centre  >>ARG1
of  
the  
falls  
is  V03
known  V02
locally  <ARGM-LOC
as  
‘  
Garganta  
Del  
Diablo  >ARGM-LOC
’  
(  
The  
Devil  
’s  
Throat  
)  
,  
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
the  
huge  
volume  >ARG0
of  
water  
sends  V02
a  
constant  
mist  <ARG1
of  
spray  
into  
the  
air  <ARGM-DIR
.  

With  
the  
sun  >>ARG0
shinning  V01
down  <ARGM-DIR
on  
the  
spray  <ARG2
,  
creating  V01
a  
rainbow  <ARG1
in  
the  
foreground  <ARGM-LOC
,  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
perfect  
place  >ARGM-LOC
to  
get  V01
that  
trademark  
Iguazu  
Falls  
photograph  <ARG1
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
save  V01
some  <ARG1
of  
your  >ARG0
shots  V03
for  
the  
rest  <<ARG2
of  
the  
falls  
,  
as  
in  
total  >ARGM-ADV
there  
are  V02
around  
270  
cascades  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
spread  V04
out  
over  
nearly  
2  
miles  <ARG2
of  
the  
Iguazu  
River  
.  

The  
Iguazu  
Falls  >>>ARG0
are  V01
easily  >ARGM-ADV
accessible  V02
and  <<ARG2
,  <<ARG2
dependent  V01
on  
your  
time  >ARG1
restrictions  V01
and  
budget  
,  
you  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
get  V05
to  
the  
area  <ARG2
by  
either  
bus  <ARGM-MNR
or  
plane  
.  

The  
nearest  
towns  >ARG1
to  
the  
site  
are  V01
Puerto  <ARG2
Iguazu  
in  
Argentina  
,  
about  
12  
miles  
from  
the  
falls  
,  
and  
Foz  >>ARG1
do  
Iguaçu  
in  
Brazil  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
equally  >ARGM-EXT
close  V10
.  

Both  
towns  >ARG0
have  V03
airports  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are  V03
served  V01
regularly  <ARGM-TMP
from  
the  
larger  
cities  <ARG0
such  
as  
Sao  
Paulo  
,  
Rio  
de  
Janeiro  
and  
Buenos  
Aires  
.  

The  
bus  >ARG1
is  V01
obviously  <ARGM-ADV
the  
cheaper  
option  <ARG2
,  
and  
travelling  V01
up  <ARG1
from  
Buenos  
Aires  <ARG2
the  
trip  V03
is  V01
a  
full  
20  
hours  <ARG2
,  
although  
the  
buses  >ARG1
are  V01
very  
comfortable  <ARG2
with  
spacious  
reclining  V01
seats  <ARG1
.  

The  
bus  >ARGM-MNR
trip  V03
down  <ARG1
from  
Sao  <ARG2
Paulo  
is  V01
a  
similar  
affair  >ARG0
taking  V10
around  
18  
hours  <ARG1
.  

Foz  >>ARG1
on  
the  
Brazilian  >ARG1
side  V01
is  V01
the  
larger  
town  <ARG2
,  
however  >>>ARGM-ADV
both  >>>ARG0
are  V03
geared  V02
up  
to  
cater  V01
for  
visitors  <ARG2
to  
the  
Waterfalls  
and  
National  
Parks  
,  
and  
so  >ARGM-ADV
offer  V01
a  
range  <ARG1
of  
accommodation  V01
for  
all  
budgets  
.  

For  
those  >ARGM-GOL
with  
a  
larger  
appetite  
for  
the  
scenery  
and  
a  
larger  
budget  
,  
there  
are  V02
some  
hotel  
complexes  <ARG1
much  
closer  
to  
the  
action  V02
with  
views  V01
of  
parts  <ARG1
of  
the  
falls

'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
take  V01
her  <ARG1
to  
to  
vet  <ARG3
:(  
please  >ARGM-DIS
help  V01
.  

First  >>ARGM-ADV
of  
all  
,  
I  >>>ARG0
am  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
sorry  V01
to  
hear  V01
you  >>>ARG1
're  V03
having  VLV
this  
issue  V02
with  
your  
cat  <ARG0
.  
:(  

Frequent  >ARGM-TMP
urination  V01
is  V01
a  
sign  V07
of  
several  
things  <ARG1
.  

Bladder  >ARG1
or  
Urinary  
tract  
infections  V01
are  V01
two  
common  
ones  <ARG2
,  
but  
these  >ARG1
usually  >ARGM-ADV
are  V01
frequent  >ARGM-TMP
visits  V01
,  
with  
small  
amounts  >>ARG1
of  
urine  
being  V03
passed  V08
.  

If  
there  
is  V02
blood  <ARG1
in  
the  
urine  <ARGM-LOC
,  
or  
the  
cat  >>ARG1
seems  V01
to  
be  V01
in  
pain  <ARG2
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG1
is  V01
also  <ARGM-DIS
a  
good  
indicator  <ARG2
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
your  
cat  >>ARG0
is  V03
passing  V08
a  
LOT  <ARG1
of  
urine  
,  
and  
this  >>ARG1
is  V01
bad  V07
.  

Given  
the  
chance  V02
your  
cat  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
have  V03
one  
kidney  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
think  V01
the  
worst  
case  
scenario  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
kidney  
disease  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
untreated  >ARGM-ADV
can  >ARGM-MOD
lead  V03
to  
possible  
renal  
failure  <ARG2
.  

Signs  V07
of  
this  <ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
hard  V02
to  
spot  V01
,  
and  
if  
this  >>ARG1
is  V01
true  V01
in  
her  
case  <ARG2
she  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
need  V01
to  
see  V01
a  
vet  <ARG1
.  

Vomiting  V01
,  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
breath  V01
,  
and  
listlessness  
.  

Seizures  V03
will  >ARGM-MOD
occur  V01
when  >>>ARGM-TMP
the  
toxins  >>>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
the  
kidney  >ARG0
normally  >ARGM-ADV
filters  V02
out  <ARGM-DIR
are  V03
released  V01
into  
the  
blood  >ARG1
stream  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
you  >>ARG1
are  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
worried  V01
,  
but  
getting  V05

What  >ARG2
is  V01
Italian  
High  
Renaissance  <ARG1
?  

Have  VLV
a  
look  V01
at  
this  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG0

help  V01
.  

1  
)  
The  
Italian  
Renaissance  >ARG0
began  V01
the  
opening  
phase  <ARG1
of  
the  
Renaissance  
,  
a  
period  >>>ARG0
of  
great  >>ARGM-ADJ
cultural  >>ARG1
change  V01
and  
achievement  V01
in  
Europe  <ARGM-LOC
that  >>>R-ARG0
spanned  V01
the  
period  <ARG1
from  
the  
end  V01
of  
the  
13th  
century  <ARG1
to  
about  
1600  
,  
marking  V01
the  
transition  V01
between  
Medieval  
and  
Early  
Modern  
Europe  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

The  
term  
renaissance  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
essence  <ARGM-ADV
a  
modern  
one  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
came  V01
into  
currency  <ARG2
in  
the  
19th  
century  <ARGM-TMP
,  
in  
the  
work  V01
of  
historians  <ARG0
such  
as  
Jacob  
Burckhardt  
.  

Although  
the  
origins  V01
of  
a  
movement  V07
that  >>R-ARG1
was  V03
confined  V01
largely  <ARGM-ADV
to  
the  
literate  
culture  <ARG2
of  
intellectual  >ARGM-ADJ
endeavor  V01
and  
patronage  V01
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
traced  V02
to  
the  
earlier  
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
14th  
century  
,  
many  
aspects  >ARG1
of  
Italian  
culture  
and  
society  
remained  V01
largely  <ARG3
Medieval  <ARG3
;  
the  
Renaissance  >>ARG1
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
come  V04
into  
full  >ARG2
swing  V03
until  
the  
end  V01
of  
the  
century  <ARG1
.  

The  
word  >ARG1
renaissance  
(  
Rinascimento  
in  
Italian  
)  
means  V01
“  
rebirth  <ARG2
”  
,  
and  
the  
era  >ARG1
is  V01
best  
known  <ARG2
for  
the  
renewed  >ARGM-PRD
interest  V01
in  
the  
culture  <ARG2
of  
classical  
antiquity  
after  
the  
period  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
Renaissance  
humanists  >ARG0
labelled  V01
the  
Dark  
Ages  <ARG2
.  

These  
changes  V01
,  
while  
significant  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
were  V03
concentrated  V01
in  
the  
elite  <ARG1

and  
for  
the  
vast  
majority  >>>ARGM-GOL
of  
the  
population  V01

little  >ARGM-ADV

The

denote  V01
the

the

The

traditionally  >ARGM-ADV
taken  V04

German  <ARGM-MNR
(

in  
the  
early  
nineteenth

its  >ARG1

have  V03
no  
idea  <ARG1
what  >>ARG2
to  
expect  V01
or  
prepare  V02
for  <C-ARG2
and  
calling  V04
in  
to  
get  V01
professional  
advice  <ARG1
from  
either  <ARG2
of  
the  
embassies  
costs  V01
by  
the  
minute  <ARGM-TMP
-  
which  
I  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
the  
money  <ARG1
for  
.  

I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
worried  V01
cause  
I  >>>ARG0
have  V03
no  
idea  >ARG2
who  >R-ARG2
to  
talk  V01
to  <C-ARG2
and  
want  V01
everything  >ARG1
to  
go  V06
smoothly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

An  
American  
passport  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
get  V05
you  <ARG1
right  
into  
the  
country  <ARG2
,  
there  
is  V02
no  >ARGM-NEG
need  V01
for  
a  
VISA  <ARG1

for  
six

There  
is  V02
no  
medical  
exam  <ARG1
or  
blood  >ARG1
test  V01
or  
others  
like  
that  
.  

You  >>>ARG0

not  >ARGM-NEG
need  V01
to  
call  V02
the

Above  >ARG2

the

to  
the  
Department

State  
travel  
website

which  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
you  <ARG2
all  
the  
info  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
you  >ARG0
need  V01
,  
including  
passport  
information  
.  

It  >>ARG1
is  V01
free  V03
.  

I  >ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
stayed  V01
more  
than  
two  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
at  
a  
time  <ARGM-TMP
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
visited  V01
the  
U.K  <ARG1
.  

You  >>ARG2
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
fine  V04
with  
just  
a  
passport  <ARG1
,  
unless  
you  >>ARG1
're  V03
staying  V01
longer  <ARGM-TMP
than  
six  
months  
.  

You  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
double  >ARGM-ADV
check  V01
with  
the  
necessary  
embassy  <ARGM-COM
before  
you  >ARG0
leave  V11
though  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >>ARG0
am  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure  V02
how  
well  >ARGM-MNR
you  >ARG0
planned  V01
this  
trip  V03
.  

You  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
a  
great  
time  <ARG1
,  
so  
no  
worries  
there  
.  

I  >ARG0
visited  V01
London  <ARG1
,  
Edinburgh  
,  
and  
St.  
Andrew  
s  
so  
far  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
I  >>ARG1
was  V03
treated  V01
very  
well  <ARG2
and  
with  
great  
kindness  
.  

Just  >ARGM-ADV
treat  V01
everyone  <ARG1
else  
as  
you  >>>ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
want  V01
to  
be  V03
treated  V01
,  
and  
you  >>ARG1
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
fine  V04
.  

That  
tactic  >ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
failed  V01
me  <ARG3
.  

What  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
get  V01
if  
you  >ARG0
cross  V01
a  
sussex  
male  <ARG1
and  
a  
silkie  
female  
?  

i  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
sussex  
male  <ARG1
and  
a  
pekin  
female  
i  >ARG0
bought  V01
2  
silkies  <ARG1
what  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
the  
sussex  
female  >ARG0
and  
the  
silkie  
females  
would  
make  V01
?  

if  
you  >ARG0
had  V03
any  
pics  <ARG1
of  
your  
hens  
i  >>>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
see  V01
them  <ARG1
to  
compare  V01
them  <ARG1
to  
mine  <ARG2
thanks  V01
?  

A  
Sussex  >>ARG0
crossed  V01
with  
Silkie  <ARGM-COM
would  >ARGM-MOD
make  V01
a  
crossbred  
*  
mutt  
*  
chicken  <ARG1
.  

There  
are  V02
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
genetics  
at  
play  V01
between  
a  
Sussex  <<ARGM-LOC
and  
Silkie  
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
the  
offspring  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
vary  V01
in  
appearance  V01
.  

You  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
say  V01
what  
color  
Silkie  >>ARG2
or  
Sussex  
you  >>ARG0
are  V03
dealing  V01
with  <C-ARG2
so  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
say  V01
what  
color  >>>ARG2
your  
chicks  >>>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
likely  V01
to  
be  V01
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
what  
features  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
/  
could  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
.  

Feather  
Type  
.  

Silkies  >ARG0
have  V03
hookless  
feathers  <ARG1
.  

Sussexs  >ARG0
have  V03
soft  
feathers  <ARG1
.  

All  
offspring  >ARG0
from  
this  
cross  
will  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
soft  
feathers  <ARG1
,  
as  
hookless  
feathers  >ARG1
are  V01
a  
recessive  
gene  <ARG2
.  

Skin  
Color  
:  
Silkies  >ARG0
have  V03
black  
skin  
color  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
dominate  <ARG2
.  

Sussex  >ARG0
have  V03
White  
Skin  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
recessive  <ARG2
or  
dominate  
.  

Either  
way  V01
rec.  
and  
dom.  
white  
genes  >ARG0
dilute  V01
the  
black  
gene  <ARG1
.  

Skin  >>>ARG1
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
darker  V02
but  
lighter  V07
then  
the  
Silkies  <ARGM-CXN
.  

Beards  
/  
Muffs  
:  
If  
your  
Silkie  >ARG0
has  V03
a  
beard  
/  
muff  <ARG1
the  
offspring  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
a  
beard  <ARG1
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
,  
as  
these  
genes  >ARG1
are  V01
incomplete  
dominate  <ARG2
.  

Feathered  
Feet  
/  
Shanks  
-  
Chicks  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
feathered  
feet  
/  
shanks  <ARG1
as  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
also  <ARGM-DIS
incomplete  
dominate  <ARG2
.  

Crest  
:  
Chicks  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
develop  V01
a  
small  
crest  <ARG2
due  
to  
this  >ARG1
being  V01
another  
incomplete  
dominate  
gene  <ARG2
.  

Comb  
Type  
:  
Silkies  >ARG0
have  V03
walnut  
combs  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
actually  <ARGM-ADV
genetically  <ARGM-ADV
two  
comb  
types  <ARG2
(  
Rose  
and  
Pea  
)  
single  >>ARG1
is  V01
also  <ARGM-ADV
there  <ARG2
,  
but  
is  V01
recessive  <ARG2
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
crossed  V01
to  
a  
Sussex  <ARGM-GOL
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
a  
walnut  
,  
pea  
,  
rose  
,  
or  
single  >ARGM-ADJ
combed  V02
bird  <ARG1
.  

Five  
Toes  
:  
Silkies  >ARG0
have  V03
five  
toes  <ARG1
.  

Sussex  >ARG0
have  V03
four  
toes  <ARG1
.  

Crossed  V01
together  <ARGM-ADV
(  
five  
toes  >ARG1
is  V01
incompletely  
dominate  <ARG2
)  
chicks  >>ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
develop  V01
to  
have  V03
an  
fifth  
toe  <ARG1
on  
both  
,  
or  
even  
one  
foot  
.  

Silkie  
crosses  >ARG1
are  V01
great  
birds  <ARG2
,  
and  
very  
neat  
looking  
.  

Hens  >ARG1
make  V06
excellent  
mothers  <ARG2
as  
they  >>>ARG1
are  V01
bigger  V01
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
better  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
are  V01
smarter  V06
the  
Silkies  <ARGM-CXN
.  

Best  >ARGM-ADJ
wishes  V01

.  

What  >>ARG1
do  V01
you  >ARG0
think  V01
of  
these  
photos  V01
?  

The  
lighting  >ARG1
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
best  <ARG2
,  
but  
the  
pics  >ARG1
turned  V11
out  
ok  <ARG2
in  
my  
opinion  <ARGM-ADV
.  

deleting  V01
a  
question  >>ARGM-ADV
where  >>R-ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
like  V01
the

wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
you  <ARG4
better  >ARGM-ADJ
answers  V01
...  
i  >ARG0
refer  V03
to  
my  >ARG0
previous  >ARGM-TMP
answer  V01
:  

you  >>>ARG0
need  V01
to  
learn  V01
about  
white  
balance  <ARG1
,  
composition  V02
,  
angle  
,  
and  
work  V01
on  
using  V01
the  
camera  <ARG1
properly  <ARGM-MNR
...  

[  
edit  
-  
and  
she  >>ARG2
most  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
new  V02
to  
modeling  V02
,  
because  
she  >>>ARG0
does  V01
look  V02
unsure  V01
of  
her  
poses  <ARG1
)  

lol  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >>ARG0
has  V01
posted  V01
this  <ARG1
so  
many  
times  <ARGM-TMP
today  <ARGM-TMP
already  <ARGM-TMP
.  

clearly  >>ARGM-ADV
he  >>ARG1
s  V01
mad  V04
that  
people  >ARG0
know  V01
he  >ARG0
took  V01
her  
pic  <ARG1
off  
the  
net  <ARG3
and  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
NOT  <ARGM-NEG
his  
gf  <ARG2

Not  
bad  
,  
but  
too  
many  
distracting  
elements  
for  
my  >ARG0
taste  V01
.  

For  
example  
:  

In  
the  
photo  V01
on  
the  
couch  <ARGM-LOC
,  
the  
pillow  >>>ARG0
she  >>ARG1
is  V03
resting  V01
on  <C-ARGM-LOC
clashes  V01
with  
everything  <ARG1
else  
in  
the  
shot  V03
.  

There  
are  V02
also  <ARGM-ADV
some  
distracting  
background  
elements  <ARG1
like  
the  
light  
fixture  
and  
what  >ARG0
looks  V02
like  
a  
door  
handle  <ARG1
on  
the  
left  
.  

In  
the  
standing  >ARGM-ADJ
photo  V01
(  
from  
the  
front  <ARGM-DIR
)  
there  
is  V02
a  
corner  >ARG0
of  
a  
rug  
creeping  V01
in  <ARG1
,  
some  
kind  
of  
box  
in  
the  
lower  
right  
corner  
and  
what  >ARG0
looks  V02
like  
a  
power  
cord  <ARG1
.  

In  
the  
shot  V03
from  
the  
back  <ARG1
,  
the  
crumpled  V01
bottom  >>ARG1
of  
the  
curtain  
is  V01
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
noticeable  V02
as  
well  
as  
the  
power  
outlet  <C-ARG1
.  

Compositionally  >ARGM-PRD
,  
this  
one  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
my  
favorite  <ARG2
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
suggest  V01
trying  V01
a  
different  
crop  <ARG1
because  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
cutting  V04
her  <ARG1
off  <C-V
at  
the  
calf  <ARGM-LOC
looks  V02
great  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
like  V01
the  
shadow  <ARG1
,  
though  <ARGM-ADV
.  

My  >ARG0
suggestion  V01
is  V01
to  
pay  VLV
close  >ARGM-ADJ
attention  V02
to  
what  >>ARG1
's  V03
going  V15
on  
in  
the  
background  <ARGM-LOC
and  
if  
possible  >ARGM-ADV
,  
stand  V01
on  
a  
chair  <ARG2
,  
get  V05
on  
the  
ground  <ARG2
,  
do  V02
whatever  >>ARG1
you  >>>ARG0
need  V01
to  
do  V02
to  
get  V04
rid  V01
of  
distracting  
elements  <ARG1
.  

Using  V01
a  
fairly  
wide  
aperture  <ARG1
is  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
helpful  V04
in  
blurring  V01
out  <ARGM-PRD
unwanted  
background  
elements  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
've  V01
had  V03
a  
few  >ARGM-ADJ
great  >ARGM-ADJ
shots  V03
ruined  V01
myself  <ARGM-REC
because  
there  
was  V02
something  >>ARG1
in  
the  
background  
I  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
notice  V01
at  
first  <ARGM-TMP
.  

what  >ARG2
are  V01
some  
unique  
customs  <ARG1
in  
ireland  
?  

As  
far  >>>ARGM-ADV
ask  
I  >>ARG0
’m  V01
aware  V01
our  
most  
unique  
custom  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
the  
“  
Country  
Wake  <ARG2
”  
.  

In  
all  
my  >ARG0
travels  V01
I  >>>ARG1
’ve  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
seen  V01
anything  <ARG1
like  
it  
and  
am  V03
often  >ARGM-TMP
met  V05
with  
an  
odd  >ARGM-ADJ
look  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
explain  V01
them  <ARG1
to  
foreigners  <ARG2
.  

After  
a  
person  >ARG1
dies  V01
,  
their  
remains  >>ARG1
are  V03
“  
waked  V04
”  
in  
their  
home  <ARGM-LOC
for  
roughly  
2  
-  
3  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

In  
this  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
visitors  >>>ARG0
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
come  V01
to  
the  
house  <ARG4
,  
pay  VLV
their  >C-ARG0
respects  V01
to  
the  
desisted  <ARG2
and  
their  
family  
and  
have  V03
a  
couple  <ARG1
of  
cups  
of  
tea  
with  
a  
sandwich  
or  
a  
bun  
.  

The  
wake  >ARG2
also  >ARGM-DIS
included  V01
the  
night  
sit  <ARG1
were  >ARGM-ADV
friends  >ARG1
and  
family  
sit  V03
up  
through  
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
with  
the  
remains  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Wakes  >>ARG1
are  V01
common  V01
both  
north  <ARGM-LOC
and  
south  
of  
the  
boarder  
with  
Protestants  <ARG2
and  
Catholics  
alike  
.  

But  
only  
really  
in  
the  
countryside  
.  

The  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
notable  >ARGM-ADJ
difference  V02
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
noticed  V01
is  V01
that  
in  
the  
south  >>ARGM-LOC
of  
Ireland  
one  
night  >>ARG1
of  
the  
wake  
is  V03
often  >ARGM-TMP
held  V04
in  
the  
chapel  <ARGM-LOC
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
before  
the  
funeral  
,  
this  
tradition  >ARG1
started  V01
after  
the  
civil  >ARGM-ADJ
war  V01
.  

Another  
unique  
custom  >ARG1
(  
and  
a  
dying  
one  
at  
that  
)  
is  V01
the  
Pioneers  <ARG2
.  

The  
Pioneers  >ARG1
was  V01
an  
organization  >>>ARG0
started  V01
at  
the  
end  V01
of  
the  
19th  
century  <ARG1
which  >>R-ARG0
pushed  V01
and  
supported  V01
the  
ideal  <ARG1
of  
temperance  
(  
abstaining  V01
from  
alcohol  <ARG1
)  
,  
in  
an  
attempt  V01
to  
deal  V01
with  
the  
massive  >ARGM-EXT
issue  V02
of

animals  >ARG0
see  V01
images  <ARG1
on  
a  
TV  
screen  <ARGM-LOC
like  
humans  
do  V01
?  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
unsure  V01
of  
this  <ARG1
,  
because  
once  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
watched  V01
a  
commercial  <ARG1
of  
cat  
food  
with  
my  
cat  <ARGM-COM
and  
she  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
react  V01
to  
seeing  V01
another  
cat  <ARG1
on  
TV  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
heard  V01
that  
a  
company  >>>ARG0
(  
here  >ARG2
is  V01
a  
link  <ARG1
:  
http://news.yahoo.com/nestl-purina-releases-commercial-aimed-dogs-183443091.html  
)  
is  V03
trying  V01
to  
make  V01
a  
dog  
food  
commercial  >ARG1
aimed  V02
at  
dogs  <ARG2
,  
complete  <ARGM-ADV
with  
squeaky  >ARG3
chew  
-  
toy  >ARG1
sounds  V02
,  
and  
high  
pitched  >ARG3
sounds  V02
that  >R-ARG1
humans  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hear  V01
.  

As  
far  >>ARGM-ADV
as  
I  >ARG0
understand  V01
,  
this  
ad  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get  V04
dogs  >ARG1
excited  V01
,  
but  
my  
question  >ARG1
is  V01
:  
Can  >ARGM-MOD
dogs  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
see  V01
the  
images  >ARG1
featured  V01
in  
the  
advert  <ARG2
like  
humans  <<ARGM-MNR
?  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
animals  >ARG0
remember  V01
images  <ARG1
on  
TV  
like  
us  <ARGM-MNR
,  
humans  
?  

If  
so  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
then  >>ARGM-ADV
does  V01
that  >ARG1
mean  V01
that  
if  
you  >ARG0
watched  V01
a  
scary  
movie  <ARG1
and  
your  
dog  >ARG1
/  
cat  
/  
parrot  
was  V01
in  
the  
same  
room  <ARG2
as  
you  
they  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
also  >>ARGM-DIS
get  V03
scared  V01
?  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
--  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
particularly  >ARGM-ADV
like  V01
scary  
movies  <ARG1
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tried  V01
this  <ARG1
with  
my  
pet  <ARGM-COM
.  

Although  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
that  
scary  
movies  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
affect  V01
pets  <ARG1
for  
a  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
;  
I  >>ARG0
am  V01
sure  V02
they  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
forget  V01
sometime  <ARGM-TMP
--  
or  
am  V01
I  >ARG1
wrong  V04
?  

So  
what  
about  
T.V.  
?  

Do  V01
dogs  >ARG0
enjoy  V01
watching  V01
T.V.  <ARG1
?  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
T.V.  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
series  >>ARG1
of  
flickering  
pictures  
that  >>R-ARG1
are  V03
streamed  V03
together  <ARGM-PRD
to  
make  V01
a  
moving  
picture  <ARG1
.  

The  
pictures  >>ARG1
are  V03
broadcast  V01
at  
a  
rate  <ARGM-MNR
of  
about  
60  
Hz  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
how  
fast  >>ARGM-MNR
they  >>ARG1
need  V01
to  
move  V01
for  
us  >ARG0
to  
see  V01
them  <ARG1
as  
a  
moving  
,  
flawless  
picture  <ARG2
.  

To  
a  
dog  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
watching  V01
T.V.  <ARG1
is  V01
a  
lot  
like  
watching  V01
and  
old  
scratchy  
silent  
film  <ARG1
because  
their  >ARG1
flicker  >ARG1
fusion  V01
seems  V01
to  
occur  V01
at  
a  
rate  <ARGM-MNR
of  
70  
to  
80  
Hz  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG0
see  V01
the  
pictures  >ARG1
flicker  V01
slower  <ARGM-MNR
and  
there  
for  >ARGM-DIS
it  
seems  V01
choppy  <ARG1
to  
them  <ARG2
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
chances  V02
are  V01
that  
if  
your  
dog  >>ARG0
likes  V02
to  
watch  V01
T.V.  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG1
’s  V01
probably  <ARGM-ADV
because  
of  
the  
sounds  V02
.  

Hearing  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
dog  >ARG0
’s  
secondary  >ARGM-ADJ
sense  V01
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
discuss  V01
that  <ARG1
in  
another  
blog  
entery  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG0
do  V02
.  

i  >>ARG0
m  V01
pretty  >ARGM-ADV
sure  V02
that  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
see  V01
things  <ARG1
on  
the  
tv  
screen  <ARGM-LOC
because  
my  
cat  >ARG0
chases  V01
things  <ARG1
around  
the  
tv  
screen  <ARGM-DIR

How  
much  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
I  >>ARG0
be  V03
looking  V01
at  <C-ARG1
for  
horse  >ARG1
transportation  V01
?  

I  >ARG0
need  V01
one  
horse  >ARG1
transported  V01
to  
shows  V04
throughout  
the  
2012  >ARGM-TMP
show  V04
season  <<<ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
the  
location  >ARG1
is  V01
about  
3  
hours  
away  <ARG2
from  
where  >ARGM-LOC
I  >ARG0
live  V01
.  

The  
place  >>>ARG0
where  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARGA
'm  V03
boarding  V02
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
likely  V01
to  
want  V01
to  
take  V01
me  <ARG1
this  
far  <ARG3
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
any  
ways  V01
of  
hauling  V01
him  <ARG1
myself  <ARGM-REC
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
hire  V01
someone  >ARG0
(  
or  
multiple  
people  
)  
to  
transport  V01
me  <ARG1
to  
these  
shows  V04
.  

If  
they  >ARG0
ask  V01
how  
much  >>>ARG1
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V01
willing  V02
to  
pay  V01
,  
what  >ARG2
is  V01
a  
good  
price  
range  <ARG1
?  

I  >ARG0
saw  V01
a  
site  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
charges  V01
$  <ARG1
0.70  
per  
mile  
.  

Is  V01
that  >ARG1
reasonable  V02
?  

Impossible  
to  
say  V01
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
guess  V01
you  >>>ARG0
would  
have  V02
to  
work  V05
out  
fuel  >ARG1
consumption  V01
for  
the  
particular  
vehicle  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
using  V01
and  
pay  V01
a  
proportion  <ARG1
of  
that  
,  
and  
some  
on  
top  
for  
the  
driver  >ARG0
's  
time  <ARG3
and  
effort  V01
,  
unless  
you  >>>ARG0
are  V01
able  V01
to  
share  V01
transport  V01
with  
another  <<ARG2
or  
more  
,  
that  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
keep  V02
the  
costs  <ARG1
down  <ARG2
.  

Remember  V01
that  
you  >ARG0
get  V01
what  >ARG3
you  >ARG0
pay  V01
for  <C-ARG3
.  

Three  
hours  >>ARG1
is  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
far  V01
,  
but  
you  >>ARG0
are  V03
doing  V02
multiple  >ARGM-ADJ
shows  V04
.  

Some  
people  >>>ARG0
are  V01
willing  V02
to  
take  V01
your  
horse  <ARG1
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
have  V03
old  
trailers  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
are  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
safest  <ARG2
in  
the  
world  
.  

Rusted  V01
,  
torn  
corners  >ARG0
in  
the  
stalls  
,  
unhealthy  
air  
,  
straight  
load  
instead  
of  
slant  
load  
can  >ARGM-MOD
all  
make  V02
travelling  >>ARG0
hard  V02
,  
if  
not  
downright  >ARGM-ADV
dangerous  V01
,  
on  
your  
horse  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
had  V04
my  
horse  >ARG1
transported  V01
from  
CA  <ARG2
to  
WA  <ARG3
and  
he  >ARG1
came  V01
on  
this  
big  
,  
open  
stock  
trailer  <ARGM-MNR
.  

He  >>>ARG0
was  V01
dehydrated  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG1
got  V05
there  <ARG2
and  
lost  V02
weight  <ARG1
.  

Since  
then  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
use  V01
a  
professional  >>ARGM-ADJ
horse  >ARG1
hauling  V01
service  V01
with  
people  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
ride  V01
with  
my  
horse  <ARGM-COM
to  
keep  V02
an  
eye  <ARG1
on  
him  <ARG2
,  
stop  V01
every  
few  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
for  
water  <ARGM-PRP
,  
and  
their  
trailers  >ARG0
all  
have  V03
super  
smooth  >ARGM-ADJ
suspension  V02
.  

All  
horses  >>>ARG2
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
had  V04
delivered  V01
to  
me  <ARG2
since  
then  <ARGM-TMP
are  V01
happy  V01
and  
healthy  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG1
arrive  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
call  V02
Bob  <ARG1
Hubbard  
Transport  
and  
get  V01
a  
quote  V01
.  

Even  
though  
you  >>ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
use  V01
them  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
you  <ARG2
some  
idea  <ARG1
of  
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
cost  V01
and  
what  >>ARG1
is  V01
fair  V01
.  

See  V01
link  <ARG1
below  
.  

Make  V02
sure  V01
the  
trailer  >ARG1
service  V01
you  >ARG0
use  V01
is  V03
bonded  V02
/  
insured  V02
and  
knows  V01
something  <ARG1
about  
first  >ARGM-ADJ
aid  V01
.  

Do  V01
they  >ARG0
have  V03
this  <ARG1
anywhere  <ARGM-LOC
?  

I  >>>ARG0
want  V01
to  
take  VLV
a  
cruise  V01
around  
the  
world  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >ARG0
mean  V01
literally  <ARGM-ADV
around  
the  
world  <ARG2
if  
possible  <ARGM-ADV
.  

First  
of  
if  
i  >ARG0
went  V02
alone  <ARGM-MNR
on  
a  
regular  
cabin  <ARGM-LOC
how  
much  >>ARG2
would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
estimate  V01
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
a  
guess  V01
.  

Second  >ARGM-DIS
is  V02
there  
any  
way  V01
to  
sort  
of  >ARGM-ADV
customize  V01
the  
places  >>ARG4
you  >>ARG0
wan  V01
na  
go  V02
to  <C-ARG4
?  

Like  >ARGM-DIS
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
pick  V01
the  
destinations  <ARG1
?  

But  
if  
not  >ARGM-ADV
just  >ARGM-ADV
say  V01
no  <ARG1
but  
i  >ARG0
hope  V01
there  
is  V02
like  <ARGM-DIS
one  <ARG1
out  
there  
somewhere  
.

.  
Here  >ARG2

lists  V01
world

.  

http://www.cruisecompete.com/specials/regions/world/1  

Prices  V01
listed  V01
,  
however  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
are  V03
usually  >ARGM-ADV
based  V02
on  
two  
people  <ARG2
in  
a  
cabin  
,  
and  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
likely  >ARGM-ADV
face  V01
some  
high  
"  
single

"  
costs  <ARG1
in  
addition  V02
.  

(  
Two  
people  >ARG0
in  
a  
cabin  
will  >ARGM-MOD
spend  V01
more  <ARG3
onboard  <ARGM-LOC

so  >ARGM-ADV
cruise  
lines  >ARG0
charge  V01
you  >ARG0
more  <ARG1
to  
sail  V01
alone  <ARGM-MNR
.  

You  >>>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
do  V02
better  <ARGM-MNR
on  
the

you  >ARG0
request  V01
competitive  >ARGM-ADJ
quotes  V01
via

2  
.  
Short  V06
of  
chartering  V01
your  
own

crew  
,  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01

days  
in  
duration  
.  

Travelling  V01
on  
your  
own  <ARGM-MNR
you  >>ARG0
would  
have  V02
to  
pay  V01
double  <ARG1

cabins  >>ARG1

sold  V01

Was  
the  
San  
Francisco  
Bay  
Area  
mostly  
Caucasian  
back  
in  
the  
early  
1970s  
?  

No  
.  

There  
has  V01
been  V02
a  
large  
Asian  
presence  <ARG1
in  
the  
SF  
Bay  
Area  <ARGM-LOC
for  
a  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
--  
the  
Chinatown  >ARG1
here  
was  V01
the  
largest  >ARGM-ADJ
population  V01
of  
chinese  <ARG2
outside  <ARG1
of  
China  
,  
there  
were  V02
lots  <ARG1
of  
Japanese  >>>ARG1
who  >>>R-ARG1
'd  V01
been  V03
displaced  V01
during  
WWII  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
whole  
Western  
Addition  >>ARG1
and  
a  
large  
portion  
of  
the  
Haight  
was  V01
black  V05
.  

The  
Mission  >ARG1
was  V01
basically  <ARGM-ADV
latin  
-  
american  <ARG2
.  

As  
the  
southeast  
asians  >ARG1
and  
philipinos  
came  V01
over  <ARGM-DIR
,  
they  >ARG0
added  V02
to  
the  
cultures  <ARG2
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
Bay  
Area  >>ARG1
has  V01
been  V01
fairly  
mixed  <ARG2
ethnically  <ARGM-MNR
for  
a  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
--  
caucasians  >>>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
seemed  V01
to  
be  V01
a  
large  
populous  <ARG2
but  
that  >ARG1
's  V01
because  
most  
tourists  >ARG1
back  
then  >ARGM-TMP
were  V01
caucasian  <ARG2
and  
many  >ARG1
of  
the  
hippies  
were  V01
caucasians  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG1
's  V01
who  
the  
photographers  >ARG0
took  V01
pictures  <ARG1
of  <ARG1
.  

The  
other  
ethicities  >>ARG1
were  V03
n't  >ARGM-NEG
well  >ARGM-MNR
represented  V01
in  
politics  <ARG2
yet  <ARGM-TMP
--  
or  
rather  
,  
they  >>ARG0
were  V03
just  >ARGM-ADV
breaking  V01
the  
color  
barrier  <ARG1
in  
the  
70's  <ARGM-TMP
due  
largely  
to  
the  
more  
open  
-  
minded  
hippy  
generation  <ARGM-CAU
.  

Marin  
County  >ARG1
was  V01
predominantly  
caucasian  <ARG2
and  
many  >ARG0
of  
the  
expanding  
outer  
east  
bay  
areas  
started  V05
out  
as  
white  
suburbs  <ARG2
.  

It  
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
so  
long  
after  
Civil  >ARG2
Rights  V05
laws  >>>ARG0
against  
discrimination  V02
started  V01
to  
have  VLV
an  
impact  V01
.  

You  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
saw  V01
black  
MUNI  
drivers  <ARG1
,  
Asian  
police  
,  
Latino  
politicians  
until  
then  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
an  
evolution  V01
.  

Many  
illegals  >>ARG1
were  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
counted  V02
in  
the  
population  V01
until  
the  
mid-80s  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
big  
percent  <ARG1
of  
Chinese  >ARG0
migration  V01
until  
the  
mid  
90s  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >ARG0
had  V03
fewer  
people  >ARG0
running  V02
across  
the  
Mexican  
border  <ARGM-DIR
then  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>ARG1
had  V03
fewer  >ARGM-ADJ
social  >ARGM-ADJ
benefits  V01
at  
that  
time  <ARGM-TMP
for  
people  <ARGM-GOL
so  >>ARGM-ADV
many  
immigrants  >>ARG1
were  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
counted  V02
.  

Only  
Caucasians  >>ARG0
had  V03
any  
political  
power  <ARG1
,  
corporate  
presence  
or  
owned  V01
businesses  <ARG1
except  
for  
Mom  
and  
Pop  
stores  <ARGM-ADV
in  
some  
neighborhoods  
.  

San  >>ARG1
Francisco  
was  V03
settled  V03
in  
the  
19th  
and  
20th  
century  <ARGM-TMP
by  
mainly  
European  
immigrants  <ARG0
except  
for  
some  
Asian  
workers  >ARG1
who  >R-ARG1
were  V01
manual  
laborers  <ARG2
.  

There  
has  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
been  V02
a  
Mexican  
-  
American  >ARG0
cultural  >ARG1
influence  V01
since  
Calif  >>ARG1
was  V03
owned  V01
by  
Mexico  <ARG0
.  

We  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
larger  >ARGM-CXN
black  >ARG2
population  V01
in  
the  
70s  <<ARGM-TMP
than  
we  >ARG0
have  V03
now  <ARGM-TMP
but  
they  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
any  
power  <ARG1
until  
Willie  >>ARG1
Brown  
was  V03
elected  V01
.  

San  >ARG1
Francisco  
was  V01
always  <ARGM-TMP
progressive  <ARG2
and  
welcoming  
and  
tolerant  
to  
all  
kinds  
of  
people  
historically  <ARGM-ADV
.  

The  
counties  >>ARG1
outside  
San  
Francisco  
were  V01
more  >ARGM-CXN
white  V02
than  
San  <C-ARGM-CXN
Francisco  
in  
the  
70s  <ARGM-TMP
.  

EDIT  
:  
My  
memory  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V01
good  V03
so  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
a  
more  
accurate  >ARGM-ADJ
answer  V01
from  
someone  >ARG0
else  
who  >R-ARG0
remembers  V01
the  
time  <ARG1
.  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
rabbits  >ARG0
and  
chickens  
live  V01
together  <ARGM-COM
?  

I  >>>ARG0
am  V03
thinking  V01
about  
getting  V01
a  
rabbit  <ARG1
as  
a  
pet  <ARGM-PRD
,  
but  
my  
parents  >ARG0
said  V01
that  
it  >>ARG1
has  V02
to  
stay  V01
outside  <ARG3
.  

We  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
own  V01
two  
chickens  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are  V03
kept  V01
in  
a  
run  <ARGM-LOC
behind  
out  
garage  
/  
barn  
thing  
.  

There  
is  V02
already  <ARGM-TMP
a  
little  
dog  
house  >>>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
turn  V02
into  
a  
little  
rabbit  
hutch  <ARG2
being  V03
kept  V01
back  
there  <ARGM-LOC
and  
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
thinking  V01
about  
keeping  V01
the  
rabbit  <ARG1
in  
the  
run  <ARGM-LOC
with  
the  
chickens  <ARGM-COM
,  
but  
keeping  V01
the  
chickens  <ARG1
in  
the  
coop  <ARGM-LOC
and  
the  
rabbit  
in  
the  
hutch  
at  
night  
.  

However  >ARGM-ADV
,  
in  
the  
day  
time  >ARGM-TMP
would  >ARGM-MOD
it  
be  V01
okay  <ARG2
for  
the  
rabbit  >ARG0
to  
hop  V01
around  <ARGM-PRD
along  
with  
the  
chickens  <ARGM-COM
?  

We  >ARG0
feed  V01
the  
chickens  <ARG2
scraps  <ARG1
of  
veggies  
and  
fruits  
throughout  
the  
day  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
nothing  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
a  
rabbit  >>>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V01
able  V01
to  
digest  V01
just  
fine  <ARGM-MNR
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
rabbits  >ARG0
and  
chickens  
live  V01
together  <ARGM-ADV
as  
long  <ARGM-TMP
as  
they  >ARG0
have  V03
separate  
places  <ARG1
for  
their  
food  
and  
water  
?  

(  
The  
rabbit  
hutch  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
an  
opening  V01
only  
big  <ARGM-ADJ
enough  
for  
the  
rabbit  
,  
the  
chickens  >>>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V01
able  V01
to  
get  V05
to  
the  
rabbit  
food  <ARG2
)  
Also  >ARGM-DIS
,  
is  V01
it  <ARG1
okay  <ARG2
if  
the  
rabbit  >ARG0
occasionally  >ARGM-TMP
sneaks  V02
a  
few  
bites  V01
of  
chicken  
feed  <ARG1
?  

My  
last  
rabbit  >ARG0
did  V02
that  <ARG1
a  
few  
times  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
he  >>ARG1
was  V01
fine  V04
...  

I  >>>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
wan  V01
na  
make  V02
sure  V01
:)  
Thank  
!  

Yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
but  >ARGM-DIS
be  V01
sure  V01
that  
your  
chickens  >ARG1
are  V01
all  <ARGM-ADV
hens  <ARG2
(  
I  >ARG0
mean  V01
not  
roosters  <ARG2
)  
,  
Roosters  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
attack  V01
rabbits  <ARG1
or  
anything  >>ARG1
they  >ARG0
see  V01
moving  V01
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V01
aware  V01
of  
that  <ARG1
,  
hens  >>ARG1
are  V01
friendly  V01
with  
almost  
all  
kinds  <ARG2
of  
pets  
!  

From  
my  >ARG0
experience  V01
Hens  >>ARG1
(  
Not  
roosters  
)  
are  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
friendly  V01
with  
duck  <ARG2
,  
Guinea  
pigs  
,  
kittens  
,  
cows  
,  
Rabbits  
,  
etc  
.  

Be  V01
sure  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
feed  V01
your  
rabbits  <ARG2
non-veg  
items  <ARG1
!  

You  >ARG0
said  V01
they  >ARG0
live  V01
in  
different  
cages  <ARGM-LOC
and  
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
free  V04
in  
day  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
no  
problem  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
put  V01
both  <ARG1
of  
them  
in  
one  
cage  <ARG2
because  
rabbits  >ARG1
bedding  V02
is  V01
different  V02
than  
that  <ARG2
of  
hens  
,  
wet  >ARGM-ADJ
bedding  V02
can  >ARGM-MOD
cause  V01
diseases  <ARG1
in  
them  <ARGM-LOC
!  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
put  V01
both  <ARG1
of  
them  
in  
one  
cage  <ARG2
.  

Good  
luck  
!  

yea  >ARGM-DIS
i  >ARG0
guess  V01
but  
rabbits  >ARG0
a  >ARGM-MOD
easily  >ARGM-ADV
escape  V01
a  
pen  <ARG1
or  
another  
rabbit  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
get  V05
in  
there  <ARG2
and  
that  
rabbit  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
the  
opposite  
gender  <ARG2
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
be  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
careful  V04
and  
some  
feeds  >>>ARG0
could  >>>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
toxic  V01
to  
rabbits  <ARG1
and  
safe  V01
for  
chickens  <ARG1
.  

Rabbits  >>ARG0
do  V01
burrow  V01
also  <ARGM-ADV
so  >>>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V01
surprised  V01
if  
chicken  >>ARG1
are  V03
falling  V01
into  
holes  <ARG4
.  

rabbits  >>ARG0
are  V01
delicate  <ARG2
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
diseases  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-DIS
watch  V02
out  
for  
that  <ARG1
.  

melting  V01
brass  <ARG1
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
work  V09
?  

my  
friends  >>>ARG0
and  
I  
are  V03
trying  V01
to  
melt  V01
bras  <ARG1
to  
make  V01
some  
little  
figures  <ARG1
.  

we  >>ARG0
have  V01
made  V01
a  
furnace  <ARG1
as  
such  <ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >>>ARG0
took  V01
a  
clay  
flower  
pot  <ARG1
with  
a  
hole  
in  
the  
bottom  
put  V01
a  
piece  <ARG1
of  
steel  
pipe  
in  
the  
middle  <ARG2
of  
it  
with  
a  
cap  <ARGM-MNR
on  
the  
bottom  
,  
filled  V01
the  
pipe  <ARG1
with  
brass  
scrap  <ARG2
,  
surounded  V01
the  
pipe  <ARG2
with  
charcoal  <ARG1
lit  V04
it  <ARG1
off  <ARGM-PRD
and  
pumped  V01
air  <ARG2
through  
the  
hole  <ARG1
in  
the  
pot  
,  
everything  >>>ARG1
got  V03
red  >ARGM-PRD
hot  V05
but  
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
melt  V01
.  

what  >>ARG1
am  V03
I  >ARG0
doing  V02
wrong  <ARGM-MNR

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend  V01
to  
start  V01
with  
something  <ARG2
more  
simple  
like  
tin  
,  
pewter  
,  
aluminum  
or  
zinc  
,  
they  >ARG0
all  
have  V03
a  
much  
more  
reasonable  
melting  
point  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
echo  V01
both  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
answers  V01
.  

Molten  
brass  >>ARG1
is  V01
damn  >ARGM-ADV
hot  V05
and  
usually  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
's  V01
pressurized  V01
gas  <ARG1
and  
forced  V02
air  <ARG1
or  
oxygen  
.  

Even  
if  
you  >>ARG0
did  V01
melt  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
doubt  V01
you  >ARG0
foresaw  V01
the  
issues  V02
of  
handling  V01
it  <ARG1
and  
pouring  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
's  V01
really  >ARGM-ADV
too  >ARGM-EXT
advanced  V02
for  
a  
beginner  <ARGM-GOL
,  
both  
in  
tooling  <ARG2
and  
safety  
.  

Just  >ARGM-ADV
the  
zinc  
fumes  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
you  <ARG1
,  
if  
you  
do  V01
n't  
take  VLV
precautions  V01
.  

Pewter  >>ARG1
is  V01
perfect  V02
for  
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
are  V03
doing  V02
,  
and  
it  >ARG1
melts  V01
on  
a  
stove  
top  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend  V01
to  
start  V01
with  
something  <ARG2
more  
simple  
like  
tin  
,  
pewter  
,  
aluminum  
or  
zinc  
,  
they  >ARG0
all  
have  V03
a  
much  
more  
reasonable  
melting  
point  <ARG1
.  

Brass  >ARG0
has  V03
an  
even  
higher  
melting  
point  <ARG1
than  
bronze  
and  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
think  V01
your  
charcoal  >>>ARG1
just  >>>ARGM-ADV
does  V01
n't  >>>ARGM-NEG
get  V03
hot  V05
enough  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
bet  V01
you  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-ADV
did  V01
take  V01
charcoal  >>>ARG1
as  
it  >>ARG1
is  V03
used  V01
for  
barbecue  <ARG2
which  >>>R-ARG1
does  V01
not  >>ARGM-NEG
get  V03
as  >ARGM-CXN
hot  V05
as  
real  
coal  <C-ARGM-CXN
(  
e.g.  >>ARGM-ADV
for  
blacksmithing  V01
one  >ARG0
needs  V01
coal  <ARG1
,  
not  
barbecue  
charcoal  
)  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
done  V02
a  
fair  
amount  <ARG1
of  
metal  >ARG2
casting  V03
,  
but  
never  >ARGM-NEG
tried  V01
to  
build  V01
my  
own  
furnace  <ARG1
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
your  
version  >>>ARG1
is  V01
just  >ARGM-DIS
too  >ARGM-EXT
small  V01
and  
does  V01
n't  >>>ARGM-NEG
get  V03
hot  V05
enough  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
melted  V01
small  
amounts  <ARG1
of  
bronze  
in  
a  
crucible  <ARGM-LOC
with  
a  
large  
propane  
torch  <ARGM-MNR
(  
much  
larger  
than  
the  
plumbers  
torch  
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
run  V01
of  
those  
propane  
cylinders  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
buy  V01
for  
a  
gas  
grill  <ARGM-PRP
)  
.  

I  >>ARG0
melt  V01
brass  <ARG1
and  
cast  V03
it  <ARG2
http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm  

Brass  >ARG1
melts  V01
at  
just  
under  
2000  
F  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
a  
bright  
yellow  
heat  <ARG2
,  
not  
red  
hot  
.

You  >>>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
make  V02
a  
version  >ARG1
of  
your  
setup  
work  V09
,  
but  
it  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
take  V10
quite  
a  
bit  <ARG1
of  
charcoal  
and  
a  
lot  
of  
forced  V02
air  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
use  V01
propane  <ARG1
with  
a  
blower  <ARGM-MNR
and  
a  
burner  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
built  V01
http://www.mikegigi.com/meltmetl.htm  
and  
http://www.mikegigi.com/firehole.htm  

Should  >ARGM-MOD
all  
UK  
towns  >ARG0
and  
their  
cafes  
or  
restaurants  
provide  V01
Halal  
food  <ARG1
?  

Some  
friends  >ARG0
of  
mine  
visited  V01
Dartmouth  <ARG1
in  
Devon  <ARGM-LOC
whilst  
on  
holiday  V01
last  
summer  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
find  V01
any  
cafes  >ARG0
or  
food  
shops  
that  >R-ARG0
provided  V01
Halal  
prepared  
foods  <ARG1
.  

It  
s  V01
important  V01
to  
their  
religion  <ARG2
that  
they  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
consume  V01
Halal  
food  <ARG1
.  

Even  
if  
you  >ARG0
buy  V01
a  
cake  <ARG1
in  
a  
baker  <ARGM-LOC
s  
you  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
too  <ARG2
what  >ARG1
happens  V01
in  
the  
kitchen  <ARGM-LOC
,  
for  
example  >>>ARGM-ADV
the  
cake  >>>ARG1
may  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V03
sliced  V01
using  V01
a  
knife  >ARG1
used  V01
for  
preparing  V01
ham  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
s  V01
simply  <ARGM-ADV
not  <ARGM-NEG
just  
a  
case  V04
of  
avoiding  V01
pork  
,  
alcohol  <ARG1
and  
only  >>ARGM-ADV
being  V03
allowed  V01
to  
eat  V01
halal  
prepared  
meat  <ARG1
,  
but  
the  
kitchen  >>>ARG1
and  
its  
utensils  
should  >>>ARGM-MOD
not  >>>ARGM-NEG
have  V01
been  V03
used  V01
for  
prohibited  
foods  <ARG2
.  

Places  >>>ARG0
like  
Dartmouth  
are  V03
supposed  V02
to  
be  V01
tourist  
towns  <ARG2
and  
should  >ARGM-MOD
provide  V01
foods  <ARG1
for  
people  <ARG2
of  
all  
religions  
.  

We  >ARG0
all  
enjoy  V01
buying  V01
a  
snack  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
visiting  V01
a  
town  <ARG1
or  
attraction  V01
while  
on  
holiday  V01
.  

Not  
everyone  >>ARG0
wants  V01
to  
bring  V01
packed  
lunch  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
s  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
fair  V01
if  
some  
people  >>>ARG0
have  V02
to  
go  V02
without  
buying  V01
food  <ARG1
because  
no  
place  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
provide  V01
suitable  
food  <ARG1
for  
them  
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
it  
s  V01
only  >ARGM-ADV
fair  V01
that  
nowadays  >ARGM-TMP
every  
town  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
provide  V01
at  
least  
one  
halal  
cafe  <ARG1
or  
restaurant  
and  
hopefully  >ARGM-ADV
one  
day  >ARGM-TMP
every  
British  
catering  
establishment  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
halal  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
went  V02
to  
Bosnia  <ARG4
,  
all  
the  
meat  >ARG1
was  V01
Halal  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
eat  V01
halal  
meat  <ARG1
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
guess  V01
what  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
opted  V01
for  
foods  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
were  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
a  
meat  
dish  <ARG2
,  
there  
were  V02
plenty  <ARG1
of  
other  
options  
.  

I  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
go  V02
to  
their  
country  <ARG4
and  
demand  V01
they  >>ARG0
slaughter  V01
and  
sell  V01
an  
animal  <ARG1
as  
meat  <ARGM-PRD
the  
way  >ARGM-MNR
I  >>ARG0
prefer  V01
to  
eat  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
go  V02
to  
another  
country  <ARG4
,  
you  >ARG0
live  V01
by  
their  >ARG0
way  V01
of  
life  <ARG1
and  
their  
laws  
,  
if  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
know  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
get  V05
back  <ARG2
out  
the  
country  
(  
but  
I  >ARG0
guess  V01
our  
benefits  
system  >>>ARG0
is  V01
too  >ARGM-CXN
much  V01
to  
throw  V07
away  
,  
huh  <<ARGM-DIS
)  
.  

Cafes  >ARG0
and  
restaurants  
rarely  >ARGM-TMP
use  V01
the  
same  
cutlery  <ARG1
for  
different  
food  
groups  
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >ARG0
normally  >ARGM-ADV
have  V03
blue  <ARG1
for  
bakery  
items  <ARG1
,  
red  <ARG1
for  
cooked  
meat  
,  
brown  <ARG1
for  
raw  
meat  
,  
etc  <ARG1
-  <ARG1
all  
for  
food  >ARG1
preparation  V01
and  
hygiene  
policies  <<ARG1
.  

No  
.  

To  
prevent  V01
animal  
cruelty  <ARG1
,  
many  
countries  >ARG0
forbid  V01
Halal  
and  
Kosher  
meat  <ARG1
.  

Switzerland  >ARG1
is  V01
one  <ARG2
,  
and  
the  
Netherlands  >>ARG0
are  V03
passing  V01
the  
same  
law  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
become  V01
EU  
law  <ARG2
in  
a  
couple  <ARGM-TMP
of  
years  
.  

We  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
dictate  V01
what  
business  >>ARG1
wants  V01
to  
open  V01
where  <ARGM-LOC
.  

If  
someone  >ARG0
thinks  V01
there  
is  V02
a  
business  
opportunity  <ARG1
then  >ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
start  V01
opening  V01
halal  
only  
places  <ARG1
.  

How  >ARGM-MNR
to  
convince  V01
my  
parents  >ARG0
to  
let  V01
me  >ARG0
get  V01
a  
Ball  
python  <ARG1
?  

They  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
ANYTHING  <ARG1
about  
Ball  
pythons  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
ask  V02
my  
mom  <ARG2
she  >ARG0
says  V01
she  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
let  V01
a  
snake  <ARG1
in  
her  
house  <ARG1
.  

She  >>>ARG0
has  VLV
no  >ARGM-NEG
experience  V01
with  
snakes  <ARG1
and  
has  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
held  V01
one  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
did  V02
all  
my  >ARG0
research  V01
and  
am  V01
well  
prepared  <ARG2
to  
keep  V01
one  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG1
'm  V01
14  <ARG2
by  
the  
way  <ARGM-DIS

Lay  V01
some  
knowledge  <ARG1
on  
them  <ARG2
dude  <ARGM-DIS
.  

Maybe  
if  
they  >ARG0
see  V01
how  
much  >ARGM-EXT
time  >>>ARG1
and  
effort  V01
you  >>>ARG0
've  V01
devoted  V01
to  
researching  V01
the  
animal  <ARG1
they  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
reconsider  V01
.  

Tell  V01
them  <ARG2
it  
costs  V01
like  
8  
dollars  <ARG2
a  
month  
(  
if  
even  
that  
much  <ARGM-ADV
)  
to  
keep  V02
it  >ARG2
fed  V01
.  

Be  V01
helpful  V04
around  
the  
house  <ARGM-LOC
to  
show  V01
that  
even  
if  
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
pay  V01
for  
it  <ARG3
yourself  <ARGM-REC
that  
you  >>>ARG0
re  V01
willing  V02
to  
work  V01
for  
it  <ARGM-GOL
.  

Once  
you  >>ARG0
've  V01
buttered  V01
them  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-DIR
a  
bit  <ARGM-EXT
try  V01
to  
get  V05
them  <ARG1
to  
the  
pet  
store  <ARG2
and  
ask  V02
one  >ARG0
of  
the  
employees  
to  
handle  V01
the  
snake  <ARG1
showing  V01
your  
mom  <ARG2
how  
gentle  >ARG2
and  
harmless  
they  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
.  

Maybe  
even  >ARGM-ADV
try  V01
to  
get  V04
your  
mom  >ARG0
to  
hold  V01
it  <ARG1
a  
bit  <ARGM-ADV
.  

My  
wife  >>ARG1
was  V01
TERRIFIED  V01
of  
snakes  <ARG0
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
met  V02
,  
I  >ARG0
introduced  V01
her  <ARG1
to  
one  <ARG2
out  
my  
baby  
corn  
snakes  
and  
she  >ARG1
fell  V07
in  
love  V01
with  
it  <<ARGM-COM
.  

Be  V01
persistent  V01
,  
but  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
pester  V01
them  <ARG1
about  
it  <ARGM-ADV
cause  
that  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
get  V05
you  <ARG1
nowhere  <ARG2
fast  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Good  
luck  
!  

My  
general  
convince  V01
your  
parents  >ARG0
to  
let  V01
you  >ARG0
get  V01
a  
reptile  <ARG1
advice  
:  

1  
.  
Be  V01
responsible  V02
.  

Do  V02
all  
your  
chores  <ARG1
without  
being  V03
nagged  V01
,  
take  VLV
care  V03
of  
any  
existing  
pets  <ARG1
,  
keep  V02
your  
room  >ARG1
clean  V04
,  
and  
so  
on  
.  

Prove  V01
,  
to  
your  
parents  >ARG1
'  
satisfaction  V01
,  
that  
you  >ARG1
,  
not  
they  
,  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
the  
one  >>ARG0
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
taking  VLV
care  V03
of  
your  
new  
pet  <ARG1
.  

2  
.  
Save  V04
up  
,  
and  
research  V01
,  
so  
that  
you  >>ARG1
are  V01
ready  V02
for  
your  
new  
pet  <ARG2
.  

3  
.  
Bargain  V01
with  
them  <ARG2
.  

Offer  V01
to  
do  V02
extra  
chores  <ARG1
,  
ask  V02
for  
your  
pet  <ARG1
as  
a  
reward  <ARGM-PRD
for  
good  
grades  
,  
something  <ARGM-ADV
like  
that  
.  

4  
.  
Play  V01
the  
sympathy  
card  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
find  V01
a  
pet  <ARG1
at  
a  
shelter  <ARGM-LOC
,  
or  
that  >>>ARG1
a  
friend  >>>ARG0
needs  V01
to  
get  VLV
rid  V01
of  <C-ARG1
because  
they  >>ARG1
're  V03
moving  V01
or  
whatever  
,  
you  >>>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
talk  V02
your  
parents  <ARG1
into  
"  
giving  V01
it  <ARG2
a  
good  
home  <ARG1
"  
where  >>ARGM-LOC
you  >>>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V01
able  V01
to  
talk  V02
them  <ARG1
into  
buying  V01
a  
new  
pet  <ARG1
.  

On  
the  
fear  
angle  >ARGM-ADV
--  
talk  V02
her  <ARG1
into  
coming  V01
to  
the  
pet  
store  <ARG4
with  
you  <ARGM-COM
.  

Once  
you  >ARG1
're  V01
there  >ARGM-TMP
,  
ask  V02
if  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
hold  V01
a  
ball  
python  <ARG1
.  

Once  
you  >>ARG0
're  V03
holding  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
try  V01
to  
get  V04
her  >>ARG0
to  
touch  V01
/  
pet  V01
it  <ARG1
...  

My  
Snake  
's  
meal  >>ARG1
is  V01
TOO  >ARGM-EXT
big  V01
,  
what  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
do  V02
?  

Just  
today  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
bought  V01
a  
medium  
rat  <ARG1
for  
my  
beloved  
Ball  
Python  <ARG4
Salazar  >ARG1
(  
name  V02
after  
Harry  <ARG2
Potter  
)  
.  

Last  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
got  V01
a  
medium  
rat  <ARG1
it  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
girl  <ARG2
and  
my  
snake  >ARG0
handled  V01
her  <ARG1
easily  <ARGM-MNR
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
today  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
got  V01
a  
boy  <ARG1
and  
realized  V01
that  
he  >>ARG1
is  V01
HUGE  V01
!  

I  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
love  V01
my  
snake  <ARG1
cause  
she  >ARG1
is  V01
actually  <ARGM-ADV
an  
affectionate  
cold  
-  
blooded  
creature  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
my  
true  
question  >ARG1
comes  V01
to  
this  <ARG4
,  
how  >ARGM-MNR
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
knock  V03
the  
rat  <ARG1
out  <C-V
?  

If  
I  >ARG0
threw  V01
him  <ARG1
against  
a  
wall  <ARG2
and  
still  
conscious  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
run  V02
away  <ARGM-DIR
,  
do  V01
I  >ARG0
hang  V01
him  <ARG1
by  
the  
tail  <ARGM-MNR
so  
the  
blood  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
flush  V01
into  
his  
skull  <ARGM-DIR
?  

I  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
need  V01
answers  V01
and  
advice  
,  
and  
NOT  
INSULTING  >ARGM-ADJ

SERIOUSLY

Best  >ARGM-ADJ
answer  V01

receive  V01
points  <ARG1
:)  

iw  >>ARG0
ould  >>ARGM-MOD
just  >>ARGM-ADV
stick  V01
him  <ARG1
in  
the  
tank  <ARG2
and  
let  V01
your  
snake  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
nice  
hunt  <ARG1
for  
once  <ARGM-TMP
,  
snakes  
jaws  >ARG1
detach  V01
for  
this  
sort  <ARGM-PRP
of  
this  
thing  
,  
so  
why  >ARGM-PRP
not  >ARGM-NEG
give  V01
her  <ARG2
a  
good  
hunt  <ARG1
,  
but  
if  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
want  V01
him  
knock  V01
him  <ARG1
i  >ARG0
d  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV

wall  <ARG2
or  
something  
,,

with  
you  <ARG2
though  <ARGM-ADV
throw  V01
him  <ARG1

haha  <ARGM-DIS

Ok  >>ARGM-DIS
so  >>ARGM-DIS
if  
youre  
snake  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
take  V01
pre-killed  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD

.  

Just  >>>ARGM-ADV

the  
rat  <ARG1
in  
a  
sealed  V01
tupperwear  
container  <ARG1
with  
no  
airholes  
and  
wait  V01
until  
it  >>ARG1
passes  V11
out  
and  
dies  V01
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
feed  V01
it  <ARG2
.  

If  
it  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
take  V01
pre-killed  <ARG1
and  
you  >ARG0
usually  >ARGM-ADV
feed  V01
live  <ARG1
then  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
hold  V01
the  
rat  <ARG1
by  
the  
tail  <ARGM-MNR
and  
whack  V01
it  <ARG1
against  
a  
hard  
surface  <ARG2
,  
like  
a  
refrigerator  <ARGM-MNR
or  
wall  
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like  V01
that  
option  <ARG1
though  <ARGM-ADV
-  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
it  >>ARG1
's  V01
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
cruel  V01
and  
I'd  
not  >ARGM-NEG
done  V02
properly  <ARGM-MNR
you  >>>ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
end  V03
up  
really  >ARGM-ADV
hurting  V01
the  
rat  <ARG1
but  
not  >ARGM-NEG
stunning  V01
him  <ARG1
enough  <ARGM-EXT
to  
stop  V01
possible  >ARGM-ADJ
injury  V01
to  
your  
snake  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
the  
tupperwear  
idea  <ARG1
TBH  <ARGM-ADV
-  
easiest  
and  
most  
humane  
.  

You  >>>ARG0
could  >>>ARGM-MOD
also  >>>ARGM-ADV
just  >>>ARGM-ADV
wait  V01
until  
the  
rat  >ARG0
passes  V11
out  
for  
about  
1  
minute  <ARGM-TMP
and  
them  >ARG2
feed  V01
it  <ARG1
-  
at  
this  
point  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
it  >>>ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
have  V03
a  
bit  <ARG1
of  
a  
heart  >ARG1
beat  V02
and  
be  V01
slightly  >ARGM-EXT
still  >ARGM-TMP
alive  V01
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
also  >ARGM-ADV
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
try  V01
holding  V01
the  
rat  <ARG1
in  
feeding  
prongs  <ARGM-MNR
so  
your  
snake  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
get  VLV
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
hold  V01
and  
grip  
on  
his  
prey  <ARG1
.  

Good  
luck  
!  

Just  
my  
opinion  
here  
-  
no  >ARGM-NEG
judgement  V01
-  
getting  V04
your  
snake  <ARG1
on  
frozen  <ARG1
/  
thawed  V01
will  >ARGM-MOD
prove  V01
to  
be  V01
much  >ARGM-EXT
easier  V05
for  
you  <ARGM-GOL
and  
safer  V01
for  
your  
snake  <ARG1
in  
the  
long  >ARGM-ADJ
run  V13
.  

My  
opinion  
-  
take  V04
it  <ARG1
for  
what  >>ARG2
it  >>ARG1
's  V01
worth  V02
…  
:-)  

Looking  V04
to  
move  V01
to  
Toronto  <ARG2
?  

I  >ARG1
am  V01
a  
20  
something  
gay  
black  
male  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG0
am  V03
looking  V01
for  
suggestions  V01
on  
neighborhoods  <ARG1
close  
to  
the  
downtown  
Toronto  
area  
.  

Im  >ARG1
moving  V01
from  
South  
Carolina  <ARGM-DIR
so  >ARGM-ADV
this  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
already  >ARGM-ADV
be  V01
a  
huge  >ARGM-EXT
culture  >ARG0
shock  V01
.  

Any  
suggestions  V01
?  

Being  V01
gay  V01
and  
living  V01
in  
Toronto  <ARGM-LOC
is  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
fine  V04
.  

You  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
consider  V02
the  
Gay  
Village  <ARG1
on  
Church  
Street  
,  
right  
downtown  
.  

It  >>ARG1
is  V01
full  V01
of  
gay  
friendly  
"  
everything  <ARG2
"  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
live  V01
where  
ever  >>ARG3
you  >ARG0
fancy  V02
takes  V01
you  <ARG1
.  

For  
obvious  
reasons  >>>ARGM-CAU
,  
knowing  V01
how  
extremely  
difficult  >ARG2
it  
is  V01
to  
drive  V01
a  
car  <ARG1
in  
the  
city  <ARGM-LOC
,  
you  >>ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
try  V01
to  
be  V01
near  
the  
subway  
system  <ARG2
.  

But  
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
immigrate  V01
?  

Being  V01
an  
American  >ARG0
guarantees  V01
you  <ARG2
no  
favours  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
it  
come  V12
to  
going  V02
to  
Canada  <ARG4
.  

Start  V01
your  >ARG0
process  V02
here  <<ARGM-LOC
,  
if  
you  
have  V01
n't  
already  <<<ARGM-ADV
.  

(  
Marrying  V01
a  
Canadian  <ARG2
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
enough  V01
-  
that  >>ARG1
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
count  V04
for  
at

two  
years  <ARGM-TMP

5

Coming  V28
to  
stay  V01
,  
and  
overstay  V01
your  >ARG0
three

expulsion  V01
and  
a  
lifetime  
ban  
to  
immigrate  V01
to

-  
NOT  
GOOD  
.  

Let  V01

about  
this  <ARG1
...........  

Just  >ARGM-ADV
'  
wanting  V01

You  >>>ARG1
MUST  >>>ARGM-MOD
apply  V01
,  
to  
become  V01
a  
Immigrant  <ARG2
,  
and  
WAIT  V01
to  
be  V03
approved  V01

by  
the  
Canadian

YOUR  >ARG1
education  V01
(  
the

your

combined  
with  
a

are  V03
all  
taken  VLV
into  
consideration  V02
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
competition  V01
,  
and  
YOU  >>ARG0

be  V03
competing  V01

hundreds

So  >>ARGM-DIS
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
pack  V01
your

,  
yet  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Whatever  >ARG1
you  >ARG0

DO  V01

How  >ARGM-MNR
to  
train  V01
my  
puppy  <ARG2
?  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
4  
months  
Shih  
Tzu  
puppy  <ARG1
.  

Recently  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
having  V03
trouble  <ARG1
training  V01
him  <ARG2
.  

He  >>ARG0
is  V03
kind  >ARGM-ADV
of  
hate  V01
walking  V01
with  
leash  <ARGM-MNR
,  
every  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
put  V01
the  
leash  <ARG1
on  <ARG2
,  
he  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
try  V01
to  
bite  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
he  >>ARG1
is  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
following  V01
me  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
walking  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
saw  V01
lots  <ARG1
of  
videos  
about  
this  
,  
but  
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
it  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
help  V01
.  

Is  V02
there  
any  
way  V01
can  >ARGM-MOD
let  V01
him  >ARG0
know  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
walk  V01
with  
leash  <ARGM-MNR
?  

And  >>>ARGM-DIS
every  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
see  V01
some  
one  <ARG1
he  >>>ARG0
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
rush  V01
to  
people  <ARG2
and  
jump  V03
on  
them  <ARGM-LOC
,  
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
listen  V01
to  
me  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG1
is  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
excited  V01
about  
anybody  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
see  V01
.  

How  >ARGM-MNR
to  
prevent  V01
this  <ARG1
?  

Last  
thing  >ARG1
is  V01
every  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
sit  V01
on  
a  
chair  <ARG2
or  
something  
higher  
than  
him  
,  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
try  V01
to  
jump  V03
on  <ARGM-DIR
,  
if  
he  
ca  >ARGM-ADV
n't  
,  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
bark  V01
all  
the  
time  <ARGM-TMP
until  
I  >ARG0
let  V01
him  >ARG1
get  V05
on  <ARG2
,  
what  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
do  V02
with  
this  <ARG2
?  

Anyone  
have  VLV
any  
suggestion  V01
?  

thank  V01
you  <ARG1
very  
much  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Hi  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG1
am  V01
a  
dog  
trainer  <ARG2
for  
25  
yrs  
.  

You  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
purchase  V01
what  >>ARG1
is  V03
called  V01
a  
shoulder  
point  
harness  <ARG2
.  

This  
type  >>ARG0
of  
harness  
goes  V01
around  
the  
dog  
s  
chest  <ARG4
and  
legs  
and  
has  V03
a  
clip  <ARG1
for  
the  
leash  
up  
on  
the  
back  
of  
the  
dog  
in  
middle  
of  
shoulder  
blades  
.  

This  
way  V01
,  
he  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
reach  V01
the  
leash  <ARG1
to  
chew  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
swivels  V01
his  
head  <ARG1
to  
go  V03
for  
it  <ARG1
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
,  
tell  V01
him  <ARG2
sharp  <ARGM-MNR
"  
UH  <ARG1
UH  
"  
gently  >ARGM-MNR
correct  V01
him  <ARG1
with  
a  
small  
tug  <ARGM-MNR
and  
continue  V01
your  >ARG0
walk  V01
.  

Do  V02
this  <ARG1
repeatedly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
frequently  
and  
he  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
learn  V01
to  
walk  V01
on  
a  
leash  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Patience  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
key  <ARG2
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

He  >>ARG0
is  V01
a  
young  
pup  <ARG2
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
learn  V01
over  
time  <ARGM-MNR
and  
consistency  
in  
his  >ARG2
training  V01
.  

And  
always  
,  
always  >ARGM-TMP
train  V01
with  
love  V01
and  
positive  
methods  
-  
never  >>ARGM-NEG
hit  V01
or  
harshly  >ARGM-MNR
scold  V01
.  

Never  >ARGM-NEG
train  V01
out  
of  
fear  V01
.  

You  >ARG0
want  V01
your  
dog  >>ARG0
to  
admire  V01
you  <ARG1
as  
his  
pack  
leader  <ARGM-PRD
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
fear  V01
you  <ARG1
.  

Good  
luck  
with  
your  
puppy  
!  

All  
the  
best  
.  

Put  V01
him  <ARG1
in  
dog  
obedience  
school  <ARG2
or  
call  V02
a  
professional  
dog  
trainer  <ARG1
.  
:)  

why  
do  V01
nt  >>>ARGM-NEG
you  >>>ARG0
get  V01
some  
treats  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
he  >ARG0
loves  V01
and  
only  >ARGM-ADV
give  V01
him  <ARG2
them  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
does  V02
something  <ARG1
right  <ARGM-MNR
.  

or  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
as  
i  >ARG0
saw  V01
on  
embarrassing  
pets  <ARG1
on  
tv  <ARGM-MNR
,  
get  V01
a  
clicker  
type  
thing  <ARG1
and  
treats  
as  
well  
.  

try  V01
to  
train  V01
him  >ARG0
to  
heel  V02
,  
which  >ARG1
means  V01
to  
walk  V01
round  
you  <ARG2
before  
he  >>ARG1
needs  V01
to  
go  V08
on  
a  
leash  <ARG2
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
that  <ARG1
.  

or  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
even  >ARGM-ADV
spray  V01
some  
scented  V01
spray  <ARG1
on  
the  
leash  <<ARG2
and  
he  >>>ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
go  V03
for  
the  
scent  <ARG1
and  
probably  
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
act  V02
quick  
enough  <ARGM-TMP
,  
will  >ARGM-MOD
stay  V01
on  
the  
leash  <ARG3
.  

What  
sort  >>ARG1
of  
Hotel  >>ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
I  >>ARG0
expect  V01
to  
find  V01
in  
New  
Delhi  <ARGM-LOC
/  
Agra  
/  
Varanasi  
for  
rs  <ARGM-ADV
500  
per  
night  
?  

Hey  
guys  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
'm  V03
looking  V04
to  
visit  V01
India  <ARG1
with  
some  
mates  <ARGM-COM
at  
the  
beginning  V01
of  
February  <ARG1
next  
year  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
I  
am  V03
wandering  
what  
standard  >>ARG1
of  
accommodation  V01
we  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
for  
Rs  <ARG3
500  
per  
person  
per  
night  
.  

There  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V02
four  <ARG1
of  
us  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0
would  
probably  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V03
looking  V01
at  
2  
twin  
rooms  <ARG1
for  
Rs  
1000  
,  
close  
to  
the  
centre  
of  
these  
cities  
.  

This  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
on  
a  
walk  V01
-  
in  
basis  <<ARG2
as  
we  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
have  V03
the  
freedom  <ARG1
of  
finding  V01
a  
place  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
looks  V02
good  V02
(  
Not  >ARGM-NEG
relying  V01
on  
pictures  <ARG1
from  
the  
internet  
)  
and  
is  V01
in  
a  
spot  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
like  V01
.  

Thanks  V01
in  
advance  V01
for  
sharing  V01
your  >ARG0
experience  V01
!  

Sorry  
,  
almost  >ARGM-ADV
forgot  V01
to  
ask  V01
-  
Would  >>ARGM-MOD
it  
be  V01
cheaper  V02
to  
walk  V01
-  
in  
to  
these  
hotels  <ARG2
rather  
than  
pre  >ARGM-TMP
book  V03
?  

In  
Delhi  >ARGM-LOC
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
recommend  V01
Ajay  
Guesthouse  <ARG1
.  

Travelled  V01
to  
Delhi  <ARG1
twice  <ARGM-TMP
and  
stayed  V01
there  <ARG3
twice  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Rooms  >ARG1
start  V01
from  
500  <ARGM-DIR
per  
double  
.  

Those  
ones  >>ARG1
are  V01
quite  >ARGM-EXT
small  V01
.  

Must  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
,  
in  
Delhi  >>ARGM-LOC
it  
's  V01
hard  V02
to  
get  V01
good  >ARGM-ADJ
price  V01
/  
quality  >ARG3
rating  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
found  V01
this  
hotel  <ARG1
in  
the  
Lonely  
Planet  
guide  <ARGM-LOC
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
in  
an  
area  >ARG1
starting  V01
with  
a  
P  <ARG2
,  
many  
tourist  
hotels  
there  
and  
the  
location  >>ARG1
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
nice  V01
.  

But  
in  
general  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Delhi  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
hardest  
place  >ARGM-LOC
to  
find  V01
a  
nice  
clean  
hotel  <ARG1
for  
that  
price  V01
.  

In  
Varanasi  >>ARGM-LOC
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
.  

I  >>ARG1
've  V01
stayed  V01
in  
a  
more  
expensive  
hotel  <ARG3
there  <ARGM-LOC
,  
but  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
check  V01
some  
travelguides  <ARG1
or  
tripadvisor  
?  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
while  
travelling  V01
ask  V01
people  <ARG2
where  >>ARG2
they  >>ARG1
've  V01
been  V01
and  
if  
they  >ARG0
have  V03
any  
hotel  >ARG1
recommendations  V01
.  

In  
Agra  >>ARGM-LOC
I  >>ARG1
've  V01
stayed  V01
in  
a  
place  >ARG1
fellow  
travellers  >ARG0
recommended  V01
,  
they  >ARG0
found  V01
it  <ARG1
in  
the  
Rough  
Guide  <ARGM-LOC
.  

It  >>>ARG1
was  V01
nice  V01
and  
close  V10
to  
the  
Taj  <ARG2
.  

It  
was  V01
quite  >ARGM-EXT
easy  V05
to  
find  V01
something  <ARG1
.  

(  
Do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
stay  V01
in  
Agra  <ARG3
too  
long  <ARGM-TMP
.  

One  
night  >>ARG1
is  V01
enough  V01
!  
)  

There  
were  V02
many  
hotels  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
ve  V01
paid  V01
500  <ARG1
for  
a  
double  
room  
there  <ARGM-LOC
and  
it  >>>ARG1
was  V01
fine  V04
and  
clean  V04
.  

Good  
luck  
,  
enjoy  V01
your  
time  <ARG1
!  

You  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
find  V01
a  
normal  
budget  
hotel  <ARG1

Rs  <ARGM-ADV

To  
Stay  V01
in  
delhi  <ARG3
-  
Hotel  
Aster  
Inn  >>ARG1
is  V01
best  V02
to  
stay  V01
in  
delhi  <ARGM-LOC
.  

it  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
karol  
bagh  <ARG2
.  

some  
beautiful  
locations  >ARG1
like  
close  
to  
Karol  
Bagh  
Shopping  
Market  
,  
Presidential  
Palace  
,  
and  
Birla  
Mandir  
Temple  
and  
Connaught  
Place  
and  
Jantar  
Mantar  
are  V01
near  <ARG2
to  
it  
.  

TO  
Stay  V01
in  
Agra  <ARG3
-  
Hotel  
Atithi  >>ARG1
and  
Aditya  
Palace  
is  V01
perfect  V02
for  
you  <ARG2
.  

it  >>ARG1
is  V03
centrally  >ARG2
situated  V01
.  

To  
Stay  V01
in  
Varanasi  <ARG3
-  
Sandeep  
Hotel  >ARG1
is  V01
you  >ARG0
choice  V01
...  

which  
one  >ARG1
out  
of  
these  
makes  V06
the  
best  
pet  <ARG2
?  

a  
degu  
,  
a  
rat  
,  
a  
mouse  
,  
a  
hamster  
or  
a  
guinea  
pig  
?  

and  
why  >ARGM-PRP
is  V01
the  
one  <ARG1
a  
better  
pet  <ARG2
?  

Get  V01
a  
guinea  
pig  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
hamster  <ARG1
,  
and  
mice  >>ARG0
and  
rats  
like  V02
to  
escape  V01
.  

The  
Guinea  
pig  >>ARG1
is  V01
better  V02
because  
it  >>ARG1
s  V01
a  
lot  >ARGM-EXT
larger  V01
than  
a  
hamster  <ARGM-CXN
,  
rat  
,  
mouse  
,  
or  
degu  
.  

So  >>>ARGM-DIS
if  
you  >ARG0
lose  V02
him  <ARG1
,  
he  >>ARG1
is  V01
easier  V05
to  
find  V01
,  
because  
smaller  
rodents  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
LOVE  V02
to  
escape  V01
from  
their  
cages  <ARG1
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
my  
opinion  >ARG1
is  V01
Guinea  
pigs  <ARG2
.  

(  
plus  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG1
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
stink  V01
that  
bad  <ARGM-EXT
)  

Depends  V01
on  
what  >>>ARG0
you  >ARG0
want  V01
in  
a  
pet  <ARG4
,  
to  
be  V01
honest  V01
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
depends  V01
on  
the  
space  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
have  V03
,  
how  
much  
time  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
handle  V01
the  
pet  <ARG1
,  
how  
much  
money  >ARG3
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
spend  V01
,  
etc  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
've  V01
had  VLV
experience  V01
with  
all  <ARG1
of  
those  
pets  
except  
Degus  
.  

My  
favorite  >>ARG1
would  
have  V02
to  
be  V01
the  
rat  <ARG2
.  

They  >>>ARG1
're  V01
incredibly  >ARGM-EXT
social  V03
,  
highly  
trainable  
,  
and  
very  >ARGM-EXT
clean  V04
.  

Mine  >>>ARG0
learned  V01
to  
"  
go  V29
to  
the  
bathroom  <ARGM-GOL
"  
only  
in  
their  
cages  <ARGM-LOC
and  
loved  V02
to  
ride  V01
on  
my  
shoulder  <ARG1
or  
hang  V06
out  
in  
my  
hoodie  
pouch  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
only  
downside  >ARG1
is  V01
they  >>>ARG0
should  >>>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
kept  V01
in  
pairs  <ARGM-MNR
or  
trios  
and  
require  V01
a  
pretty  
large  
habitat  <ARG1
.  

That  >ARG1
means  V01
expense  
,  
space  <ARG2
,  
and  
they  >ARG0
require  V01
weekly  >ARGM-TMP
cage  >ARG1
cleaning  V01
.  

My  
second  
favorite  >>ARG1
would  
have  V02
to  
be  V01
the  
Guinea  
Pig  >ARG0
-  
not  >ARGM-NEG
quite  >ARGM-EXT
as  >ARGM-CXN
social  V03
with  
people  <ARGM-COM
as  
rats  <C-ARGM-CXN
(  
at  >ARGM-ADV
least  
mine  >ARG1
was  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
)  
but  
more  
so  
than  
most  
hamsters  
or  
mice  
.  

Again  
,  
pairs  
or  
trios  
and  
pretty  
big  
living  
space  
.  

They  >>>ARG1
,  
too  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
need  V01
weekly  >ARGM-TMP
cage  >ARG1
cleaning  V01
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
cost  V01
quite  
a  
bit  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
handle  V01
my  
mice  <ARG1
,  
but  
they  >>ARG0
where  V01
skittish  <ARG2
and  
preferred  V01
their  
cage  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
've  V01
never  >ARGM-TMP
met  V02
a  
hamster  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
bite  V01
me  <ARG1
.  

Never  >>ARGM-NEG
had  V03
/  
handled  V01
a  
Degu  <ARG1
.  

Get  V01
a  
guinea  
pig  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
have  V03
two  <ARG1
.  

They  >>>ARG1
are  V01
social  V03
and  
like  V02
to  
be  V03
handled  V01
.  

You  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
have  V03
two  <ARG1
because  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
well  <ARGM-MNR
alone  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Make  V02
certain  V01
you  >ARG0
get  V01
two  
females  <ARG1
.  

Two  
males  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
fight  V01
and  
you  >>ARG0
definitely  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
babies  <ARG1
!!  

Guinea  
pigs  >>>ARG0
(  
also  >ARGM-ADV
called  V01
cavies  <ARG2
)  
are  V01
gentle  
creatures  <ARG2
and  
are  V01
awake  V03
during  
the  
day  <ARGM-TMP
and  
sleep  V01
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
whistle  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
hear  V01
you  <ARG2
as  
an  
encouragement  V01
for  
you  >ARG0
to  
give  V01
them  <ARG2
a  
treat  <ARG1
like  
leaf  
lettuce  
.  

They  >ARG0
love  V01
leaf  
or  
romaine  
lettuce  <ARG1
and  
tomatos  
,  
celery  
,  
cucumbers  
,  
carrots  
.  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
feed  V01
them  <ARG2
broccoli  <ARG1
,  
cauliflower  
,  
garlic  
,  
onions  
,  
head  
lettuce  
....  
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
all  >ARGM-ADV
too  >ARGM-CXN
difficult  V01
for  
them  >ARG0
to  
digest  V01
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
eat  V01
potatos  <ARG1
,  
they  >>ARG0
are  V01
toxic  V01
for  
them  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
keep  V02
the  
cage  >ARG1
clean  V04
they  >>ARG1
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
smell  V02
and  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
buy  V01
spray  V01
on  <ARGM-DIR
cleaser  <ARG1
for  
them  <<ARG4
,  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
massage  V01
it  <ARG1
into  
their  
coat  <ARGM-DIR
and  
groom  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

Fostering  V01
6  
week  
old  
kittens  <ARG1
and  
HATING  V01
IT  <ARG1
!  

Need  V01
Advice  <ARG1
!?  

I  >>>ARG0
wanted  V01
to  
volunteer  V01
and  
help  V01
animals  <ARG1
,  
and  
decided  V01
to  
try  V01
fostering  V01
kittens  <ARG1
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
my  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
experience  V01
and  
I  >>ARG1
have  V03
two  
six  
week  
old  
kittens  <ARG1
right  
now  <ARGM-TMP
and  
am  V01
at  
my  
wit  >ARG1
s  
end  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
have  V02
to  
bring  V01
them  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
before  
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
eight  
weeks  >ARG2
old  V01
but  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
ruining  V01
my  
apartment  <ARG1
.  

They  >>>ARG0
track  V04
poop  <ARG1
everywhere  <ARGM-LOC
(  
most  
disgustingly  
my  
bed  <ARGM-LOC
....  
)  
,  
and  
am  V03
constantly  >ARGM-TMP
trying  V01
to  
climb  V01
up  <ARGM-DIR
everything  <ARG1
,  
including  
my  
bare  
legs  
!  

My  
legs  >>ARG1
and  
hands  
are  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
full  V01
of  
scratches  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
realize  V01
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
young  V01
and  
that  
cats  >>ARG0
do  V01
climb  V01
,  
but  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
just  
ridiculous  <ARG2
.  

My  
apartment  >ARG1
also  >ARGM-DIS
smells  V02
repulsive  <ARG2
even  
though  
I  >>ARG0
am  V03
cleaning  V03
out  
their  
litter  
box  <ARG1
at  
least  
once  <ARGM-TMP
a  
day  
if  
not  
twice  
.  

Any  
suggestions  V01
and  
helpful  >ARGM-ADJ
hints  V01
to  
make  V02
this  <ARG1
a  
more  
positive  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
extremely  >ARGM-ADV
appreciated  V02
.  

That  >ARG1
's  V01
kind  <ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
way  V01
it  >ARG1
goes  V06
..  
lol  <<<ARGM-DIS
.  

Limit  V01
them  >ARG0
to  
one  
room  <ARG2
with  
easy  
to  
clean  V01
flooring  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
limited  
options  <ARG1
,  
try  V01
the  
bathroom  <ARG1
.  

Make  V02
sure  V01
there  
are  V02
plenty  <ARG1
of  
litter  
boxes  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are  V03
cleaned  V01
often  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Depending  
on  
the  
batch  >ARGM-ADV
of  
kittens  
,  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
often  >ARGM-TMP
have  V03
as  
many  <ARG1
as  
one  
per  
kitten  
.  

They  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
produce  V01
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
waste  V01
and  
even  >ARGM-ADV
scooping  V01
twice  
a  
day  <ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
get  V03
messy  <ARG2
.  

For  
some  
reason  >ARGM-CAU
it  
takes  V10
them  >>ARG1
awhile  <ARG1
to  
learn  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
step  V01
in  
poop  <ARG2
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
if  
they  >ARG0
have  V03
diarrhea  <ARG1
,  
check  V04
in  
with  
your  
foster  
coordinator  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
made  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
medication  V01
or  
deworming  V01
or  
something  
.  

They  >>ARG0
are  V03
testing  V01
out  <ARGM-ADV
their  
claws  <ARG1
and  
teeth  
.  

To  
some  
degree  >ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
/  
should  >ARGM-MOD
help  V01
teach  V01
them  >ARG0
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
use  V01
their  
teeth  <ARG1
and  
claws  
inappropriately  <ARGM-MNR
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
in  
the  
meantime  >ARGM-TMP
,  
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
jeans  <ARG1
and  
long  
sleeves  
anytime  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
interacting  V01
with  
the  
kittens  <ARG1
.  

Then  >>ARGM-DIS
take  VLV
care  V03
of  
yourself  <ARG1
.  

Get  V01
plenty  <ARG1
of  
sleep  
and  
make  V02
sure  V01
you  >>ARG0
take  V01
time  <ARG1
out  
to  
do  V02
some  
things  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
enjoy  V01
.  

Try  V01
visiting  V01
the  
kittens  <ARG1
a  
few  
times  <ARGM-TMP
a  
day  
for  
short  
periods  <ARGM-TMP
of  
time  
.  

Try  V01
to  
go  V02
in  
there  <ARG4
with  
the  
right  
frame  <ARGM-MNR
of  
mind  
and  
enjoy  V01
them  <ARG1
for  
what  >ARG2
they  >ARG1
are  V01
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
enjoy  V01
the  
kittens  <ARG1
,  
see  V01
what  
other  
opportunities  >>ARG2
are  V01
available  V02
.  

They  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
foster  
homes  <ARG1
for  
adult  
cats  >>ARG0
in  
different  
situations  
..  
sick

from  
surgery  <ARG2
,  
need  V01
a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
socialization  V01
,  
etc  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
find  V02
the  
adults  >>ARG1
are  V01
much  >ARGM-EXT
easier  V05
.  

Generally  >>>ARGM-ADV
they  >>>ARG0
're  V03
not  >>ARGM-NEG
clawing  V02
and  
biting  V01
,  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
make  V01
nearly  
as  
much  
mess  <ARG1
,  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
need  V01
nearly  
as  
much  >ARGM-ADV
litterbox  >ARG1
scooping  V01
,  
etc  
:)  

Decide  V01
volunteering  V01
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
your  
thing  <ARG2
and  
give  V03
them  <ARG1
back  <C-V
!  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
do  VLV
more  >ARGM-EXT
research  V01
before  
you  >ARG0
agree  V01
next  
time  <ARGM-TMP
;-)  

Take  V01
the  
kittens  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
to  
the  
shelter  
.  

Maybe  >>>ARGM-ADV
do  V02
volunteer  >ARG0
work  V01
at  
the  
humane  
society  <<ARGM-LOC

walk  V01

including

It  >ARG0
depends  V01
on  
if  
you  >ARG0
ever  >ARGM-TMP
registered  V02
the  
birth  V02
.  

Some  
places  >ARG0
do  V02
the  
registration  <ARG1
right  
at  
the  
hospital  <ARGM-LOC
....  
in  
some  
smaller  
places  >ARGM-LOC
,  
you  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
register  V02
your  
child  >ARG1
's  
birth  V02
at  
the  
town  
hall  <<ARGM-LOC
/  
registrar  
's  
office  
.  

My  
first  
three  
children  >>ARG1
were  V03
born  V02
in  
Southern  
Ontario  
cities  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
birth  >ARG1
registration  V02
was  V03
done  VLV
right  
in  
hospital  
.  

My  
last  
son  >>ARG1
,  
was  V03
born  V02
in  
Northern  
Ontario  <ARGM-LOC
....  

I  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
that  
I  >>>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
register  V02
him  <ARG1
in  
the  
ridiculous  
amount  <ARGM-MNR
of  
paperwork  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
had  V01
filled  V03
out  
in  
the  
hospital  <ARGM-LOC
and  
was  V03
supposed  V02
to  
go  V02
to  
city  
hall  <ARG4
within  
90  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Two  
years  
later  >>>ARGM-TMP
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
got  V03
around  <ARGM-PRD
to  
filling  V01
for  
his  
birth  
certificate  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
find  V03
out  
he  >>ARG1
was  V03
never  >ARGM-NEG
registered  V02
.  

I  >>>ARG0
had  V02
to  
call  V02
the  
Office  <ARG1
of  
the  
Registrar  
General  
in  
Thunder  
Bay  
,  
have  V04
copies  V01
of  
the  
delayed  
registration  
form  <ARG1
mailed  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR
to  
me  <ARG2
,  
as  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
an  
online  
area  <ARG1
for  
it  
yet  <ARGM-TMP
,  
fill  V03
those  <ARG1
out  <C-V
,  
send  V01
them  <ARG1
away  <ARGM-DIR
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
apply  V01
for  
his  
birth  
certificate  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
are  V03
just  >ARGM-ADV
applying  V01
for  
a  
birth  
certificate  <ARG1
for  
the  
first  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
it  
s  V01
simple  V02
to  
do  V02
it  <ARG1
over  
the  
computer  <ARG3
.  

For  
$  >>>ARG3
56  
you  >>>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
even  >ARGM-ADV
have  V04
it  >ARG1
expedited  V01
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
in  
three  
business  
days  <ARGM-TMP
or  
your  
money  
back  
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
Ontario  <ARG2
of  >>ARGM-ADV
course  
,  
the  
rates  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
slightly  >ARGM-EXT
different  V02
for  
other  
provinces  <ARG3
/  
territories  
.  

You  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
need  V01
basic  
information  <ARG1
,  
and  
answer  V01
a  
few  
questions  <ARG1
like  
what  
hospital  >>ARGM-LOC
was  V03
the  
child  >ARG1
born  V02
at  <C-ARGM-LOC
/  
who  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
doctor  <ARG2
....  

None  
,  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
walk  V01
in  
to  
the  
service  
office  <ARG2
and  
present  V01
all  
the  
identification  V01
you  
have  V02
to  
prove  V01
your  
identity  <ARG1
.  

they  >>>ARG0
may  >>>ARGM-MOD
then  >>>ARGM-ADV
chose  V01
to  
ask  V02
you  >ARG0
to  
bring  V01
more  
evidence  <ARG1
,  
or  
just  >ARGM-ADV
look  V05
up  
the  
record  <ARG1
and  
hand  V01
you  <ARG2
the  
certificate  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
do  V02
it  <ARG1
all  
on  
-  
line  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Start  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
if  
you  >>ARG1
were  V03
born  V02
in  
Ontario  <ARGM-LOC
.

Good  
luck  

My  
parents  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
send  V03
for  
my  
birth  
certificate  <ARG1
until  
I  >>ARG0
was  V01
16  <ARG2
and  
needed  V01
it  <ARG1
for  
summer  >ARGM-TMP
employment  V01
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
no  
problem  >ARG1
to  
get  V01
PROVIDED  
the  
birth  V02
was  V03
registered  V02
in  
the  
first  
place  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
add  V02
that  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
because  
there  
have  V01
been  V02
some  
people  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
have  V01
tried  V01
to  
claim  V02
citizenship  <ARG1
by  
sending  V02
for  
their  
birth  
certificate  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG1
were  V03
never  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-ADV
born  V02
in  
Canada  <ARGM-LOC
or  
to  
Canadian  
parents  
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
child  >>ARG1
is  V03
born  V02
in  
Canada  <ARGM-LOC
the  
birth  V02
is  V03
registered  V02
before  
the  
baby  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
leave  V11
the  
hospital  <ARG1
.  

As  
long  >>>ARGM-ADV
as  
that  >>ARG1
was  V03
done  V02
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
send  V02
for  
it  <ARG2
at  
any  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Each  
provincial  
government  >ARG0
has  V03
a  
website  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
lists  V01
the  
process  V02
for  
that  
Province  <ARGM-PRP
so  >>>ARGM-ADV
depending  
upon  
where  >>ARGM-LOC

Carnival  >ARG1
and  
Royal  
Caribbean  
are  V01
two  
popular  
cruise  
lines  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
have  V03
strong  >ARGM-ADJ
followings  V02
.  

Some  
cruise  
aficionados  >>ARG0
refuse  V01
to  
sail  V01
on  
one  <ARG1
or  
the  
other  
.  

Are  V02
there  
any  
major  >ARGM-EXT
differences  V02
between  
them  <ARG1
?  

Explore  V01
which  
cruise  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
fit  V01
your  >ARG0
needs  V01
the  
best  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

For  
our  >ARG0
comparison  V01
we  >ARG0
sailed  V01
on  
two  
similar  
ships  <ARG1
-  
the  
Carnival  
Liberty  
and  
the  
Royal  
Caribbean  
Mariner  
of  
the  
Seas  
.  

Itinerary  
Both  
ships  >ARG1
go  V01
to  
Caribbean  
Islands  <ARG4
like  
Jamaica  
,  
Grand  
Cayman  
,  
Cozumel  
,  
St.  
Thomas  
,  
the  
Bahamas  
and  
St.  
Martin  
/  
St.  
Maarten  
.  

The  
Liberty  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
visited  V01
its  
private  
island  <ARG1
Half  
Moon  
Cay  
,  
Puerto  
Rico  
,  
and  
Grand  
Turk  
.  

The  
Mariner  >ARG0
of  
the  
Seas  
traveled  V01
to  
its  
private  
island  <ARG1
Coco  
Cay  
and  
Labadee  
(  
the  
north  
coast  
of  
Haiti  
)  
.  

We  >>>ARG0
loved  V01
most  <ARG1
of  
the  
locations  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
both  >ARG0
of  
the  
ships  
visited  V01
and  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
believe  V01
that  
this  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
distinguishing  
factor  <ARG2
on  
deciding  V01
between  
the  
cruise  
lines  <ARG1
.  

Shows  V04
Each  
night  >ARGM-TMP
there  
are  V02
a  
variety  <ARG1
of  
shows  V04
.  

Usually  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
have  V03
the  
main  >ARGM-ADJ
show  V04
and  
some  
type  
of  
entertainment  
before  
and  
perhaps  
afterward  
.  

We  >ARG0
felt  V02
that  
the  
main  >ARGM-ADJ
shows  V04
on  
the  
Mariner  <ARG1
of  
the  
Seas  
were  V01
better  V02
.  

On  
the  
Liberty  >ARGM-LOC
we  >ARG0
liked  V01
the  
comedian  <ARG1
and  
juggling  
act  
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
love  V01
seeing  V01
the  
shows  V04
,  
Royal  
Caribbean  >>ARG1
was  V01
better  V03
for  
the  
main  >ARGM-ADJ
shows  V04
and  
Carnival  >>ARG1
was  V01
slightly  >ARGM-EXT
better  V03
for  
the  
comedians  <ARG2
.  

Dining  
Room  
We  >ARG0
enjoyed  V01
the  
atmosphere  <ARG1
of  
both  
dining  
rooms  
on  
the  
Liberty  
and  
Mariner  
of  
the  
Seas  
.  

We  >ARG0
felt  V02
that  
the  
menu  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
little  
more  
variety  <ARG1
on  
the  
Mariner  
of  
the  
Seas  
.  

Friendliness  
of  
staff  
The  
Liberty  >ARG0
and  
Mariner  
of  
the  
Seas  
both  
get  V01
high  
grades  <ARG1
.  

We  >>ARG0
did  V01
have  V03
one  
waiter  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
complained  V01
some  <ARGM-EXT
on  
one  <ARGM-TMP
of  
our  >ARG0
trips  V03
on  
the  
Mariner  <ARGM-MNR
.  

We  >>>ARG0
had  VLV
a  
slightly  
better  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
on  
the  
Liberty  <ARGM-LOC
,  
but  
feel  V02
that  
both  
crews  >ARG0
did  V02
an  
excellent  
job  <ARG1
and  
that  
this  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
a  
distinguishing  
factor  <ARG2
on  
choosing  V01
a  
cruise  <ARG1
.  

Pools  
The  
Mariner  >ARG0
of  
the  
Seas  
and  
Liberty  
both  
had  V03
salt  
water  
pools  >ARG1
-  
which  >R-ARG1
most  
cruise  
ships  >ARG0
have  V03
.  

They  >ARG0
both  
had  V03
pools  <ARG1
for  
kids  
and  
adults  
.  

We  >ARG0
liked  V01
the  
Liberty  
's  
pools  <ARG1
better  <ARGM-EXT
because  
one  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
slide  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
kids  <ARG1
,  
this  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
something  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
enjoy  V01
.  

Spa  
We  >>ARG0
tried  V01
the  
spa  <ARG1
on  
the  
Liberty  
and  
loved  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

We  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
try  V01
the  
spa  <ARG1
on  
the  
Mariner  
of  
the  
Seas  
.  

Usually  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go  V06
wrong  <ARGM-MNR
when  >ARGM-TMP
getting  V01
a  
spa  >ARG2
treatment  V04
......  

Royal  
Caribbean  >>ARG1
is  V01
better  V03
,  
but  
the  
best  
cruiseline  >ARG1
is  V01
Regent  
Seven  
Seas  <ARG2
.  

Look  V01
on  
their  
website  <ARG1
rssc.com  

Royal

Carnival  >>>ARG1
has  V01
been  V03
called  V01
the  
WalMart  <ARG2
of  
cruise  
lines  
...  

What  
countries  >ARG2
are  V01
the  
best  >ARG1
to  
travel  V01
to  <C-ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
want  V01
to  
travel  V01

Where  >ARG4
in  
the  
states  
could  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
go  V02

Where  
in  
Europe  
?  

Have  V01
you  >ARG0
every  >ARGM-TMP
traveled  V01

How  
long  >ARGM-TMP
should  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
go  V02
for  <C-ARGM-TMP
to  
each  
place  <ARG4
?  

(  
I  >ARG0
Have  V03
1  
year  <ARG1
before  
collage  <ARGM-TMP
!  
)  

&  >ARGM-DIS
Also  
how  
much  
money  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
need  V01
?  

So  >ARGM-DIS

saving  V03

Not  
the  
smartest  >ARGM-ADJ
move  V02
to  
take  V19
off

adventure  V01
if  
you  >>ARG0
've  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG

n't  >ARGM-NEG

where  >>ARG2
you  >>ARG0

be  V03

Lots

I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
spend  V02
a

in

alone  
.

I  >>>ARG0
've  V01
traveled  V01
to  
all  <ARG1
of  
these  
places  
and  
could  >ARGM-MOD
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
tailor  V01
a

to  
your  >ARG0

many

Do  V01
you  >>ARG0

to

all

simply  
a

on  
your  >ARG0
way  V01
to  
the  
next

Does  V01
your

to  
how  
long  >ARGM-EXT
you  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
stay  V01
in  
each

?  

You  >ARG0
need  V01
a  
lot  <ARG1

money  
for  
hotels  
,  
airfare  
,  
seeing  V01
the

Once  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
budget  <ARG1

an  
amount  
in

then  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >>>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD

figure  V05
out  
where  >ARG4
you  >ARG0

travelling  V01

You  >ARG0

n't  >ARGM-NEG
beat  V03
the  
price  V01
for  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
get  V01
.  

come  V01
to  
Africa  <ARG4
.  

Nigeria  
,  
a  
lovely

where  
in  
nigeria  
?

How  >>ARGM-MNR
do  V01
you  >ARG0
make  V02
your  
cat  >ARG1
adjust  V01
to  
a  
new  
house  <ARG2
?  

Me  >>ARG1
and  
my  
family  
are  V03
moving  V01
into  
a  
new  
house  <ARG2
just  
outside  
a  
small  
town  <ARGM-LOC
.  

We  >>ARG0
are  V03
currently  >ARGM-TMP
living  V01
a  
mile  <ARGM-LOC
from  
the  
town  
in  
a  
house  >ARG2
surrounded  V01
by  
fields  <ARG1
but  
the  
new  
house  >ARG1
is  V01
beside  
a  
busy  
road  <ARG2
.  

We  >>>ARG0
have  V01
had  V03
the  
cat  <ARG1
for  
10  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
leave  V15
it  <ARG1
.  

How  >ARGM-MNR
could  >ARGM-MOD
we  >ARG0
make  V02
it  >ARG1
settle  V03
in  
a  
new  
house  <ARGM-LOC
.  

you  >>ARG0
are  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADV
moving  V01
house  <ARG1
-  
your  
cat  >>ARG0
is  V03
losing  V02
his  
territory  <ARG1
.  

territory  >>ARG1
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
important  V01
to  
cats  <ARG2
,  
and  
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
nervous  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
go  V02
into  
a  
new  
place  <ARG4
-  
a  
new  
house  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
full  V01
of  
predators  <ARG2
,  
or  
unknown  
menaces  
-  
well  >ARGM-DIS
at  >ARGM-ADV
least  
he  >ARG0
thinks  V01
so  <ARG1
.  

you  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
to  
give  V01
him  >ARG0
only  
a  
small  
place  >ARG1
to  
explore  V01
,  
so  
he  >>>ARG1
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
make  V02
it  <ARG1
his  
territory  <ARG1
,  
and  
feel  V01
safe  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

then  >ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
a  
place  >ARGM-LOC
to  
retreat  V01
to  <C-ARGM-LOC
when  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG1
feels  V01
scared  V01
.  

you  >>>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
to  
get  V01
his  
box  <ARG1
and  
bowls  
,  
and  
whatever  
blanket  >>ARG1
and  
toys  
are  V01
his  <ARG2
,  
and  
smell  V02
like  
home  <ARG2
,  
and  
put  V01
him  <ARG1
in  
a  
room  <ARG2
.  

the  
room  >>>ARG1
you  >ARG0
sleep  V01
in  <C-ARGM-LOC
is  V01
best  V02
(  
seeing  V01
you  <ARG1
so  
relaxed  <ARG1
that  
you  >>ARG0
are  V03
sleeping  V01
will  >ARGM-MOD
send  V01
the  
message  <ARG1
that  
everything  >ARG1
is  V01
OK  <ARG2
)  
,  
but  
others  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
work  V09
just  
as  <ARGM-MNR
well  
.  

close  V01
the  
door  <ARG1
,  
and  
keep  V02
him  <ARG1
in  
there  <ARG2
for  
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
.  

he  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
feel  V01
much  >ARGM-CXN
safer  V01
in  
that  
one  
room  <ARGM-LOC
,  
than  
in  
a  
huge  
unknown  
house  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

he  >>>ARG0
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
explore  V01
the  
room  <ARG1
,  
mark  V02
everything  <ARG2
with  
his  
cheek  <ARG3
,  
and  
try  V01
to  
make  V02
it  >ARG1
feel  V01
like  
his  
territory  <ARGM-PRD
.  

he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
reassure  V01
himself  <ARG1
that  
no  
other  
animal  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
there  <ARG2
,  
and  
that  
no  
other  
animal  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
come  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
-  
he  >>ARG0
is  V01
afraid  V01
that  
he  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
someone  
else  
's  
territory  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
a  
new  
house  <ARG2
.  

in  
a  
week  
's  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
he  >>>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
made  V02
it  <ARG1
his  <ARG1
,  
and  
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
getting  V03
more  V01
bored  V08
than  
afraid  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

let  V01
him  <ARG1
out  <ARG1
for  
half  
an  
hour  <ARGM-TMP
,  
to  
explore  V01
.  

then  >ARGM-TMP
put  V01
him  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
in  <ARG2
.  

he  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
freaked  V02
out  
,  
so  >>ARGM-DIS
going  V02
back  <ARG4
to  
his  
territory  
will  >ARGM-MOD
make  V02
him  >ARG1
much  >ARGM-EXT
happier  V01
.  

extend  V01
the  
time  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG1
is  V01
out  <ARG2
each  
day  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
for  
the  
first  
month  >ARGM-TMP
,  
always  >ARGM-TMP
put  V01
him  <ARG1
in  
his  
room  <ARG2
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  
he  >>>ARG0
feels  V01
safe  V01
to  
sleep  V01
.  

soon  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
make  V02
the  
whole  
house  <ARG1
his  <ARG1
,  
but  
he  >>ARG0
needs  V01
that  
one  
safe  
place  >ARGM-DIR
to  
start  V06
from  <C-ARGM-DIR
.  

remember  V01
to  
visit  V02
with  
him  <ARG1
while  
he  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
the  
room  <ARG2
,  
and  
tell  V01
him  <ARG2
how  
good  >ARG2
he  >ARG1
is  V01
.  

remember  V01
to  
give  V01
him  <ARG2
the  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
needs  V01
to  
feel  V02
that  
the  
room  >ARG1
is  V01
his  <ARG2
-  
rush  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
he  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
afraid  V01
of  
the  
whole  
house  <ARG1
for  
a  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

he  >>ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
even  >ARGM-ADV
start  V01
peeing  V01
on  
things  <ARGM-LOC
in  
fear  V01
.  

good  
luck  
with  
your  
new  
house  
and  
with  
his  
new  
territory  
!  

Let  V01
her  >ARG0
explore  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG1
moved  V01
my  
cat  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
explore  V01
the  
entire  
house  <ARG1
before  
she  >ARG0
felt  V01
comfortable  <ARG1
.  

In  
time  >ARGM-TMP
though  >ARGM-ADV
she  >ARG0
/  
he  
will  >ARGM-MOD
adjust  V01
.  
:)  

they  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
do  V02
it  <ARG1
on  
their  
own  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
adopted  V01
a  
2  
year  
old  
male  
German  
Shepherd  <ARG1
with  
Major  
bad  
behaviors  
?  

Last  
night  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
adopted  V01
a  
2  
year  
old  
Male  
German  
Shepherd  <ARG1
.  

(  
He  >ARG1
is  V01
92  
pounds  <ARG2
)  
He  >>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
listen  V01
to  
any  
commands  <ARG1
,  
but  
my  
major  
problem  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
outside  <ARG4
on  
command  <ARGM-MNR
,  
or  
even  
with  
me  
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
walk  V01
outside  <ARG2
and  
he  >>>ARG0
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
stand  V01
at  
the  
door  <ARG2
and  
stare  V01
at  
me  <ARG1
or  
run  V02
away  <ARGM-DIR
.  

My  
other  
MAJOR  
problem  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
he  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
get  V05
in  
his  
crate  <ARG2
.  

I  >>>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
get  V01
a  
treat  <ARG1
and  
try  V01
to  
get  V04
him  <ARG1
in  
there  <ARG1
that  
way  V01
,  
it  >ARG1
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
work  V09
.  

He  >ARG1
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
get  V05
close  <ARG2
to  
the  
crate  
.  

If  
I  >ARG1
come  V01
towards  
him  <ARGM-DIR
,  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
run  V02
away  <ARGM-DIR
.  

How  >>ARGM-MNR
do  V01
I  >ARG0
train  V01
him  <ARG2
to  
feel  V01
comfortable  <ARG1
in  
his  
crate  <ARGM-LOC
?  

and  
to  
willingly  >ARGM-MNR
go  V02
outside  <ARG4
...  
and  
to  
come  V01
on  
command  <ARGM-ADV
.  

He  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
anything  <ARG1
on  
command  <ARGM-CAU
.  

It  >ARG1
s  V01
very  
frustrating  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
9  
month  
old  
German  
Shepherd  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
raised  V03
from  
a  
puppy  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
trained  V01
her  <ARG2
myself  <ARGM-REC
.  

She  >>>ARG1
is  V01
crate  
trained  <ARG2
,  
potty  
trained  
,  
and  
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
sit  V01
,  
lay  V01
down  <ARGM-DIR
,  
stay  V01
,  
come  V01
,  
fetch  V01
,  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
even  >ARGM-ADV
stay  V01
in  
a  
down  
position  <ARG3
while  
I  >ARG0
throw  V01
a  
treat  <ARG1
across  
the  
floor  <ARG2
or  
even  
right  
next  
to  
her  
paw  
,  
and  
she  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
it  <ARG1
until  
I  >>ARG0
give  VLV
her  >ARG1
the  
command  V02
.  

Yes  
,  
lots  
of  
time  
and  
lots  
of  
patients  
...  

I  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
do  V02
it  <ARG1
with  
a  
grown  
dog  <ARG4
.  

She  >ARG0
tosses  V01
me  <ARG1
around  <ARGM-DIR
like  
it  >ARG1
s  V01
nothing  <ARG2
!  

...  
but  >>ARGM-DIS
basically  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
do  V02
is  V01
the  
same  
thing  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
did  V02
with  
my  
puppy  <ARG2
...  
lots  
of  
patience  
,  
lots  
of  
time  
,  
lots  
of  
praise  V01
,  
lots  
of  
treats  
,  
and  
lots  
of  
repition  V01
....  
Right  <<<ARGM-DIS
?  

Is  V02
there  
any  
tricks  V01
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
use  V01
?  

Maybe  >ARGM-ADV
get  V01
a  
book  <ARG1
on  
training  V01
.  

You  >>ARG1
have  V02
to  
be  V01
in  
command  <ARG2
at  
all  
times  <ARGM-TMP
.  

There  
are  V02
ways  V01
to  
get  V04
your  
new  
dog  >>ARG0
used  V02
to  
the  
crate  <ARG1
or  
going  V02
out  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
start  V01
with  
a  
leash  <ARG2
.  

Put  V01
the  
leash  <ARG1
on  
the  
dog  <ARG2
and  
just  >ARGM-ADV
walk  V01
around  
the  
crate  <ARG2
a  
few  
times  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Then  >>ARGM-TMP
take  V07
the  
leash  <ARG1
off  <C-V
and  
do  V02
nothing  <ARG1
else  
but  
that  
.  

Later  >ARGM-TMP
do  V02
it  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
the  
dog  >ARG1
is  V01
ok  >>>ARGM-TMP
with  
this  
,  
then  >>>ARGM-TMP
open  V01
the  
door  <ARG1
and  
walk  V01
around  
the  
crate  <ARG2
,  
leave  V14
the  
door  >ARG1
open  V01
all  
the  
time  <<ARGM-TMP

Put  V01
something  <ARG1
fun  
inside  <ARG2
.  

Let  V01
your  
dog  >ARG0
go  V02
in  <ARG4
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
wants  V01
to  <ARG1
for  
no  
reason  <ARG1
.  

Do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
shut  V01
the

Let  V01
him  >ARG0
walk  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
and  
out  
for  
a  
few  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

At  
some  
point  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
feel  V01
ok  <ARG1
with  
this  
and  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
then  >ARGM-TMP
close  V01
the  
door  <ARG1
but  
not  
for  
long  
at  
all  
.  

Open  V01
the  
door  <ARG1
and  
let  V01
him  <ARG1
out  <ARG1
and  
see  V01
how  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
acts  V01
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
push  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
work  V09
.  

With  
going  V02
outside  <ARG4
,  
put  V01
the  
leash  <ARG1
on  <ARG2
and  
just  >ARGM-ADV
take  V01
him  <ARG1
for  
a  
walk  V01
.  

He  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
learn  V01
to  
really  >ARGM-EXT
like  V01
this  <ARG1
.  

Potty  >ARG1
outside  
will  >ARGM-MOD
come  V01
at  
some  
point  <ARGM-TMP

Try  V01
obedience  
classes  <ARG1
.  

Have  V03
patience  <ARG1
with  
him  
,  
you  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
got  V01
him  <ARG1
and  
who  >ARG0
knows  V01
how  >>ARG2
he  >>ARG1
was  V03
treated  V01
before  
you  >ARG0
brought  V01
him  <ARG1
home  <ARG2
.  

where  >ARGM-LOC
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
find  V01
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
tours  V01
to  
the  
Mekong  
Delta  <ARG1
at  
reasonable  >ARGM-ADJ
prices  V01
?  

will  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
be  V01
in  
Ho  
chi  
Minh  <ARG2
for  
4  
days  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >>ARGM-MOD
am  V03
looking  V01
for  
a  
1  
day  >ARGM-TMP
or  
2  
day  
trip  V03
to  
Mekong  
delta  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
researching  V01
on  
line  <ARGM-MNR
and  
find  V01
things  >ARG1
are  V01
quite  
pricey  <ARG2
but  
the  
tours  V01
look  V02
great  V01
.  

Should  >>ARGM-MOD
I  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
settle  V01
and  
book  V03
on  
line  <ARGM-MNR
?  

or  >>ARGM-DIS
is  V01
it  >ARG1
better  V02
if  
I  >ARG1
wait  V01
till  
I  >ARG1
get  V05
there  <ARG2
?  

If  
I  >ARG1
wait  V01
,  
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
the  
tours  V01
I  >ARG0
find  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
for  
less  
money  <ARGM-ADV
be  V01
the  
same  
quality  
type  >ARGM-ADJ
tours  V01
?  

Also  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
any  
tour  >ARG1
recommendations  V01
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful  V04
a  
well  <ARGM-DIS

I  >>>ARG0

a  
home  >ARG3
stay  V01
that  >>R-ARG1
was  V01
sweet  V05

the

wonderful  V03
.  

I  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
remember  V01
the  
exact  
cost  <ARG1

remember  V01

And  >>ARGM-DIS
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
expect  V01

on  
this  
tour  V01

The

Very

,  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
lifestyle  <ARG2
not  
a

If  
you  >>ARG1

You  >>>ARG0

biking  V01
,  
eating  V01
at  
a  
local

and  
doing  V02
other  
things  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are  V03
geared  V01
towards  
tourists  <ARG2
.  

The  
countryside  >>ARG1
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
beautiful  V02
,  
especially  
if  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
few  
months  >ARGM-TMP
(  
or  
years

to

from  
Cho

It  >>ARG1
's  V01
a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
hard  V02
to  
get  V05
to  <ARG2
by  
foot  <ARGM-MNR
,  
they  >>ARG0
're  V03
rebuilding  V01
the

get  V04
someone  >ARG0
to  
moto  >ARGM-MNR
-  
taxi  V01
you  <ARG1
there  <ARG3
for  
a

He  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
set  V03
up  
a  
real  >ARGM-ADJ
tour  V01
of  
the  
area  <ARG1
for

,  
not  
some

Have  VLV
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
trip  V03
where  
-  
ever  >ARG2
you  >ARG1
end  V03
up  
.  

We  >ARG0
went  V02
with  
Intrepid  <ARGM-COM
as  
a  
part  <ARGM-PRD
of  
their  >ARG0
North  
to

Vietnam  >ARG1
Trip  V03
,  
but  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
offer  V01
this  
one  
day  <ARG1
separately  <ARGM-MNR
.  

We  >>>ARG0
had  V03
a  
great  
time  <ARG1
and  
visited  V01
a  
location  >ARGM-LOC
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
they  >ARG0
made  V01
coconut  
candies  <ARG1
,  
visited  V01
a  
local  
restaurant  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
was  V03
attached  V01
to  
a  
fish  
farm  <ARG2
,  
rode  V01
in  
modified  
quad  
bikes  <ARG1
and  
had  V03
some  
tropical  
food  <ARG1
at  
what  >>ARG1
appeared  V02
to  
be  V01
a  
local  
hangout  <ARG2
.  

Intrepid  >>ARG1
is  V01
good  V03
at  
getting  V05
you  <ARG1
away  <ARG2
from  
the  
most  
touristy  
spots  
and  
showing  V01
you  <ARG2
something  <ARG1
a  
little  
different  
.  

yoga  
and  
horses  
.....  
?  

I  >ARG0
got  V01
a  
riding  >ARG1
lesson  V01
today  <<ARGM-TMP
on  
one  <<ARGM-LOC
of  
my  
boss  
's  
fino  
horses  
and  
it  >ARG0
made  V02
me  >ARG0
realize  V01
just  
how  
unsteady  >ARG2
my  
left  
leg  >ARG1
is  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
mentioned  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
my  
boss  <ARG2
and  
she  >>>ARG0
said  V01
to  
start  V01
doing  VLV
yoga  V01
.  

But  
there  
are  V02
just  
so  
many  
poses  <ARG1
and  
programs  
!  

Any  
good  
poses  >>>ARG0
or  
programs  
(  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
willing  V02
to  
buy  V01
a  
dvd  <ARG1
as  
long  <<<ARGM-ADV
as  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
under  
$  <ARG2
20  
)  
to  
help  V01
specifically  <ARGM-ADV
with  
leg  >ARG1
stabilization  V01
?  

I  >>>ARG0
just  >>>ARGM-DIS
have  VLV
a  
few  >ARGM-ADJ
issues  V02
supporting  V01
my  
back  <ARG1
and  
my  
left  
leg  >ARG1
flops  V01
.  

Because  
I  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
feel  V01
like  
spending  V01
over  
$  <ARG3
20  
on  
a  
freakin  
DVD  <ARG1

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
have  V03
back  
problems  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
transfer  V01
into  
my  
legs  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
done  V02
Yoga  <ARG1
for  
riders  
for  
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
,  
a  
20  
minute  
routine  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
found  V01
on  
YouTube  <ARGM-LOC
(  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
it  >>ARG1
s  V03
called  V01
"  
Yoga  >>ARG1
for  
horse  
back  >ARG1
riding  V01
"  
hosted  V01
by  
a  
man  <ARG0
)  
It  >ARG0
helped  V01
with  
noticing  V01
slight  >ARGM-EXT
differences  V02
in  
my  
balance  <ARG1
and  
weight  >ARG1
distribution  V01
but  
not  
really  
for  
the  
way  >ARGM-MNR
I  >ARG0
use  V01
my  
legs  <ARG1
and  
back  
.  

Here  >ARG2
is  V01
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
do  V02
now  <ARGM-TMP
and  
it  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
helps  V01
....  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>>ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
get  V05
on  <ARGM-DIR
I  >>ARG0
take  V01
1  
leg  <ARG1
and  
pull  V01
it  <ARG1
back  
up  <ARG2
to  
touch  V01
my  
butt  <ARG1
with  
my  
heel  <ARG2
and  
hold  V01
it  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
for  
1  
lap  <ARGM-TMP
at  
a  
walk  V01
around  
a  
large  
dressage  
arena  <ARG2
.  

Then  
the  
same  
thing  
with  
the  
other  
leg  
.  

Then  
1  
lap  
at  
a  
walk  V01
around  
the  
arena  
with  
both  
my  
legs  >ARG1
pulled  V01
out  <ARG2
as  
far  <ARG3
as  
I  
can  
,  
so  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
touching  V01
the  
saddle  <ARG1
.  

Then  
a  
lap  
doing  
scissors  
,  
one  
leg  
forward  
as  
far  
as  
I  
can  
and  
the  
other  
back  
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
switch  V01
legs  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-ADV
trot  V01
doing  V02
,  
down  >ARGM-DIR
2  
beats  V02
,  
up  
one  
for  
a  
wile  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
then  
up  
2  
down  
1  
making  V02
sure  V01
the  
weight  >>ARG1
is  V03
going  V01
into  
the  
balls  <ARG4
of  
my  
feet  
.  

If  
the  
weight  >>ARG1
is  V03
going  V01
into  
your  
heels  <ARG4
(  
it  >ARG0
throws  V01
your  
leg  <ARG1
forward  <ARG2
)  
put  V01
the  
stirrups  <ARG1
up  
against  
the  
heel  <ARG2
of  
your  
boot  
.  

Do  VLV
a  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
working  >ARGM-PRD
trot  V01
,  
not  
a  
slow  
trot  
.  

All  
this  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
help  V01
you  >>>ARG0
use  V01
both  
legs  <ARG1
evenly  <ARGM-MNR
,  
keep  VLV
proper  >ARGM-MNR
contact  V01
and  
use  V01
your  
wight  <ARG1
correctly  <ARGM-MNR
,  
to  
keep  V02
your  
leg  <ARG1
in  
a  
good  
position  <ARG2
.  

BTW  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
your  
leg  >ARG1
locked  V01
in  
place  <ARGM-LOC
,  
it  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
move  V01
WITH  
the  
horse  <ARGM-MNR
a  
bit  <ARGM-EXT
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
started  V01
doing  V02
it  <ARG1
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
it  <ARG1
every  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
do  V02
it  <ARG1
once  <ARGM-TMP
or  
twice  
a  
week  
or  
as  
needed  V01
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
not  
only  >ARGM-NEG
is  V01
my  
leg  >ARG1
better  V05
,  
but  
my  
back  >>ARG1
is  V03

.

having  V03
problems  <ARG1

want  V01
to  
spend  V01
more  
than  
$  <ARG3
20  
and  
yet  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
an  
expensive  
hobby  <ARG1
like  
riding  V01
horses  <ARG1
?  

I  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
help  V01
you  <ARG1
.  

What  >ARG1
to  
feed  V01
my  
dog  <ARG2
after  
gastroenteritis  <ARGM-TMP
?  

My  
dog  >>>ARG1
has  V01
been  V01
sick  V05
for  
about  
3  
days  <ARGM-TMP
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >>>ARG0
has  V01
been  V03
having  V03
diarheya  <ARG1
everywhere  <ARGM-LOC
and  
he  >>ARG0
began  V02
to  
vomit  V01
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
thought  V01
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
pass  V03
until  
he  >>ARG0
started  V01
to  
vomit  V01
blood  <ARG1
and  
would  
nt  
drink  
any  
water  
.  

I  >ARG0
took  V01
him  <ARG1
to  
the  
Animal  
Hospital  <ARG3
and  
they  >ARG0
ran  V01
blood  >ARG1
work  V01
and  
everything  >>ARG1
came  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
normal  V02
.  

No  
pancreatitis  
or  
anything  
abnormal  
.  

The  
vet  >ARG0
said  V01
it  >>ARG0
was  V01
gastroenteritis  <ARG2
and  
gave  V01
him  <ARG2
fluids  <ARG1
under  
his  
skin  
,  
an  
injection  V01
of  
nausea  >ARG3
medication  V01
along  
with  
some  
take  V01
home  <ARG3
antibiotics  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
my  
question  >ARG1
is  V01
..  

Is  V01
it  <ARG1
normal  V02
for  
dogs  >>ARG0
to  
throw  V05
up  
blood  <ARG1
while  
having  V03
gastroenteritis  <ARG1
?  

and  >ARGM-DIS
will  >ARGM-MOD
these  
antibiotics  >ARG0
help  V01
?  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
tryed  V01
to  
give  V01
him  <ARG2
water  <ARG1
but  
he  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
take  V01
it  <ARG1
..  
what  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
i  >ARG0
do  V02
?  

i  >>ARG0
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
him  >ARG1
to  
get  V03
dehydrated  <ARG2
and  
also  
should  >ARGM-MOD
i  >>ARG0
try  V01
to  
give  V01
him  <ARG2
a  
little  
bit  <ARG1
of  
food  
?  

...  
Some  
help  V01
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
great  V01
.  

thank  V01
you  <ARG1
:)  

They  >>>ARG0
did  V01
nt  >>>ARGM-NEG
take  VLV
x  V01
-  
rays  >C-V
they  >ARG0
offered  V01
them  <ARG1
but  
i  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
could  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
afford  V01
any  
more  >ARGM-EXT
treatment  V03
.  

I  >ARG0
feel  V01
like  
shit  <ARG1
for  
saying  V01
that  <ARG1
but  
after  
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
have  V01
done  V08
already  <ARGM-TMP
i  >>ARG0
wo  >>ARGM-MOD
nt  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
buying  V01
grocerys  <ARG1
for  
the  
next  
few  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>>ARG0
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
give  VLV
them  >ARG2
and  
call  V02
and  
see  V01
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
say  V01
.  

Thank  V01
you  <ARG1
for  
the  
help  V01
.  

Ok  
so  >ARGM-DIS
i  >ARG0
spoke  V01
to  
the  
vet  <ARG2
and  
he  >ARG0
said  V01
the  >ARG0
give  V01
him  <ARG2
white  
rice  <ARG1
and  
boiled  
chicken  
but  
only  
a  
little  
at  
a  
time  
.  

Seince  
he  >ARG0
recieved  V01
the  
fluids  <ARG1
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
said  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
worry  V02
about  
drinking  
water  <ARG1
for  
at  
least  
a  
couple  <ARGM-TMP
of  
days  
.  

I  >>ARG0
went  V02
home  <ARG4
at  
lunch  <ARGM-TMP
to  
check  V01
on  
him  <ARG1
and  
he  >>ARG0
is  V03
doing  V02
1000  
etter  <ARGM-MNR
he  >>>ARG0
was  V03
actually  >ARGM-ADV
walkin  V01
around  <ARGM-DIR
and  
wagin  V01
his  
tail  <ARG1
:)  
thanks  V01
everbody  <ARGM-DIS
for  
the  
info  <ARG2
it  >>ARG1
s  V03
greatly  >ARGM-ADV
appreciated  V02
.  

To  
answer  V01
your  
questions  <ARG1
in  
order  V03
:  

1  
)  
It  
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
normal  V02
for  
dogs  >>>ARG0
to  
be  V03
vomiting  V01
,  
much  
less  >ARGM-EXT
to  
have  V03
blood  <ARG1
in  
it  <ARGM-LOC
.  

However  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
they  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
vomiting  V01
numerous  
times  <ARGM-TMP
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
the  
blood  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
due  
to  
irritation  V01
of  
the  
stomach  <ARG1
and  
intestines  
.  

He  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
have  V03
Parvovirus  <ARG1
,  
a  
GI  
foreign  
body  
,  
or  
any  
number  
of  
things  
.  

Did  V01
your  
vet  >>ARG0
take  VLV
radiographs  V01
(  
x  V_
-  
rays  >C-V
)  
?  

2  
)  
Your  
vet  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
prescribe  V02
them  <ARG1
if  
they  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
it  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
helpful  V04
.  

3  
)  
If  
he  >>ARG1
shows  V01
no  >ARGM-NEG
interest  V01
in  
water  <ARG2
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
take  V01
him  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
to  
your  
vet  
.  

It  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
due  
to  
nausea  <ARG2
or  
any  
number  
of  
things  
.  

He  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
become  V01
severly  
dehydrated  <ARG2
(  
especially  
if  
he  >>>ARG0
continues  V01
to  
vomit  V01
and  
have  V03
diarrhea  <ARG1
)  
.  

From  
there  >ARGM-DIR
you  >ARG1
end  V03
up  
with  
electrolyte  
imbalances  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
lead  V03
to  
heart  
and  
kidney  
problems  <ARG2
.  

And  >>>ARGM-DIS
being  V01
dehydrated  >>>ARG1
,  
vomiting  V01
,  
and  
having  V03
diarrhea  <ARG1
just  >>>ARGM-ADV
does  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
feel  V01
good  V02
.  

4  
)  
Call  V02
your  
vet  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
discussed  V01
a  
bland  >ARGM-ADJ
diet  V01
with  
you  <<ARG2
,  
including  
the  
frequency  <<ARGM-ADV
of  
feeding  V01
and  
how  
much  >ARGM-EXT
to  
feed  V01
at  
each  
sitting  V01
.  

It  >ARG1
sounds  V01
like  
your  
dog  >>>ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
benefit  V01
from  
being  V03
hospitalized  V01
,  
and  
put  V03
on  
IV  
fluids  >>>ARG0
to  
help  V01
his  >ARG1
hydration  V01
,  
administer  V01
the  
antibiotics  
IV  <ARG1
,  
and  
to  
ensure  V01
that  
he  >>ARG1
starts  V01
to  
recover  V01
.  

You  >>ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
ABSOLUTELY  >ARGM-ADV
call  V02
your  
veterinarian  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
immediately  <ARGM-TMP
to  
clarify  V10
anything  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
have  VLV
questions  V01
about  <C-ARG1
.  

They  >>>ARG0
have  V01
seen  V01
your  
pet  <ARG1
,  
and  
are  V01
most  >ARGM-ADV
aware  V01
of  
his  
condition  <ARG1
.  

No  
one  >>>ARG0
online  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
assist  V01
you  <ARG1
more  <ARGM-EXT
than  
your  
vet  
can  
.  

You  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
ask  V01
your  
vet  <ARG2
these  
questions  <ARG1
.  

Boiled  
WHITE  
rice  
and  
boiled  
chicken  
breast  
.  

Bland  
food  
.  

NO  
SPICES  
!  

My  
vet  >ARG0
told  V01
me  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
dog  >>ARG0
is  V03
vomiting  V01
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT
,  
it  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
sign  V07
of  
obstruction  V01
.  

Did  V01
they  >>ARG0
do  VLV
any  
x  V_
-  
rays  >C-V
?  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
if  
vomiting  V01
blood  <ARG1
is  V01
common  V01
with  
this  
ailment  <ARG2
.  

You  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
call  V02
your  
vet  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
and  
ask  V01
them  <ARG2
what  >>ARG1
is  V01
normal  V02
or  
not  
.  

French  
dating  
etiquette  
?  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
really  >ARGM-ADV
love  V02
to  
hear  V01
what  >>>ARG1
the  
French  >>>ARG0
or  
those  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
had  V01
dated  V02
the  
French  <ARG1
to  
say  V01
something  
about  
this  
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
in  
my  
20's  <ARG2
and  
currently  >ARGM-TMP
studying  V01
in  
France  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Coming  V01
from  
an  
anglo  
-  
saxon  
country  <ARG3
my  
version  >>ARG1
of  
dating  V02
is  V01
'  
getting  V01
the  
number  <ARG1
,  
asking  V04
her  <ARG1
out  <C-V
,  
etc.  
.  
'  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
read  V01
on  
the  
internet  <ARGM-LOC
that  
the  
French  
dating  
etiquette  >>ARG1
is  V01
totally  >ARGM-EXT
different  V02
.  

For  
them  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
dating  V02
would  >ARGM-MOD
normally  >ARGM-ADV
be  V01
meeting  V02
in  
groups  <ARGM-MNR
or  
parties  V01
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
pairing  V03
off  
.  

In  
addition  V02
,  
from  
my  >ARG0
understanding  V01
one  
-  
on  
-  
one  
dates  >ARG1
is  V01
something  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
comes  V01
much  
later  <ARGM-TMP
and  
not  
'  
straight  
-  
away  
'  
like  
us  
anglo  
-  
saxons  
.  

They  >ARG1
are  V01
also  <ARGM-ADV
very  
secretive  <ARG2
about  
being  V01
in  
a  
relationship  V03
.  

They  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
'  
go  V02
out  <ARGM-DIR
in  
the  
open  <ARG4
'  
once  
they  >>ARG0
have  V01
reached  V01
a  
certain  
level  <ARG1
of  
seriousness  
.  

Is  V01
it  >ARG1
true  V01
?  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
told  V01
a  
French  
girl  <ARG2
I  >ARG0
liked  V01
her  <ARG1
,  
and  
she  >ARG0
accepted  V01
.  

She  >>ARG1
is  V01
friendly  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
see  V01
each  
other  <ARG1
on  
campus  <ARGM-LOC
.  

She  >>ARG1
is  V01
also  >ARGM-ADV
nicer  V01
when  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG1
are  V01
both  <ARGM-ADV
alone  V01
.  

However  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG1
are  V01
at  
parties  V01
or  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  
are  V02
people  <ARG1
around  
she  >>ARG0
seems  V01
to  
ignore  V01
me  <ARG1
.  

She  >>ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
seems  V01
to  
hate  V01
it  <ARG1
whenever  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
ask  V04
her  <ARG1
out  <C-V
on  
a  
date  <ARG2
,  
to  
the  
point  >ARGM-ADV
she  >ARG0
said  V01
stop  V01
!  

My  
mind  >ARG0
thinks  V01
she  >>>ARG0
has  V03
no  >ARGM-NEG
interest  V01
in  
me  <ARG2
and  
just  >ARGM-ADV
stringing  V01
me  <ARG1
along  <ARGM-PRD
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIR
the  
articles  >>>ARG0
I  >ARG0
read  V01
seemed  V01
to  
say  V01
the  
contrary  <ARG1
.  

Have  V01
I  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-ADV
fallen  V07
victim  <ARG2
in  
a  
cultural  
trap  <ARGM-LOC
?  

What  >>>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
have  V01
read  V01
in  
the  
internet  <ARGM-LOC
is  V01
fairly  >ARGM-EXT
accurate  V01
but  
of  >>ARGM-ADV
course  
it  >>ARG1
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
fit  V01
all  
scenarios  <ARG2
.  

You  >ARG1
are  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
French  <ARG2
for  
a  
start  V01
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
"  
rules  V01
"  
or  
"  
customs  
"  
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
apply  V02
to  
you  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
it  
comes  V12
to  
entering  V01
into  
a  
relationship  V03
between  
people  <ARG0
from  
different  
backgrounds  
.  

From  
what  >>>ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
say  V01
the  
messages  >>>ARG1
given  V01
by  
this  
girl  <ARG0
are  V01
quite  >ARGM-EXT
clear  V06
.  

She  >>ARG0
is  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
stringing  V01
you  <ARG1
along  <ARGM-PRD
since  
she  >>>ARG0
is  V03
actually  >ARGM-ADV
discouraging  V01
you  <ARG1
and  
is  V01
honest  V01
enough  V01
to  
tell  V01
you  >>ARG0
to  
stop  V01
asking  V04
her  <ARG1
out  <C-V
.  

She  >>>ARG1
is  V03
just  >>ARGM-ADV
being  V01
friendly  V01
in  
public  <ARGM-LOC
because  
she  >>>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
offend  V01
you  <ARG1
and  
she  >ARG0
treats  V01
you  <ARG1
like  
any  
other  
friend  <ARG2
.  

You  >ARG0
said  V01
you  >ARG0
liked  V01
her  <ARG1
and  
she  >ARG0
accepted  V01
it  <ARG1
as  
a  
truth  <ARG3
and  
perhaps  
as  
a  
compliment  
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
mean  V01
she  >>>ARG0
fancies  V02
you  <ARG1
or  
wants  V01
to  
pair  V03
off  
with  
you  <ARG1
.  

At  
parties  V01
she  >>>ARG1
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
be  V03
considered  V01
in  
any  
way  V01
attached  V01
to  
you  <ARG2
,  
which  >>ARG1
is  V01
consistent  V01
.  

Take  V04
the  
messages  <ARG1
for  
what  >ARG2
they  >ARG1
are  V01
:  
she  >ARG0
has  V03
no  
objection  V01
in  
you  >ARG1
being  V01
pals  <ARG2
at  
uni  
,  
but  
she  >>>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
take  V01
matters  <ARG1
further  <ARG3
.  

"  
Non  >ARG1

"  
non  <ARG2
"  
,  
not  
"  
I  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
consider  V02
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
keep  V02
you  >ARG1
attached  V01
to  
my  
apron  
strings  <ARG2
just  
in  <<ARGM-ADV
case  
.  
"  

Christiane  
gave  VLV
you  
a  
good  >ARGM-MNR
answer  V01
.  

You  >>ARG1
have  V01
fallen  V01
in  
a  
cultural  >ARG3
misunderstanding  V01
.  

What  >>>ARG1
I  >ARG0
have  V03
to  
add  V01
is  V01
that  
it  
is  V01
normal  V02
in  
France  <ARGM-LOC
to  
have  V03
mixed  V01
gender  
groups  <ARG1
of  
friends  
,  
there  
's  V02
nothing  <ARG1
unusual  
in  
boys  >ARG1
and  
girls  
being  V01
only  
friends  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
obviously  <ARGM-ADV
what  >ARG1
this  
girl  >ARG0
wants  V01
from  
you  <ARG4
.  

She  >ARG0
probably  >ARGM-ADV
finds  V02
your  
company  <ARG1
pleasing  <ARG1
as  
a  
friend  <ARGM-PRD
but  
you  >ARG1
are  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
her  >ARG0
choice  V01
a  
a  
boyfriend  <ARG1
and  
she  >>>ARG0
is  V03
trying  V01
to  
keep  V02
it  <ARG1
on  
a  
friendship  
level  <ARG2
,  
and  
trying  V01
to  
make  V02
you  >ARG0
understand  V01
that  
she  >>>ARG0
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
go  V02
further  <ARGM-PRD
.  

If  
she  >>ARG1
is  V01
nicer  V01
when  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >>ARG1
are  V01
alone  V01
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
it  >ARG1
is  V01
because  
in  
public  >ARG0
view  V02
she  >>>ARG0
is  V03
making  V02
sure  V01
that  
people  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
that  
you  >ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
her  
boyfriend  <ARG2
.  

You  >>ARG0
do  V01
find  V01
the  
'  
get  V01
the  
number  <ARG1
hop  V01
in  
bed  <ARG4
with  
her  <ARGM-COM
'  
but  
be  V01
aware  V01
that  
they  >ARG0
usually  >ARGM-TMP
have  V03
a  
reputation  <ARG1
as  
sluts  
.  

Unfair  
for  
the  
girl  
as  
boys  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
that  
kind  <ARG1
of  
handicap  
,  
but  
that  >ARG1
's  V01
the  
way  V01
our  
own  
rules  >ARG0
work  V01
.  

Should  
have  V01
done  VLV
research  V01
before  
you  >ARG0
left  V11
.  

Why  >>>ARGM-CAU
not  >>>ARGM-NEG
just  >>>ARGM-ADV
take  VLV
your  >ARG0
chances  V02
and  
do  V02
it  <ARG1
your  >ARG0
way  V01
?  

True  
or  
false  
:  
being  V01
a  
young  
New  
Zealander  >ARG1
means  V01
having  V03
no  
future  <ARG1
?  

There  
are  V02
no  
jobs  <ARG1
in  
this  
country  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>>ARG0
'm  V03
just  >ARGM-ADV
trying  V01
to  
make  V08
up  
my  
mind  <ARG1
whether  
I  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
move  V01
to  
Australia  <ARG2
or  
seek  V01
work  V01
in  
the  
sex  
industry  <<ARG2
.  

Is  V02
there  
a  
future  <ARG1
for  
our  
nation  
's  
youth  
?  

@  
Ryan  
B  
,  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01
two  
years  
into  
an  
undergraduate  
degree  <ARG2
.  

Everybody  >>>ARG1
I  >ARG0
know  V02
at  
university  
intends  V01
to  
stay  V01
at  
uni  <ARG3
for  
as  
long  <ARGM-TMP
as  
possible  <ARGM-TMP
until  
there  
are  V02
actually  <ARGM-ADV
jobs  <ARG1
available  
.  

Everybody  >>>ARG1
seems  V01
to  
flee  V05
this  
country  <ARG1
and  
move  V01
overseas  <ARG2
,  
to  
Australia  
,  
etc  
.  

There  
's  V02
obviously  <ARGM-ADV
a  
reason  <ARG1
for  
that  
(  
lack  V01
of  
employment  V01
,  
low  
incomes  
,  
etc  
.  
)  

Your  >ARG0
answer  V01
does  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
do  V02
anything  <ARG1
but  
remind  V01
me  <ARG2
that  
I  >>>ARG1
'm  V03
going  V04
to  
be  V01
$  
25,000  
in  
debt  <ARG2
by  
the  
time  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
'm  V01
22  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
,  
thanks  V01
.  

@  
W.a.b.b.y  
,  

I  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
like  V01
you're  >ARG0
answer  V01
.  

it  >>ARG1
's  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
logical  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG1
've  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
considered  V02
becoming  V01
a  
teacher  <ARG2
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
job  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG2
'm  V03
cut  V09
out  
for  <C-ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIR
wish  V01
I  >>ARG0
'd  V01
applied  V01
for  
a  
scholarship  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
I  >>ARG2
'd  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
awarded  V01
one  <ARG1
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
received  V01
the  
Dux  
Litterarum  >ARG1
award  V01
at  
high  
school  <<ARGM-LOC
,  
so  >>>ARGM-ADV
my  >ARG0
chances  V02
were  V01
probably  >ARGM-ADV
better  V02
than  
I  >ARG0
thought  V01
they  >ARG1
were  V01
.  

Obviously  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
still  >ARGM-TMP
completely  >ARGM-EXT
stupid  V01
though  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
mean  V01
,  
I  >>>ARG0
was  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
smart  V06
enough  <ARGM-CXN
to  
apply  V01
for  
a  
scholarship  <ARG1
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG1
am  V03
being  V01
melodramatic  <ARG2
.  

Lol  
.  

@  
Hatmanone  
,  

*  
gasps  V01
*  
So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
make  V06
a  
good  
prostitute  <ARG2
?  

Are  V03
you  >ARG0
saying  V01
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
bad  V02
in  
bed  <ARG2
?  

How  >ARGM-MNR
would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
know  V01
?  

Joking  V01
.  

Your  >ARG0
answer  V01
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
sweet  V03
,  
but  
I  >ARG1
'm  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
compassionate  <ARG2
towards  
teenage  
high  
school  
students  
.  

A  
little  
mellow  
dramatic  
?  

In  
my  
opinion  >ARGM-ADV
,  
far  
too  
many  
people  >>ARG0
are  V01
at  
university  <ARG2
studying  V01
worthless  
degrees  <ARG1
.  

Yes  >>>ARGM-DIS
things  >>>ARG1
like  
philosophy  
and  
fashion  >ARG1
design  V01
are  V01
interesting  V01
,  
but  
how  
many  
jobs  >ARG1
are  V01
out  
there  <ARG2
for  
someone  <ARGM-ADV
with  
these  
qualifications  V02
?  

I  >>>ARG1
'm  V03
studying  V01
to  
be  V01
a  
teacher  <ARG2
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
know  V01
that  
there  
will  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
be  V02
jobs  <ARG1
out  
there  <ARGM-LOC
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
done  V08
.  

I  >>ARG0
may  
have  V02
to  
live  V01
somewhere  <ARGM-LOC
rural  
or  
in  
Auckland  
,  
but  
at  >>ARGM-ADV
least  
I  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
pretty  >ARGM-ADV
sure  V02
I  >ARG1
'll  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
employable  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
've  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
got  V01
a  
bachelor  
s  
degree  <ARG1
so  >>>ARGM-ADV
I  >>>ARG0
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
go  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
and  
do  VLV
further  >ARGM-EXT
study  V01
or  
take  V01
a  
different  
profession  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
know  V01
that  
you  >>>ARG2
do  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
get  V03
paid  V01
that  
much  
more  <ARG1
in  
Australia  <ARGM-LOC
than  
you  
do  V01
here  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
it  >ARG1
's  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
all  
about  
how  
much  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
earn  V01
,  
cost  >>>ARG1
of  
living  V01
is  V01
much  >ARGM-EXT
higher  V02
in  
many  
cities  <ARGM-LOC
in  
Australia  
.  

Try  V01
living  V01
in  
Sydney  <ARGM-LOC
on  
a  
teacher  
's  
salary  <ARGM-MNR
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
compare  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
somewhere  <ARG2
like  
Central  
Otago  
.  

You  >>ARG0
also  
have  V02
to  
put  V12
up  
with  
all  
the  
annoying  
accents  <ARG1
in  
Australia  
.  

It  
's  V01
probably  <ARGM-ADV
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
wise  
idea  <ARG2
to  
keep  V02
studying  V01
and  
having  V03
a  
massive  >ARGM-ADJ
student  >ARG2
loan  V01
.  

At  
the  
moment  >ARGM-TMP
there  
's  V02
no  >ARGM-NEG
interest  V01
,  
but  
that  >ARG1
'll  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
change  V01
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
add  V02
interest  <ARG1
to  
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
've  V01
already  >ARGM-TMP
racked  V01
up  
.  

And  
they  >>>ARG0
're  V03
working  V06
towards  
being  V01
able  V01
to  
extradite  V01
people  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
have  V01
left  V11
the  
country  <ARG1
to  
avoid  V01
paying  V01
it  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
.  

At  
the  
moment  >>ARGM-TMP
if  
you  >ARG1
move  V01
overseas  <ARG2
you  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
come  V01
back  <ARG4
to  
New  
Zealand  
for  
a  
short  
amount  <ARGM-TMP
of  
time  
before  
they  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
force  V01
you  >ARG0
cough  V03
up  
.  

And  >>>ARGM-DIS
all  
that  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
're  V01
overseas  <ARG2
you  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
racking  V01
up  
interest  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
like  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
having  V03
the  
option  <ARG1
to  
return  V01
to  
NZ  <ARG4
.  

I  >ARG0
guess  V01
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
fortunate  V01
that  
I  >ARG0
received  V01
a  
scholarship  >ARG0
which  >R-ARG0
paid  V01
about  
800  <ARG1
f  
my  
course  
fees  
through  
my  
degree  <ARGM-TMP
.  

But  
I  >ARG0
worked  V01
hard  <ARGM-MNR
and  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
working  V01
hard  <ARGM-MNR
.  

There  
are  V02
far  
too  
many  
lazy  
people  >ARG0
out  
there  
who  >R-ARG0
think  V01
that  
they  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
sit  V01
around  <ARGM-ADV
a  
job  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
fall  V01
in  
their  
lap  <ARG4
.  

My  
2  
c.  
....  

Get  V01
an  
education  V01
!  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
doing  V02
fine  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Whilst  
youth  
jobs  >>ARG1
are  V01
thin  V03
on  
the  
ground  <ARGM-LOC
,  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
assume  V02
it  >>ARG1
's  V01
better  V02
in  
Oz  <ARGM-LOC
.  

People  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
fleeing  V05
this  
country  <ARG1
at  
roughly  
a  
plane  
load  <ARGM-ADV
per  
week  
for  
the  
past  
20  
+  
years  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
's  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
anything  <ARG2
new  
.  

It  >ARG0
depends  V01
on  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
hunger  V01
for  <C-ARG1
.  

700  
f  
jobs  >>ARG1
are  V03
n't  >ARGM-NEG
advertised  V01
.  

That  >ARG1
means  V01
making  V02
yourself  <ARG1
known  <ARG1
;  
that  >ARG1
means  V01
networking  V01
.  

why  >>ARGM-CAU
does  V01
my  
baby  
king  
snake  >>ARG0
refuse  V01
to  
eat  V01
?  

i  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
baby  
eastern  
king  
snake  <ARG1

i  >>ARG0
have  V01

EVERYTHING  <ARG1
i  
can  
to

him  >ARG0

he  >ARG0

he  >ARG0

a

with

lots

everything  >>ARG1

as  >ARGM-CXN
good  V02

it  >ARG1

his

according

stick  V01
his

he  >ARG0

down  <ARGM-DIR

him  <ARG1
every

he  >ARG1

feisty  <ARG2

as  
most

he  >ARG1

a

he  >>ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG

i  >ARG0

that  >R-ARG1
was  V01
bigger  
around  <ARG2
than  
he  >ARG1
is  V01
.  

i  >>ARG0
have  V01
tried  V01
putting  V01
him  <ARG1
in  
a  
small  
container  <ARG2
and  
putting  V01
him  <ARG1
in  
a  
dark  
place  <ARG2
for  
an  
hour  <ARGM-TMP
or  
so  
and  
he  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
touch  V01
the  
pinky  <ARG1
.  

he  >>>ARG0
crawls  V01
on  
top  <ARG1
of  
them  
but  
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
try  V01
to  
eat  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

he  >>>ARG0
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem  V01
to  
know  V01
that  
they  >ARG1
are  V01
food  <ARG2
.  

i  >>>ARG0
have  V01
tried  V01
"  
braining  V01
"  
both  
live  
and  
dead  
pinkies  <ARG1
,  
and  
bloodying  V01
them  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-PRD
to  
get  V01
his  >ARG0
attention  V02
,  
but  
he  >>ARG0
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
care  V01
.  

i  >>>ARG0
have  V01
tried  V01
dipping  V02
both  
live  
and  
thawed  V01
pinkies  <ARG1
in  
tuna  
juice  
,  
and  
in  
used  >ARGM-ADJ
gerbil  >ARG1
bedding  V02
.  

i  >>>ARG0
have  V01
bought  V01
some  
long  
reptile  
feeding  
tweezers  <ARG1
and  
have  V01
tried  V01
holding  V01
the  
pinky  <ARG1
in  
front  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
snake  
's  
face  
.  

he  >>ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
try  V01
to  
bite  V01
.  

i  >>ARG1
am  V01
very  
discouraged  <ARG2
and  
sad  V02
and  
i  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
what  >ARG1
to  
do  V02
.  

he  >>ARG0
has  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
eaten  V01
in  
an  
entire  
month  <ARGM-TMP
.  

i  >>>ARG0
've  V01
only  >ARGM-ADV
tried  V01
to  
feed  V01
him  <ARG2
one  <ARGM-MNR
at  
a  
time  
.  

he  >ARG1
's  V01
just  
a  
tiny  
baby  <ARG2
,  
about  
the  
width  
of  
a  
pencil  
.  

do  V01
babies  >ARG0
this  
small  
hibernate  V01
?  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
feed  V01
him  <ARG2
how  
many  
pinkies  >>ARG1
do  V01
you  >ARG0
feed  V01
him  <ARG2
?  

If  
you  >ARG0
feed  V01
him  <ARG2
too  
many  <ARG1
he  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
just  >>ARGM-ADV
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V01
hungry  V01
.  

If  
he  >>>ARG1
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem  V01
interested  V01
in  
them  <ARG2
at  
all  <ARGM-EXT
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
he  >>ARG0
's  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG
hungry  V01
.  

My  
boyfriend  >ARG0
has  V03
one  <ARG1
and  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
she  >>ARG0
's  V01
hungry  V01
she  >ARG0
attacks  V01
the  
pinkie  <ARG1
right  
away  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
smell  V01
it  <ARG1
so  >>ARGM-ADV
i  >>ARG0
'm  V01
sure  V02
he  >>>ARG0
knows  V01
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
is  V01
and  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

Remember  V01
snakes  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
go  V06
a  
while  <ARGM-TMP
without  
eating  V01
.  

In  
the  
winter  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
usually  >>ARGM-ADV
go  V02
deep  
underground  <ARG4
and  
enter  V01
a  
hibernation  
-  
like  
state  >ARG1
called  V01
brumation  V01
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V03
characterized  V01
by  
a  
slowed  >ARGM-ADJ
metabolism  V01
and  
reduced  
activity  
.  

King  
snakes  >>ARG0
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
stop  V01
eating  V01
,  
particularly  
during  
the  
cooler  
part  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
year  
.  

They  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
natural  
instinct  <ARG1
to  
hibernate  V01
.  

If  
the  
snake  >>ARG0
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
pregnant  >>>ARGM-ADV
or  
shedding  V01
,  
and  
its  
enclosure  >>ARG1
is  V03
properly  >ARGM-ADV
equipped  V01
,  
a  
loss  V02
of  
appetite  <ARG1
probably  >ARGM-ADV
signals  V07
a  
beginning  V01
of  
hibernation  V01
.  

Hibernation  V01
is  V01
natural  <ARG2
,  
and  
a  
necessity  
for  
snakes  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
are  V03
going  V04
to  
be  V03
bred  V01
.  

Another  
thing  >>>ARG1
that  >R-ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
cause  V01
a  
king  
snake  >>ARG0
to  
stop  V01
eating  V01
is  V01
shedding  V01
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
tell  V02
when  
your  
king  
snake  >>ARG0
is  V01
about  <ARG2
to  
shed  V01
,  
because  
its  
eyes  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
get  V03
milky  
looking  <ARG2
.  

Its  
body  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
dull  V04
looking  <ARGM-PRD
,  
too  <ARGM-DIS
.  

In  
a  
few  
days  >ARGM-TMP
the  
snake  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
begin  V02
to  
shed  V01
its  
skin  <ARG1
.  

For  
example  >ARGM-DIS
,  
some  
snakes  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
routinely  >ARGM-TMP
go  V06
off  
their  
food  <ARG2
in  
both  
the  
summer  <ARGM-TMP
and  
winter  
,  
feeding  V01
mainly  <ARGM-ADV
in  
spring  <ARGM-TMP
and  
fall  
.  

It  >>>ARG1
's  V01
natural  V03
and  
so  
long  >>>ARGM-TMP
as  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see  V01
any  
serious  >ARGM-EXT
deterioration  V01
in  
their  
health  <ARG1
is  V01
nothing  >ARG1
to  
worry  V02
about  <C-ARG1
.  

You  >ARG0
see  V01
,  
some  
snakes  >ARG0
for  
no  
obvious  
reason  >ARGM-PRP
will  >ARGM-MOD
simply  >ARGM-ADV
go  V06
off  
their  
food  <ARG2
.  

They  >>>ARG2
're  V01
fit  V05
and  
healthy  V01
and  
their  >ARG0
care  V03
is  V01
suitable  V04
.  

hope  V01
this  >ARG0
helped  V01
.  

That  >ARG1
's  V01
why  >>ARGM-CAU
it  >>>ARG0
's  V01
good  V02
to  
have  V03
a  
python  <ARG1
!  

It  >>ARG0
's  V01
twice  
my  
size  <ARG2
and  
eats  V01
a  
rabbit  <ARG1
once  
a  
month  
.  

are  V03
my  
two  
cats  >>ARG0
fighting  V01
or  
playing  V01
?  

how  
rough  >>ARG1
is  V01
too  >ARGM-EXT
rough  V04
?  

help  V01
!?  

i  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
1  
and  
a  
half  
year  
old  
male  
neutered  
cat  <ARG1
and  
a  
new  
2  
month  
old  
spayed  
female  
kitten  
.  

the  
first  
night  >>>ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
brought  V01
her  <ARG1
home  <ARG2
i  >>>ARG0
did  V02
the  
sniffing  V01
under  
the  
door  <ARGM-LOC
thing  <<ARG1
and  
left  V14
it  <ARG1
at  
that  <ARG1
.  

the  
next  
day  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
let  V01
her  <ARG1
out  
of  
the  
bedroom  <ARG1
so  
they  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
check  V05
each  
other  <ARG1
out  <C-V
,  
and  
the  
kitten  >ARG0
hissed  V01
twice  <ARGM-TMP
within  
the  
first  
20  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
of  
meeting  V02
each  
other  <ARG1
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG0
no  
longer  >ARGM-NEG
hisses  V01
and  
they  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
playing  V01
(  
chasing  V01
each  
other  <ARG1
up  
and  
down  
the  
hall  <ARGM-DIR
,  
rolling  V01
around  <ARGM-DIR
on  
the  
ground  <ARG2
and  
pawing  V01
at  
each  
other  <ARG1
)  
.  

only  
once  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG0
looked  V02
like  
my  
male  
cat  >>ARG0
was  V03
biting  V01
at  
her  
neck  <ARG1
and  
then  
her  
stomach  
and  
she  >>>ARG0
was  V03
meowing  V01
fairly  
loud  <ARGM-MNR
and  
hissed  V01
once  <ARGM-TMP
then  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
backed  V11
off  
and  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
fine  V04
.  

were  
they  >ARG0
roughhouse  >ARGM-MNR
playing  V01
?  

or  >ARGM-DIS
were  
they  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
fighting  V01
?  

he  >>>ARG0
has  V01
been  V03
"  
biting  V01
"  
at  
her  
neck  <ARG1
and  
stomach  
previously  <ARGM-TMP
while  
they  >ARG0
play  V01
without  
her  >ARG0
meowing  V01
or  
anything  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
i  >>ARG0
m  V03
wondering  V01
if  
he  >ARG0
went  V02
a  
little  
to  
far  <ARGM-EXT
that  
one  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

any  
answers  V01
help  V01
!!!!!!  

you  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
leave  V12
the  
new  
kitten  <ARG1
in  
the  
room  <ARG2
long  
enough  <ARGM-TMP
.  

you  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
do  V02
that  <ARG1
for  
a  
least  
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
,  
or  
else  
this  
type  >>ARG1
of  
territorial  >ARG2
fighting  V01
will  >ARGM-MOD
happen  V01
.  

giving  V01
the  
new  
kitten  <ARG2
her  
own  
small  
territory  <ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
help  V01
her  >>ARG1
to  
feel  V01
safe  V01
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
her  >ARG0
a  
place  >ARG4
to  
go  V02
to  <C-ARG4
when  >ARGM-TMP
scared  V01
.  

right  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
your  
male  >>ARG0
is  V03
fighting  V02
off  
an  
intruder  <ARG1
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
feels  V02
that  
all  >ARG1
of  
the  
house  
is  V01
his  <ARG2
.  

put  V01
her  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
in  
the  
room  <ARG2
,  
and  
keep  V02
the  
door  >ARG1
closed  V01
for  
a  
week  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

then  >ARGM-ADV
let  V01
her  <ARG1
out  <ARG1
for  
ten  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
.  

make  V02
it  <ARG1
fifteen  <ARG1
the  
next  
day  <ARGM-TMP
,  
then  
twenty  <C-ARG1
,  
and  
so  
on  <C-ARG1
.  

this  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
two  
things  <ARG1
;  
the  
new  
kitten  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
rub  V01
her  
cheek  <ARG1
on  
the  
furniture  <ARG2
in  
her  
room  
,  
making  V02
it  <ARG1
her  
territory  <ARG1
.  

she  >>>ARG1
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
start  V01
to  
calm  V02
down  
and  
feel  V01
safe  V01
-  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
bet  V01
she  
does  V01
n't  
now  <<ARG2
.  

she  >>>ARG0
knows  V01
she  >>ARG0
is  V03
invading  V01
someone  
else  
's  
territory  <ARG1
,  
but  
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
help  V02
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
has  V03
no  
where  >ARG4
to  
go  V02
.  

she  >>>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
sleep  V01
without  
being  V01
afraid  V01
.  

as  >>ARGM-DIS
well  
,  
your  
male  >>>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
see  V01
that  
his  
territory  >>ARG2
is  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
threatened  V01
.  

when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
door  >ARG1
opens  V01
,  
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
that  
the  
one  
room  >ARG1
is  V01
hers  <ARG2
,  
and  
he  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
OK  <ARG2
with  
that  
.  

the  
territory  
thing  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
solved  V01
.  

your  
male  >>ARG0
is  V03
hurting  V01
her  <ARG1
to  
put  V01
her  <ARG1
in  
her  
place  <ARG2
-  
biting  V01
her  
scruff  <ARG1
is  V01
dominance  V01
and  
biting  V01
the  
belly  <ARG1
is  V01
a  
move  V01
cats  >ARG0
use  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
hunting  V01
-  
to  
pull  V01
the  
guts  <ARG1
out  
of  
their  
prey  <ARG2
.  

this  >>ARG1
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
good  V02
.  

give  V01
them  <ARG2
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
set  V03
up  
their  
territories  <ARG1
,  
and  
once  
you  >ARG0
bring  V01
the  
new  
kitten  <ARG1
out  <ARG3
,  
pay  V01
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
attention  V02
to  
the  
male  <<ARG2
.  

you  >>ARG0
have  V01
brought  V01
someone  <ARG1
else  
into  
his  
territory  <ARG2
,  
and  
he  >>>ARG2
needs  V01
to  
be  V03
reminded  V01
that  
you  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
love  V01
him  <ARG1
,  
and  
support  V01
his  >ARG0
claim  V02
to  
his  
space  <ARG1
.  

that  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
help  V01
to  
reassure  V01
him  <ARG1
,  
and  
he  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
less  >ARGM-CXN
aggressive  V01
with  
her  <ARG1
.  

when  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
play  
fight  V01
,  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hiss  V01
.  

if  
they  >ARG0
hiss  V01
,  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
playing  V01
.  

if  
they  >ARG0
bite  V01
,  
and  
one  >ARG0
cries  V02
,  
you  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
separate  V01
them  <ARG1
,  
and  
you  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
keep  V02
an  
eye  <ARG2
on  
them  
.  

hissing  V01
is  V01
OK  <ARG2
,  
unless  
they  >>ARG0
start  V01
to  
fight  V01
.  

if  
that  >ARG1
happens  V01
,  
separate  V01
them  <ARG1
,  
and  
give  V01
them  <ARG2
time  <ARG1
apart  
.  

putting  V01
the  
girl  <ARG1
in  
her  
territory  <ARG2
will  >ARGM-MOD
make  V02
her  >>ARG0
feel  V01
less  >ARGM-EXT
afraid  V01
,  
and  
she  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
relax  V01
.  

good  
luck  
!  

A  
hiss  >ARG1
is  V01
basically  <ARGM-ADV
a  
"  
get  V05
the  
f*ck  
away  <ARG2
"  
sound  V02
.  

It  >ARG1
means  V01
they  >>ARG0
've  V01
gone  V02
too  
far  <ARGM-EXT
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG1
start  V01
bleeding  V01
that  >ARG1
means  V01
they  >>ARG0
're  V03
really  >ARGM-ADV
fighting  V01
.  

If  
they  >>>ARG0
're  V03
going  V02
kinda  
slow  <ARGM-MNR
and  
like  >>ARGM-DIS
fake  >ARGM-MNR
biting  V01
(  
not  >ARGM-NEG
biting  V01
as  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
as  
they  
can  
)  
,  
and  
fake  >ARGM-ADJ
scratching  V02
(  
not  >ARGM-NEG
hitting  V01
as  
hard  <ARGM-MNR
as  
they  
can  
with  
their  
paws  <ARGM-MNR
)  
then  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
're  V03
playing  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
two  
cats  <ARG1
,  
and  
at  
first  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
hissed  V01
at  
each  
other  <ARGM-GOL
because  
cats  >ARG1
are  V01
very  
territorial  <ARG2
,  
but  
now  >>>ARGM-TMP
they  >>>ARG0
do  V01
fight  V01
and  
play  V01
.  

The  
difference  V02
is  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
cat  >ARG0
hisses  V01
,  
that  >ARG1
means  V01
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
annoyed  V01
and  
they  >ARG0
want  V01
the  
other  
cat  >ARG0
to  
go  V02
away  <ARGM-DIR
.  

That  >ARG1
means  V01
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
fighting  V01
.  

When  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
just  >ARGM-ADV
jumping  V03
at  
each  
other  <ARGM-DIR
and  
their  
tails  >>ARG1
are  V03
wagging  V01
that  >ARG1
means  V01
that  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
playing  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
how  >>ARGM-MNR
you  >>ARG1
get  V03
confused  V01
though  <ARGM-DIS
.  
:)  

What  
was  
the  
goal  
for  
North  
Vietnam  
in  
the  
Tet  
offensive  
?  

When  >ARGM-TMP
Johnson  >ARG0
deployed  V01
troops  <ARG1
in  
1964  <ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG1
was  V03
advised  V01
by  
the  
military  <ARG0
it  
would  >ARGM-MOD
take  V10
a  
half  
-  
million  
troops  <ARG2
about  
ten  
years  <ARG1
to  
pacify  V01
South  
Vietnam  <ARG1
.  

He  >>>ARG0
refused  V01
to  
believe  V01
them  <ARG1
and  
ordered  V01
the  
military  >ARG0
to  
win  V01
the  
war  V01
within  
two  
to  
three  
years  <<ARGM-TMP
(  
before  
the  
next  >ARGM-TMP
election  V01
in  
1968  <ARGM-TMP
)  
.  

He  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
give  V01
them  <ARG2
the  
number  >ARG1
of  
troops  
they  >ARG0
requested  V01
.  

This  >ARG0
left  V13
Westmoreland  <ARG1
with  
few  
options  <ARG1
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
he  >ARG0
adapted  V01
a  
Search  V01
and  
Destroy  V01
strategy  <<<ARG1
instead  
of  
a  
Clear  V01
and  
Defend  V01
strategy  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
,  
in  
the  
long  >ARGM-ADJ
run  V13
,  
the  
preferred  
method  <<ARG2
of  
pacifying  V01
an  
insurgency  <ARG1
.  

Thing  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
it  >ARG1
worked  V09
.  

The  
ARVN  >>ARG0
was  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
having  V03
a  
big  
problem  <ARG1
with  
the  
Local  
VC  
(  
the  
guerilla  >ARG0
movement  V07
)  
,  
they  >>>ARG1
were  V03
being  V03
challenged  V01
by  
the  
Main  
Force  
VC  >ARG1
(  
which  >R-ARG1
was  V01
light  
infantry  <ARG2
)  
and  
the  
North  
Vietnamese  
Army  
(  
NVA  
)  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
the  
Americans  >ARG1
swept  V02
in  <ARG3
with  
their  >>>ARG0
Search  V01
and  
Destroy  V01
operations  V01
the  
Communists  >ARG0
quickly  >ARGM-TMP
leaned  V01
they  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
stand  V07
up  
to  
the  
US  
firepower  <ARG2
,  
and  
these  
regular  
troops  >>>ARG0
were  V03
forced  V01
to  
flee  V05
the  
country  <ARG1
and  
take  V01
sanctuary  <ARG1
across  
the  
borders  <ARG3
in  
Laos  <ARGM-LOC
and  
Cambodia  
.  

All  
those  
sunny  >ARGM-ADJ
reports  V01
about  
the  
progress  V01
in  
Vietnam  <ARGM-LOC
were  V01
correct  V02
,  
the  
Communists  >>>ARG1
WERE  V03
being  V03
defeated  V01
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
Johnson  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
let  V01
the  
military  >>ARG0
cross  V02
the  
borders  <ARG1
and  
clean  V03
out  
the  
Communist  
bases  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG2
was  V03
warned  V01
that  
they  >>>ARG0
were  V03
building  V05
up  
a  
huge  
Army  <ARG1
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
eventually  >ARGM-TMP
launch  V01
an  
attack  V01
,  
but  
he  >ARG0
ignored  V01
his  
military  
advisers  <ARG1
.  

The  
Communists  >ARG0
agreed  V01
.  

They  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
defeat  V01
the  
Americans  <ARG1
.  

However  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
what  >>>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
hoped  V01
to  
do  V02
during  
the  
Tet  
Offensive  <ARGM-TMP
was  V01
to  
sneak  V01
past  
the  
Americans  <ARGM-DIR
and  
attack  V01
the  
ARVN  <ARG1
in  
the  
urban  
areas  >>ARG2
where  >>R-ARG2
they  >>>ARG0
were  V03
deployed  V01
doing  VLV
successful  >>>ARGM-ADJ
Clear  V01
and  
Defend  V01
operations  V01
.  

The  
Communists  >ARG0
thought  V01
they  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
defeat  V01
the  
ARVN  <ARG1
,  
cause  V01
the  
fall  V05
of  
the  
South  
Vietnamese  
government  <ARG1
,  
and  
the  
people  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
than  >>ARGM-TMP
rally  V01
to  
the  
Communist  
cause  <ARG2
and  
leave  V12
the  
Americans  <ARG1
stranded  <ARG2
in  
a  
sea  
of  
angry  
peasants  
.  

THAT  >ARG1
WAS  V01
THE  
PLAN  V01
.  

What  >ARG1
happened  V01
?  

The  
Americans  >>>ARG0
detected  V01
the  
attempt  V01
to  
infiltrate  V01
the  
urban  
areas  <ARG1
and  
were  V03
already  >ARGM-TMP
redeploying  V01
troops  <ARG1
from  
the  
rural  
areas  
.  

The  
ARVN  >>>ARG0
rushed  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
from  
holiday  >ARG1
leave  V09
and  
counterattacked  V01
.  

Within  
24  
hours  >>>ARGM-TMP
every  
Communist  >ARG0
assault  V01
had  V01
been  V03
defeated  V01
except  
in  
the  
ancient  
capital  <ARGM-ADV
of  
Hue  
.  

The  
government  >>ARG1
did  V01
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
fall  V05
.  

And  
the  
South  
Vietnamese  
people  
?  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
give  V01
the  
ultimate  >ARGM-ADJ
choice  V01
,  
they  >ARG1
rallied  V01
…  

TO  
THE  
SOUTH  
VIETNAMESE  
GOVERNMENT  
….  

Tet  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
huge  
military  
and  
political  
disaster  <ARG2
for  
the  
Communists  
.  

They  >>ARG1
were  V03
chased  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
into  
Laos  
and  
Cambodia  
with  
the  
ARVN  <ARGM-ADV
in  
hot  >ARGM-ADJ
pursuit  V01
.  

The  
people  >ARG0
rejected  V01
their  >ARG0
attempt  V01
to  
topple  V01
the  
government  <ARG1
,  
and  
for  
all  
intents  >ARGM-ADV
and  
purposes  
the  
US  
military  >ARG0
(  
and  
the  
ARVN  
)  
handed  V01
Johnson  <ARG2
the  
victory  V01
he  >>ARG0
had  V01
ordered  V01
them  >ARG0
to  
achieve  V01
within  
the  
time  
-  
frame  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
ordered  V01
it  <ARG2
.  

All  >>>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
do  V02
for  
a  
complete  >ARGM-EXT
victory  V01
was  V01
allow  V01
the  
military  >>ARG0
to  
go  V02
into  
Laos  <ARG4
and  
Cambodia  
and  
finish  V05
off  
the  
shattered  
Communist  
forces  <ARG1
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
Johnson  >ARG1
was  V01
so  
obtuse  <ARG2
he  >>ARG0
did  V01
n’t  >ARGM-NEG
understand  V01
he  >>ARG0
had  VLV
a  
victory  V01
when  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
was  V03
handed  V01
to  
him  <ARG2
on  
a  
silver  
platter  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Instead  >>>ARGM-DIS
he  >>>ARG0
pulled  V01
the  
military  <ARG1
off  <ARG2
,  
stopped  V01
the  
bombing  V01
of  
North  
Vietnam  <ARG1
,  
withdrew  V01
from  
the  
presidential  >ARG2
race  V02
,  
and  
spent  V02
the  
rest  <ARG1
of  
his  
term  
in  
office  
trying  V01
to  
surrender  V01
to  
North  
Vietnam  <ARG2
.  

They  >>ARG0
screwed  V01
up  
by  
not  >ARGM-NEG
accepting  V01
his  >ARG0
surrender  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
offered  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

The  
American  
people  >>>ARG0
were  V03
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
having  V03
any  <ARG1
of  
it  
,  
and  
elected  V01
Richard  >>>ARG0
Nixon  
to  
fix  V02
the  
mess  >>ARG1
LBJ  >>ARG0
had  V01
made  V01
(  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
surrender  V01
like  
the  
antiwar  >ARG1
movement  V07
was  V03
demanding  V01
)  
.  

In  
the  
end  V01
Nixon  >ARG0
kept  V01
his  >ARG0
promise  V01
for  
“  
…  
peace  V01
with  
honor  V01
….  
”  

But  >ARGM-DIS
that  >ARG1
’s  V01
another  
question  <ARG2
.  

To  
emancipate  V01
the  
south  <ARG1
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
serious  
failure  <ARG2
.  

To  
make  V02
the  
war  V01
unpalatable  <<ARG1
to  
the  
American  
public  
.  

In  
that  >ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >ARG0
pretty  
much  >ARGM-EXT
succeeded  V01
.  

Before  
Tet  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
war  V01
was  V01
unpopular  <ARG2
but  
tolerable  V02
to  
the  
majority  <ARG0
of  
Americans  
in  
that  
the  
loss  V02
of  
American  
lives  <ARG1
was  V03
seen  V01
as  
the  
cost  <ARG2
of  
subduing  V01
the  
VC  <ARG1
and  
NVA  
.  

Tet  >ARG0
made  V02
it  <ARG1
clear  V06
that  
the  
war  V01
was  V01
a  
long  >ARGM-DIR
way  V01
from  
being  V01
over  <ARG2
if  
the  
Americans  >ARG0
thought  V01
they  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
preserve  V01
the  
South  <ARG1
and  
that  
the  
North  >>>ARG0
was  V01
perfectly  >ARGM-ADV
willing  V02
to  
suffer  V01
great  >ARGM-EXT
losses  V03
to  
continue  V01
their  >ARG0
fight  V01
.  

There  
is  V02
a  
very  
good  
book  >>ARG1
on  
the  
subject  
that  >>R-ARG1
was  V03
written  V01
by  
General  
Vo  <ARG0
Nguyen  
Giap  
.  

Try  V01
google  <ARG1
to  
find  V01
the  
title  <ARG1
if  
you  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
read  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

Bearded  
dragon  
question  
...  
?  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
bought  V01
a  
baby  <ARG1
one  
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
basking  
spot  
lamp  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
says  V01
it  >>>ARG0
is  V01
a  
double  
reflector  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
focuses  V01
35  
%  
more  
light  <ARG1
/  
heat  
and  
provides  V01
beneficial  
UVA  
rays  <ARG1
important  
to  
the  
psycholical  >ARGM-MNR
well  >ARGM-MNR
-  
being  V02
of  
him  <ARG1
.  

My  
question  >ARG1
is  V01
does  V01
that  >ARG1
mean  V01
it  >ARG0
gives  V01
him  <ARG2
not  
only  
the  
heat  <ARG1
,  
but  
the  
"  
sun  
rays  >ARG1
"  
he  >ARG0
needs  V01
?  

I  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-DIS
was  V03
wondering  V01
how  
long  >ARGM-EXT
should  >ARGM-MOD
this  
light  >ARG1
be  V01
on  <ARG2
.  

The  
lady  >ARG0
at  
pet  
smart  
said  V01
4  
hours  <ARG1
,  
but  
on  
places  >ARGM-LOC
on  
the  
net  
it  >ARG0
says  V01
10  
to  
12  
hours  <ARG1
.  

He  >>>ARG0
's  V03
getting  V03
used  V02
to  
his  
new  
home  <ARG1
,  
but  
has  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
eatin  V01
yet  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
bearded  
dragon  
juvenile  
food  <ARG1
and  
freeze  
-  
dried  
crickets  
.  

Any  
advice  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
greatly  >ARGM-ADV
appreciated  V02
.  

Thank  V01
you  <ARG1
for  
your  
time  <ARG2
.  

Let  V01
me  >>ARG0
try  V01
to  
break  V12
this  <ARG1
down  <C-V
as  
simply  <ARGM-MNR
as  
I  
can  
:  
diurnal  
(  
active  
during  
the  
day  
time  
)  
reptiles  >ARG0
like  
the  
bearded  
dragon  
require  V01
3  
types  <ARG1
of  
"  
light  
,  
"  
UVA  
,  
UVB  
,  
and  
heat  
.  

Any  
white  
light  
emitting  
light  
source  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
emit  V01
UVA  <ARG1
,  
including  
heat  
bulbs  <C-ARG0
,  
that  >ARG1
's  V01
the  
easy  
one  >ARG2
to  
provide  V01
for  <C-ARG2
.  

UVB  >>ARG1
on  
the  
other  
hand  >>ARGM-ADV
can  >>ARGM-MOD
only  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V03
reproduced  V01
by  
a  
fluorescent  
source  <ARG0
.  

UVB  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
always  >ARGM-TMP
be  V01
a  
separate  
bulb  <ARG2
from  
the  
heat  
lamp  
,  
unless  
you  >ARG0
use  V01
a  
MVB  >ARG1
(  
mercury  
vapor  
bulb  
)  
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
the  
only  
reptile  >ARG0
use  V01
bulb  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
emit  V01
both  
UVB  <ARG1
and  
heat  
from  
one  
bulb  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
that  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
use  V01
coiled  
/  
compact  
UVB  
bulbs  <ARG1
as  
they  >>>ARG0
are  V03
known  V01
to  
cause  V01
severe  >ARGM-EXT
eye  >ARG1
damage  V01
and  
/  
or  
blindness  
in  
reptiles  <<ARGM-LOC
not  
to  
mention  
they  >ARG0
have  V03
trouble  <ARG1
maintaining  V01
UVB  >ARG1
output  V10
over  
time  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
long  
tube  
UVB  
bulbs  >>ARG1
are  V01
best  V02
,  
like  
Zoomed  
's  
Repsitun  
model  <ARGM-PRD
:  
http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/  
Remember  V01
to  
replace  V01
UVB  
bulbs  <ARG1
according  
to  
the  
manufacturer  >ARG0
s  >ARG0
recommendation  V01
after  
which  
time  >R-ARGM-TMP
the  
bulb  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
no  
longer  >ARGM-TMP
produce  V01
UVB  <ARG1
even  
if  
visible  
light  
still  
is  V03
.  

So  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
to  
answer  V01
your  
question  <ARG1
,  
no  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
have  V03
a  
bulb  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
says  V01
it  >ARG0
produces  V01
UVA  <ARG1
then  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
"  
the  
sun  
's  
rays  >ARG1
"  
that  >R-ARG1
your  
bearded  >ARG0
needs  V01
.  

You  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
also  >ARGM-ADV
provide  V01
a  
source  <ARG1
a  
UVB  
lighting  
.  

The  
person  >>ARG1
at  
Petsmart  
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
wrong  V04
;  
in  
fact  >ARGM-ADV
it  
is  V01
always  <ARGM-TMP
a  
good  
idea  <ARG2
to  
second  >ARGM-ADV
guess  V01
what  >ARG1
most  
pet

employees  >ARG0
tell  V01
you  <ARG2
;  
they  >>>ARG0

n't  >ARGM-NEG

the

Freeze  
dried  
food  >ARG1

not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
good  
staple

you  >ARG0

live  
feeder

Bearded  
dragons  >ARG1

sight

a

mm  >ARGM-DIS
it  >ARG0
depends  V01
on  
the  
size  <ARG1
of  
his  
tank  
or  
cage  
or  
whatever  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
him  <ARG1
in  
..  
atleast  
as  
far  <<ARGM-ADV
as  
i  >>ARG1
'm  V01
concerned  V01
.  

if  
there  
are  V02
shady  
areas  <ARG1
he  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
move  V01
to  <ARG2
(  
for  
example  
a  
3  
x  
5  
x  
4  
tank  
with  
light  
on  
one  
side  
)  
then  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
leave  V14
it  <ARG1
on  <ARG1
a  
full  
12  
-  
14  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
,  
if  
it  >ARG1
s  V01
a  
small  
tank  <ARG2
and  
he  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
escape  V01
the  
light  <ARG1
then  
4  
-  
6  
at  
most  
at  
a  
time  
though  
quite  
possibly  
4  
-  
6  
hours  
at  
a  
time  
twice  
a  
day  
.  

either  
way  V01
you  >>ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
need  V01
to  
keep  V02
an  
eye  <ARG1
on  
the  
temperature  <ARG2
if  
you  >>ARG0
are  V03
using  V01
a  
dry  
fish  
tank  <ARG1
as  <ARG2
UV  
lights  <ARG2
in  
my  >ARG0
experience  V01
up  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
temperature  
significantly  
and  
without  
proper  >ARGM-MNR
ventilation  V01
it  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
become  V01
an  
oven  <ARG2
.  

as  
to  
what  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
light  >ARG0
provides  V01
it  >ARG0
gives  V01
UV  
rays  >>ARG1
..  <ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
important  V01
for  
health  <ARG2
in  
lizards  <ARGM-LOC
as  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
humans  <ARGM-LOC
.  

That  
lady  >ARG1
at  
PetSmart  
is  V01
a  
disgrace  <ARG2
to  
the  
rest  
of  
us  
PetSmart  
associates  
...  
sheesh  <ARGM-DIS
.  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
it  >ARG0
gives  V01
him  <ARG2
the  
"  
sun  
rays  <ARG1
"  
necessary  
,  
that  >ARG1
's  V01
what  >ARG2
UVA  >ARG1
is  V01
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
it  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
on  <ARG2
10  
-  
12  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
,  
just  
like  
the  
sun  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
up  <ARG2
for  
10  
-  
12  
hours  <ARGM-EXT
in  
his  
natural  
environment  <ARGM-LOC
.  

As  
for  
the  
heat  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V01
sure  V01
to  
use  V01
a  
thermometer  <ARG1
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
Beardies  >>ARG0
often  >>ARGM-TMP
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
eat  V01
food  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
moving  V01
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
it  
s  V01
anyone  >ARG0
's  
guess  V01
whether  
or  
not  
he  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
touch  V01
the  
freeze  
-  
dried  
crickets  <ARG1
or  
the  
processed  
food  
.  

I  >ARG0
tell  V01
all  
my  
customers  <ARG2
they  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
try  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
but  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
count  V03
on  
it  <ARG1
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
try  V01
green  
leafy  
veggies  <ARG1
,  
like  
kale  
and  
spinach  
.  

Best  
of  
luck  
!  

Is  V01
a  
finch  >ARG1
or  
a  
parakeet  
better  V02
?

more  >ARGM-EXT
fun  V01
to  
have  V03
as  
pets  <ARGM-PRD
AND  
I  >>ARG0
NEED  V01
TO  
KNOW  V01
WHICH  >>ARG1
WOULD  >>ARGM-MOD
BE  V01
QUIETEST  V04
i  >>ARG0
honestly  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
care  V01
but

family

!  

Please  >ARGM-DIS

and  
please  >ARGM-DIS

one  >>ARG1

thx  
!!!!!!  

Hi  
there  
,  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
choose  V01
the  
parakeet  <ARG1
...  

Here  >ARG2
s  V01
my  
reason  <ARG1
.....  

I  >ARG0
did  V02
the  
same  
thing  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
you  >ARG0
did  V02
for  
christmas  <<ARGM-PRP
.  

I  >>ARG0
ended  V03
up  
getting  V01
a  
pair  <ARG1
of  
zebra  
finches  
for  
christmas  <ARGM-TMP
.  

At  
first  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
all  >ARGM-ADV
cool  V04
and  
all  
.  

They  >>>ARG0
were  V03
chirping  V01
and  
doing  V02
their  
every  
day  
business  <ARG1
.  

After  
a  
couple  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
weeks  
I  >>ARG0
got  V03
tired  V03
of  
them  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG1
are  V01
quite  
messy  <ARG2
and  
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
hold  V01
or  
pet  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
ve  V01
tried  V01
to  
tame  V01
them  <ARG1
and  
they  >>ARG1
just  >>ARGM-ADV
would  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
get  V03
tamed  V01
.  

They  >>>ARG1
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
be  V03
held  V01
or  
touched  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
want  V01
a  
bird  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
hold  V01
and  
do  V02
tricks  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
have  V03
them  <ARG1
and  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
doing  V02
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

A  
couple  
of  
months  
after  
I  >ARG0
got  V01
parakeets  
/  
budgies  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG1
are  V01
adorable  V02
they  >ARG0
have  V03
beautiful  
colors  <ARG1
and  
personality  
.  

I  >ARG0
love  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

First  >ARGM-TMP
of  
all  
they  >ARG1
are  V01
very  
tame  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
tamed  V01
them  <ARG1
in  
4  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
tricks  V01
and  
they  >ARG1
are  V01
nt  <ARGM-NEG
messy  <ARG2
.  

The  
whole  
family  >ARG0
loves  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

My  
parents  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
plays  V01
with  
them  <ARG3
.  

They  >ARG1
are  V01
a  
big  
part  <ARG2
of  
our  
family  
.  

I  >ARG0
hope  V01
this  >ARG0
helps  V01
you  <ARG2
with  
your  >ARG0
decision  V01
.  

They  >ARG1
are  V01
both  <ARGM-ADV
about  
the  
same  
noise  
level  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
choosing  V01
a  
parakeet  <ARG1
look  V01
for  
a  
young  
one  <ARG1
.  

(  
the  
younger  
the  
eaiser  
to  
tame  V01
)  
Look  V01
for  
clean  
smooth  
feathers  
,  
beak  <ARG1
,  
and  
clean  
vent  
feathers  
(  
the  
feathers  
around  
the  
butt  
..  
dirty  
vent  
feathers  >ARG1
means  V01
the  
bird  >>ARG2
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
healthy  V01
)  
Look  V01
for  
a  
dark  
eye  <ARG1
with  
no  
circles  
(  
the  
older  
ones  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
circle  
ring  <ARG1
in  
their  
eyes  
)  
.  

Look  V01
for  
a  
lot  >>ARG0
of  
stripes  
in  
their  
head  
that  >>R-ARG0
starts  V01
from  
the  
beak  <ARGM-DIR
and  
goes  V02
back  <ARG4
to  
the  
back  
fo  
the  
bird  
.  

the  
stripes  >ARG1
are  V01
like  
hair  <ARG2
the  
less  
stipes  
the  
older  
.  

(  
think  V01
of  
a  
balding  
man  <ARG1
lol  <ARGM-DIS
)  
Look  V01
for  
clean  
feathers  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
want  V01
a  
boy  <ARG1
the  
cere  >>ARG1
(  
the  
nostrils  
piece  
above  
the  
beak  
)  
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
blue  V01
.  

The  
girl  >ARG0
has  V03
either  
pink  <ARG1
or  
brown  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend  V01
that  
you  >ARG0
get  V01
two  
parakeets  <ARG1
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
get  V01
either  
one  
male  <ARG1
and  
one  
female  
,  
or  
two  
males  
.  

Do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
two  
females  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG1
sometimes  >>ARGM-TMP
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
get  V18
along  
(  
you  >ARG0
know  V01
how  >ARG2
some  
girls  >ARG1
are  V01
lol  
hahahaahh  
but  
for  
real  >ARGM-ADV
though  >ARGM-ADV
,  
two  
girls  >>ARG0
tend  V02
to  
fight  V01
a  
lot  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
one  
yellow  
girl  <ARG1
and  
a  
green  
and  
yellow  
boy  
.  

They  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
best  <ARG2
!  

If  
you  >>ARG0
choose  V01
to  
get  V01
a  
parakeet  <ARG1
this  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
trick  V01
that  >R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
used  V01
to  
tame  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

However  >>>ARGM-DIS
if  
you  >ARG0
plan  V01
on  
getting  V01
one  <ARG1
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
get  V01
more  
than  
one  <ARG1
at  
the  
same  
time  <ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
need  V01
company  <ARG1
.  

My  
mom  >ARG0
told  V01
me  >ARG0
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
tame  V01
them  <ARG1
and  
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
happy  V01
with  
the  
results  <ARG0
.  

It  
took  V10
me  <ARG2
4  
days  <ARG1
to  
get  V04
the  
new  
one  >>>ARG0
to  
be  V01
able  V01
to  
step  V01
on  <ARG2
and  
eat  V01
out  
of  
my  
hand  <ARGM-DIR
.  

These  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
steps  V01
I  >ARG0
used  V01
.  

Honestly  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
have  V01
worked  V01
for  
me  <ARG2
twice  <ARGM-TMP
with  
my  
parakeets  <ARG1
.  

Hopefully  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
work  V01
for  
you  <ARG2
.  

1  
)  
When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
get  V01
the  
bird  <ARG1
,  
place  V01
him  <ARG1
or  
her  
or  
them  
in  
the  
cage  <ARG2
.  

Leave  V12
them  <ARG1
in  
there  <ARG2
with  
food  <ARGM-ADV
and  
water  
and  
such  
for  
about  
2  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
.  

2  
)  
Then  >ARGM-TMP
place  V01
you  
hand  <ARG1
in  
the  
cage  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
took  V01
the  
cage  <ARG1
and  
place  V01
it  <ARG1
next  <ARG2
to  
the  
couch  
.  

Then  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>>ARG0
sat  V01
on  
the  
couch  <ARG2
,  
placed  V01
one  
hand  <ARG1
in  
the  
cage  <ARG2
,  
holding  V01
a  
millet  
spray  <ARG1
.  

(  
this  
way  V01
the  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
associate  V01
your  
hand  <ARG1
with  
food  <ARG2
,  
and  
birds  >ARG0
love  V01
food  <ARG1
lol  
)  
Then  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
turned  V13
on  
the  
tv  <ARG1
and  
watch  V01
.  

This  
way  V01
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
that  
your  
hand  >>ARG1
is  V01
good  V02
and  
it  >>>ARG0
s  V03
not  
going  V04
to  
grab  V01
them  <ARG1
or  
hurt  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

Do  V02
this  <ARG1
for  
about  
one  
hour  <ARGM-TMP
.  

(  
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
take  VLV
breaks  V19
if  
you  
have  V02
too  
)  
and  
repeat  V01
the  
steps  V01
after  
about  
2  
hours  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

3  
)  
After  
about  
day  >ARGM-TMP
2  
,  
they  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
start  V01
to  
eating  V01
the  
millet  
spray  <ARG1
from  
your  
hand  <ARGM-DIR
.  

(  
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
take  V05
away  
the  
food  
dish  <ARG1
from  
the  
birds  <ARGM-DIR
,  
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
associate  V01
you  <ARG1
as  
the  
person  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
takes  V05
away  
their  
food  <ARG1
)  
....  

Then  >>>ARGM-TMP
take  V01
your  
finger  <ARG1
and  
place  V01
it  <ARG1
under  
their  
belly  <ARG2
,  
in  
front  <ARGM-LOC
of  
their

They  >>>ARG0

have  VLV
no  >ARGM-NEG
choice  V01

to  
go  V02
on  
your

When  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
see  V01
that  
you  >>ARG0
ar  V03
nt  >ARGM-NEG

the  >ARG0

when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0

)  
If  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
going  V02
up  <ARGM-DIR
by  
now  <ARGM-TMP
you  >>>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
got  V06
ta  
keep  V02

Do  V01
not  >>>ARGM-NEG
hit  V01

harm  V01
them  <ARG1

You  >ARG0
have  V03
patience  <ARG1
.  

Do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
give  V08
up  
!  

After  
a  
couple  >ARGM-TMP
of  
weeks  
mines  >ARG0
knows  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
say  V01
shoulder  <ARG1
it  >ARG1
means  V01
ot  
go  V02
on  
my  
sholder  <ARG4
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
say  V01
up  <ARG1
it  >ARG1

to  
jump  V05
up  
on  
my  
finger  <ARGM-LOC
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
say  V01
up  <ARG1

out  
it  >ARG1

up  
on  
my

out  
of  
the  
cage  
.  

and  >>>ARGM-DIS
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
say  V01
go  V02
home  <ARG4
it  >ARG1

to

the

Good  
luck  
!  

They  >ARG0
worked  V01
for  
me  <ARG2
and  
I  >ARG0
hope  V01
they  >ARG0
worked  V01
for  
you  <ARG2
!  

They  >>ARG0
are  V01
awesome  V01
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

And  >ARGM-DIS
that  >ARG1
s  V01
my  
reason  >ARGM-CAU
why  >R-ARGM-CAU
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
choose  V01
a  
parakeet  <ARG1
over  
a  
finch  <ARGM-ADV
.  

a  
parakeet  >>ARG1
is  V01
friendlier  V01

Parakeet  
.  

They  >>ARG1
are  V01
normally  >ARGM-MNR
quiet  V04
and  
it  
is  V01
easy  V05
to  
take  VLV
care  V03
of  
them  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG1
are  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
friendly  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
parakeet  >ARG1
named  V01
Cookie  <ARG2
.  
:P  

When  >ARG2
is  V01
the  
best  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
travel  V01
to  
Ireland  <ARG1
?  

My  
sister  >>ARG0
and  
I  
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
go  V02
to  
Ireland  <ARG4
.  

I  >ARG1
graduate  V01
in  
the  
spring  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
go  V02
between  
then  <ARGM-TMP
and  
winter  
.  

We  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
too  
many  
tourists  <ARG1
,  
and  
since  
we  >ARG1
'll  >ARGM-MOD
both  >ARGM-ADV
be  V01
out  
of  
school  >ARGM-CAU
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
go  V02
anytime  <ARGM-TMP
between  
the  
middle  
of  
June  
to  
early  
November  
.  

We  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
it  >>ARG1
to  
be  V01
too  >ARGM-EXT
cold  V01
(  
not  
sure  
when  >ARG2
exactly  
there  
fall  >ARG1
is  V01
...  
or  
what  >ARG2
the  
weather  >ARG1
is  V01
really  <ARGM-ADV
like  <C-ARG2
there  <ARGM-LOC
during  
our  
autumn  
months  <ARGM-TMP
)  
,  
but  
we  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
feel  V02
like  
we  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
go  V02
right  
in  
the  
middle  <ARGM-TMP
of  
summer  
either  <<<ARGM-ADV
.  

We  >>>ARG0
're  V01
both  >ARGM-ADV
in  
our  
early  
20s  <ARG2
and  
just  >ARGM-ADV
wanting  V01
to  
explore  V01
the  
beautiful  
country  <ARG1
while  
we  >>ARG1
're  V01
still  >ARGM-TMP
young  V01
and  
before  
our  
lives  >>>ARG1
start  V01
to  
get  V03
even  >ARGM-ADV
crazier  V03
!  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
anyone  >ARG0
give  V01
me  <ARG2
an  
idea  <ARG1
of  
when  >>ARG2
the  
best  
time  >>ARG1
for  
us  >ARG0
to  
go  V02
to  
Ireland  <ARG4
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
?  

People  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
to  
Ireland  <ARG4
on  
holiday  V01
for  
the  
weather  <<ARGM-PRP
,  
it  >>ARG1
is  V01
unpredictable  V01
.  

One  
thing  >>>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
sure  V02
of  <C-ARG1
about  
Irish  
weather  
is  V01
how  
little  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
sure  V02
of  <C-ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
shirtsleeves  <ARG2
and  
sunglasses  
in  
February  
,  
but  
winter  
woollies  
in  
March  
and  
even  
during  
the  
summer  
.  

And  
then  >ARGM-ADV
there  
’s  V02
the  
rain  <ARG1
.  

Ireland  >ARG0
receives  V01
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
rain  
,  
with  
certain  
areas  >>ARG1
getting  VLV
a  
soaking  V01
as  
many  
as  
270  
days  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
year  
.  

County  
Kerry  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
worst  
affected  <ARG2
.  

The  
southeast  >>ARG0
is  V01
the  
driest  <ARG2
,  
enjoying  V01
a  
more  
continental  
climate  <ARG1
.  

The  
Irish  
weather  
works  
on  
the  
‘  
four  
seasons  
in  
a  
day  
’  
principle  
,  
which  
basic­ally  
means  
that  
you  
ca  
n’t  
predict  
a  
thing  
when  
it  
comes  
to  
the  
behaviour  
of  
the  
sky  
.  

Some  
basic  >ARGM-ADJ
assumptions  V02
,  
however  
,  
can  
be  V03
made  VLV
.  

In  
summer  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
from  
May  >>>ARGM-TMP
to  
July  
,  
the  
days  >>>ARG1
are  V01
reasonably  >ARGM-EXT
warm  V07
and  
–  
most  
importantly  >ARGM-ADV
–  
very  >ARGM-EXT
long  V03
:  
at  
the  
height  >ARGM-TMP
of  
summer  
you  >>ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n’t  >ARGM-NEG
need  V01
to  
turn  V13
on  
lights  <ARG1
until  
after  
10  
pm  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
also  <ARGM-DIS
peak  
tourist  
season  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
means  V01
there  
are  V02
far  
more  
people  <ARG1
just  
about  
everywhere  <ARGM-LOC
but  
the  
most  
remote  
corners  
of  
the  
island  
,  
and  
prices  V01
are  V01
at  
their  
highest  <ARG2
.  

Not  
surprisingly  >ARGM-ADV
,  
most  >ARG1
of  
the  
yearly  
festivals  
occur  V01
during  
these  
times  <ARGM-TMP
so  
as  
to  
take  V01
advantage  <ARG1
of  
the  
crowds  <ARG2
and  
the  
more  
favourable  
weather  
.  

Spring  >ARG1
(  
February  
to  
April  
)  
and  
Autumn  
(  
August  
to  
October  
)  
make  V06
good  
alternatives  <ARG2
,  
although  
the  
country  
’s  
ever  
-  
growing  
popularity  >ARG0
as  
a  
tourist  
destination  
can  >ARGM-MOD
often  >ARGM-TMP
blur  V01
the  
lines  <ARG1
between  
mid  
-  
and  
high  
-  
season  
tourism  
.  

Still  >ARGM-ADV
,  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
better  >ARGM-ADJ
chance  V02
of  
some  
peace  V01
and  
quiet  
,  
and  
the  
weather  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
surprisingly  
better  <ARG2
in  
April  <ARGM-TMP
and  
September  
than  
in  
mid-July  <C-ARG2
–  
again  >ARGM-ADV
,  
it  >ARG1
’s  V01
all  <ARGM-ADV
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
uncertainty  
principle  
.  

Spring  
festivities  >ARG2
include  V01
the  
ever  
-  
popular  
St  
Patrick  
’s  
Festival  <ARG1
.  

Although  
temperatures  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
often  >ARGM-TMP
venture  V01
below  
freezing  V01
,  
winter  >>ARG0
(  
December  
to  
February  
)  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
brutal  V02
,  
for  
huge  
parts  <ARG2
of  
the  
country  
–  
the  
west  
and  
northwest  
in  
particular  
.  

Crowds  >ARG1
are  V01
at  
their  
thinnest  <ARG2
,  
but  
many  >>>ARG1
of  
the  
country  >>ARG0
’s  
tourist  >ARG1
attractions  V01
and  
services  V01
close  V04
down  
in  
October  <ARGM-TMP
and  
do  V01
n’t  >ARGM-NEG
reopen  V01
until  
Easter  <ARGM-TMP
,  
which  >ARG0
paradoxically  >ARGM-ADV
leaves  V13
visitors  <ARG1
with  
a  
more  
convincing  >ARGM-ADJ
taste  V01
of  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
Ireland  >>ARG1
is  V03
experienced  V01
by  
most  <ARG0
of  
the  
Irish  
:  
it  >>>ARG1
’s  V01
cold  V01
,  
grey  V02
and  
dark  V02
by  
5  
pm  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
there  
’s  V02
always  <ARGM-TMP
a  
pub  >ARGM-GOL
to  
escape  V01
into  <C-ARGM-GOL
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
rain  >>ARG1
starts  V01
sheeting  V01
down  <ARGM-PRD
.  

The  
thing  >>ARG1
to  
do  V02
is  V01
to  
bring  V01
the  
right  
clothing  <ARG1
with  
you  <ARGM-COM
,  
clothes  
so  
you  >>>ARG0
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
layer  V01
up  <ARGM-ADV
if  
it  >>ARG1
is  V01
cold  V01
and  
take  V07
off  
layers  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
warms  V02
up  
.  

Waterproof  
clothing  >>ARG1
and  
footwear  
are  V01
essential  V01
plus  
an  
umbrella  <C-ARG1
..  

As  
that  
famous  
Scotsman  >ARG0
Billy  
Connolly  
says  V01
"  
there  
is  V02
no  
such  
thing  <ARG1
as  
bad  
weather  
just  
the  
wrong  
clothes  
"  

Afraid  
I  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V01
more  >ARGM-ADV
helpful  V04
,  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
really  <ARGM-ADV
a  
case  V04
of  
pot  
luck  <ARG1
,  
although  
as  
the  
weather  >ARG1
is  V01
so  
changeable  >ARGM-CAU
often  >ARGM-TMP
a  
cold  
wet  
morning  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
turn  V02
into  
a  
lovely  
warm  
sunny  
afternoon  <ARG2
and  
evening  
or  
visa  
versa  
.  

If  
you  >ARG1
mean  V01
the  
Republic  <ARG2
of  
Ireland  
(  
Dublin  
)  
then  
anytime  
.  

The  
summer  >>ARG1
there  
is  V01
much  
more  >ARGM-CXN
mild  V01
than  
most  <C-ARGM-CXN
of  
the  
US  
(  
are  V03
you  >ARG1
coming  V01
from  
the  
US  <ARG3
?  
)  
.  

Their  
seasons  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
same  <ARG2
as  
all  
the  
countries  
in  
the  
Northern  
Hemisphere  
but  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
suggest  V01
fall  <ARG1
.  

It  >>>ARG1
does  V01
get  V03
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
cold  V01
in  
Ireland  <ARGM-LOC
so  >>ARGM-ADV
going  V02
before  
winter  <ARGM-TMP
is  V01
your  >ARG0
best  >ARGM-ADJ
bet  V01
.  

September  
for  
example  
.  

Rent  V01
a  
car  <ARG1
and  
spend  V02
a  
couple  
days  <ARG1
outside  
of  
Dublin  <ARGM-LOC
seeing  V01
the  
countryside  <ARG1
and  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
the  
trip  V03
of  
a  
lifetime  <ARGM-TMP
.  

To  
explore  V01
the  
beautiful  
countryside  <ARG1
you  >>>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
to  
be  V01
old  V01
enough  <ARGM-CXN
to  
hire  V01
a  
car  <ARG1
because  
public  >ARGM-ADJ
transport  V01
is  V01
expensive  V02
&  
only  >ARGM-ADV
goes  V01
as  
far  <ARG4
as  
the  
main  
towns  
/  
cities  
,  
most  
rural  
places  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
have  V03
a  
bus  >ARG1
or  
train  
service  V01
.  

You  >>>ARG0
could  >>>ARGM-MOD
stay  V01
in  
a  
city  <ARG3
&  
get  VLV
a  
bus  >ARGM-MNR
tour  V01
to  
say  
the  
Cliffs  <ARG1
of  
Moher  
or  
Dingle  
peninsula  
but  
you  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
with  
all  
the  
other  
tourists  <ARG2
.  

By  
definition  V01
most  
tourists  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
go  V02
to  
the  
best  
places  <ARG4
so  
you  >>ARG0
might  
have  V02
to  
put  V12
up  
with  
a  
few  
tourists  <ARG1
along  
the  
way  V01
.  

Best  
weather  >>ARG1
the  
past  
couple  
of  
years  
has  V01
been  V01
around  
late  
April  <ARG2
-  
late  
May  
but  
it  
can  >ARGM-MOD
pour  V02
with  
rain  <ARGM-MNR
for  
days  <ARGM-TMP
on  
end  
at  
any  
time  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
year  
so  >ARGM-ADV
be  V01
prepared  <ARG2
with  
waterproof  
jackets  <ARGM-MNR
/  
boots  
etc  <ARGM-MNR
.  

We  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
had  V03
a  
few  
sunny  
days  <ARG1
this  
summer  <ARGM-TMP
,  
barely  
24  
C  
on  
a  
few  >ARGM-ADJ
occasions  V02
,  
more  
like  
14  
C  
most  
days  
.  

We  >ARG0
used  V01
our  
BBQ  <ARG1
on  
precisely  
4  
occasions  V02
.  

Autumn  >ARG1
is  V01
from  
mid  
August  <ARG2
onwards  
as  
far  <ARGM-ADV
as  
the  
weather  >ARG1
goes  V01
if  
not  
officially  <<ARGM-ADV
according  
to  
the  
calender  
.  

The  
days  >>ARG1
start  V01
to  
shorten  V04
&  
it  >>ARG1
gets  V03
even  >ARGM-ADV
wetter  <ARG2
,  
windier  
&  
colder  V01
.  

We  >>ARGM-GOL
had  VLV
frosts  V01
in  
October  <ARGM-TMP
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
advise  V01
visiting  V01
late  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
year  
to  
be  V01
honest  V01
,  
Spring  
time  >ARG1
is  V01
your  >ARG0
best  >ARGM-ADJ
bet  V01
.  

You  >>ARG0
do  V01
realise  V01
it

I  >ARG0
have  V03
4  
Golden  
Wonder  
Killifish  <ARG1
.  

1  >>>ARG1
of  
them  
is  V01
really  
colorful  <ARG2
and  
is  V01
about  
6  
cm  >ARG2
long  V03
.  

2  >>>ARG1
of  
them  
are  V01
kinda  
whitish  <ARG2
and  
are  V01
about  
4  
-  
5  
cm  >ARG2
long  V03
.  

The  
last  
one  >ARG1
is  V01
colourful  <ARG2
too  <ARGM-DIS
but  
it  >>ARG1
is  V01
about  
4  
cm  >ARG2
long  V03
.  

I  >ARG0
feed  V01
them  <ARG2
Flakes  <ARG1
,  
and  
Live  
Earthworms  
uncut  
everyday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
tell  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
whole  >ARGM-ADJ
process  V02
of  
breeding  V01
them  <ARG1
and  
taking  VLV
care  V03
of  
the  
babies  <ARG1
?  

Thanks  V01
in  
Advance  V01
.  

Wow  
!  

If  
they  >>>ARG0
are  V01
able  V01
to  
take  V01
earthworms  <ARG1
uncut  <ARGM-PRD
,  
that  >>ARG0
is  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
impressive  V01
!  

I  >ARG0
aspire  V01
to  
your  
feeding  
regime  <ARG1
,  
flakes  
early  
and  
something  
live  
later  
in  
the  
day  
.  

Worms  >>>ARG0
(  
and  
Daphnia  
)  
are  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
rich  V01
in  
Lipids  <ARG2
,  
substances  
important  
in  
forming  V01
eggs  <ARG1
and  
growing  V01
young  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
that  
you  >ARG0
understand  V01
that  
your  
largest  
and  
smallest  
golden  
wonders  >ARG1
are  V01
males  <ARG2
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V01
more  <ARG1
on  
sexing  V03
out  <ARGM-PRD
Aplocheilus  
lineatus  <ARG1
take  VLV
a  
look  V01
at  
the  
discussion  V01
in  
the  
first  
source  <ARGM-LOC
below  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
plants  <ARG1
in  
your  
tank  
.  

your  
lineatus  >>ARG0
are  V03
already  >ARGM-TMP
spawning  V01
.  

If  
conditions  >ARG1
are  V01
favorable  >>>ARGM-ADV
(  
78  
-  
82  
F  
)  
and  
the  
fish  >ARG1
are  V01
obviously  <ARGM-ADV
well  
fed  <ARG2
as  
yours  >ARG1
are  V01
,  
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
spawn  V01
.  

(  
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
even  >ARGM-ADV
had  V03
a  
pair  >ARG0
of  
killies  
leave  V12
eggs  <ARG1
on  
a  
floating  
thermometer  <ARG2
!  

If  
you  >>ARG0
wish  V01
to  
pick  V01
eggs  <ARG1
make  V01
a  
acrylic  
spawning  
mop  <ARG1
.  

Check  V05
out  
the  
second  
source  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
prefer  V01
darker  
colors  <ARG1
because  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
their  
eggs  <ARG1
,  
more  
easily  <ARGM-ADV
and  
the  
fish  >>ARG1
look  V02
better  V02
next  <ARGM-LOC
to  
them  
.  

Use  V01
a  
well  >ARGM-MNR
rinsed  V01
medicine  
vial  <ARG2
,  
a  
cork  
,  
new  
fishing  
bobber  
or  
even  
a  
piece  
of  
non-crumbly  
styrofoam  
to  
float  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

There  
are  V02
a  
couple  
ways  >ARGM-MNR
one  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
spawn  V01
lineatus  <ARG1
-  
mop  >ARGM-MNR
spawning  V01
&  
water  >ARG2
incubating  V01
them  <ARG1
for  
two  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
,  
picking  V01
eggs  <ARG1
from  
a  
mop  <ARG2
&  
putting  V01
them  <ARG1
in  
a  
tray  <ARG2
of  
treated  
,  
seasoned  
water  
or  
setting  V03
up  
the  
parents  <ARG1
in  
a  
planted  V01
tank  <ARG1
&  
moving  V01
them  <ARG1
so  
the  
fry  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
hatch  V01
out  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
the  
room  >>ARGM-LOC
to  
separate  V01
the

(  
assuming  V02
that  
you  >>ARG0
are  V03
doing  V02
weekly  >ARGM-TMP

when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
put  V03
them  <ARG1

they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
leave  V02
a  
lot  
more  
eggs  <ARG1
.  

Just  >ARGM-ADV
making  V10
up  
examples  <ARG1
,  
but  
if  
a  
pair  >ARG1
is  V01
constantly  <ARGM-TMP
together  >ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
lay  V01
10  
-  
15  
eggs  <ARG1
a  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

With  
extra  
blackworms  >>>ARGM-MNR
and  
maybe  
frozen  
(  
defrosted  V01
,  
rinsed  V01
)  
frozen  
foods  <ARG2
earlier  
in  
the  
day  
,  
they  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
leave  V02
30  
-  
40  
eggs  <ARG1
at  
a  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Separated  V01
and  
feed  V01
extremely  
nourishing  
stuff  <ARG1
,  
they  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
produce  V01
more  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Separating  V01
a  
pair  <ARG1
some  
time  
before  
a  
show  V04
(  
killies  >>>ARG1
are  V03
usually  >>>ARGM-TMP
shown  V01
&  
judged  V01
&  
often  >ARGM-TMP
sold  V01
as  
pairs  <ARGM-PRD
)  
will  >ARGM-MOD
encourage  V01
them  >>ARG0
to  
court  V01
and  
show  V01
their  
best  
colors  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
start  V01
the  
day  <ARG1
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
nicks  <ARGM-MNR
or  
dings  V01
in  
their  
fins  <ARG1
.  

The  
water  >ARG1
changes  V01
help  V01
with  
that  <ARG1
too  <ARGM-DIS
.  

You  >>ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
may  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
to  
treat  V04
the  
incubation  
water  <ARG1
.  

The  
chlorine  >>ARG1
and  
ammonia  
(  
choramine  
)  
are  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
good  V04
for  
the  
eggs  <ARG2
.  

Ironically  >>ARGM-ADV
sometimes  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>>ARG0
is  V01
wise  V01
to  
leave  V14
the  
newly  
picked  
eggs  <ARG1
in  
fresh  
tap  
water  <ARG1
with  
some  
chlorination  V01
to  
kill  V01
microscopic  
critters  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
ride  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
with  
the  
eggs  <ARG1
.  

THEN  >ARGM-TMP
put  V01
the  
eggs  >>>ARG0
in  
water  >ARG1
treated  V04
a  
couple  
of  
days  
before  <ARGM-TMP
with  
a  
water  >ARG2
treatment  V04
and  
left  V14
open  V01
to  
"  
breathe  V01
"  
.  

Leaving  V12
a  
jar  <ARG1
with  
a  
dozen  
black  
worms  
in  
it  
will  >ARGM-MOD
sate  V01
the  
adult  
's  
desire  <ARG1
for  
snacks  
and  
they  >>>ARG0
are  V01
more  >ARGM-EXT
likely  V01
to  
leave  V14
fry  >ARG1
or  
eggs  
alone  V01
.  

If  
a  
pair  >>ARG0
is  V03
n't  >ARGM-NEG
leaving  V12
eggs  <ARG1
...  
check  V01
the  
following  <ARG1
:  

1  
.  
Is  V03
a  
tank

(  
such  
as  
another

a

rating  V01
the

.  
Have  V01
we  >ARG0

up  
with  
partial  >ARGM-EXT

?  

3  
.  
Is  V02
there  
too  
much  
mineral  <ARG1
in  
the

?  

Aplo.  
lineatus  >>ARG1
are  V01
wide  V01

spread  <C-V

southern

That  >ARG0
indicates  V01
that  
they  >ARG1

in  
different  
water

.  

Still  
if  
you  >ARG0

your

out  
what

be  V01
your  
hardness

(  
calcium  
,  
magnesium  
and  
iron

.  

A  
number  >ARG1
of  
minerals  
are  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
of  
much  
consequence  <ARG2
.  

However  >>>ARGM-DIS
if  
there  
is  V02
a  
high  
level  <ARG1
of  
sodium  
chloride  
(  
common

that  >>ARG0

break  V12
down  
the

(  
shell

around  
the  
egg  
and  
allow  V01
critters  >>ARG0
to  
get  V05
in  <ARG2
and  
eat  V01
the  
yoke  <ARG1
and  
embryo  
.  
)  

Ironically  >>ARGM-ADV
sometimes  >>ARGM-TMP
it  
is  V01
wise  V01
to  <ARG1
newly  
picked  
eggs  
in  
fresh  
tap  
water  
with  
some  
chlorination  V01

microscopic  
critters  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
ride  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
with  
the

THEN  >ARGM-TMP
put  V01
the  
eggs  <ARG1
in  
water  >>>ARG0
treated  V04
a  
couple  
of  
days  
before  <ARGM-TMP

a  
water  >ARG2
treatment  V04
and  
left  V12
open  V01

If  
you  >ARG0

eggs  <ARG1
in  
the  
mail  <ARGM-MNR
in  
a  
medicine  
vial  <ARGM-MNR
,  
that  >>ARG1
is  V01
fine  V04
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
get  V05
the  
eggs  <ARG1
out  <ARG2
,  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
rinsed  V01
in  
fresh  
tap  
water  <ARGM-LOC
and  
then  
into  
the  
incubation  
water  <ARGM-LOC

In  
time  >ARGM-TMP
the  
eggs  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
suffocate  V01
in  
the  
shipping  
container  <ARGM-LOC
.  

After  
a  
number  >ARG1
of  
people  
began  V02
complaining  <C-ARG1
about  
"  
mystery  >ARGM-ADJ
deaths  V01
"  
among  
incubating  
eggs  
,  
some  >>ARG0
of  
the  
more  
advanced  
killie  
people  
began  V02
suggesting  V01
that  
after  
7  
-  
8  
days  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
incubation  V01
,  
one  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
a  
100  
%  >ARGM-EXT
water  >ARG1
change  V01
-  
as  
the  
eggs  >ARG2
develop  V01
,  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
release  V01
waste  
material  <ARG1
.  

Another  
problem  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
bad  
eggs  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
fungus  V02
and  
the  
fungus  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
spread  V04
out  
and  
kill  V01
all  
the  
eggs  <ARG1
.  

Some  
people  >>ARG0
put  V01
in  <ARG2
a  
very  
dilute  
Acriflaven  
solution  <ARG1
to  
slow  V03
down  
the  
fungus  <ARG1
,  
so  
one  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
take  V01
white  
eggs  <ARG1
out  <ARGM-DIR
with  
a  
pipette  <ARGM-MNR
or  
eyedropper  
.  

Other  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
add  V02
a  
drop  <ARG1
of  
Methylene  
blue  
.  

If  
an  
egg  >>ARG1
turns  V02
blue  V01
,  
it  >>>ARG1
had  V01
died  V01
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
became  V01
dyed  <ARG2
as  
the  
outer  
membrane  >ARG1
broke  V12
down  
.  

Get  V05
those  <ARG1
out  <ARG2
ASAP  <ARGM-TMP
too  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Hope  V01
there  
is  V02
useful  
grist  <ARG1

special  
regions  >ARG1
uniquely  >ARGM-ADV

imposingly

They  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
spend  V02
many  
hours  <ARG1
enjoying  V01
the  
Disney

magic  <ARG1

These

facilities

It  >ARG1
is  V01
really  <ARGM-ADV
an  
entertainment  <ARG2
for  
the  
kids  
.  

The  
amusing  
world  >ARG1
of

stories  
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
memorable  >ARGM-ADJ

area

many  
such  
nice  
facilities  
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
one  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
keep  V01
their  
privacy  <ARG1
in  
the  
cabins  <ARGM-LOC
and  
make  V01
the  
time  <ARG1
in  
seclusion  V01
.  

To  
relax  V01
and  
to  
rejuvenate  V01
Disney  
cruise  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
best  
option  <ARG2
.  

There  
are  V02
many  
online  
sites  >ARG0
offering  V01
the  
booking  
facility  <ARG1
with  
affordable  
rates  
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
select  V01
the  
proper  
route  <ARG1
and  
travel  >ARG1
plans  V01
by  
consulting  V01
the  
agents  <ARG1
prior  
to  
the  
booking  <ARGM-TMP
........  

Off  
season  >>ARG1
is  V01
good  V02
,  
however  >ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
Disney  
cruises  >ARG1
are  V01
almost  
ALWAYS  <ARGM-TMP
completely  
booked  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
suggest  V01
a  
warmer  
season  <ARG1
,  
but  
not  
Spring  >ARG2
Break  V19
or  
early  
summer  
.  

You  >>ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
want  V01
to  
avoid  V01
Thanksgiving  
week  <ARG1
and  
the  
Christmas  >ARG3
holidays  V01
.  

We  >ARG0
REALLY  >ARGM-ADV
enjoyed  V01
our  
balcony  <ARG1
--  
coffee  
in  
the  
mornings  
,  
drinks  
at  
night  
,  
standing  V01
outside  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
docking  V01
and  
leaving  V11
port  <ARG1
--  
however  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
it  >>ARG1
is  V01
quite  
a  
bit  
more  >ARGM-EXT
expensive  V02
.  

With  
young  
ones  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
get  V01
a  
window  <ARG1
or  
view  
room  
so  
they  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
outside  <ARGM-DIR
.  

Check  V05
out  
the  
kids  
'  
space  <ARG1
as  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
as  
you  >ARG1
get  V05
onboard  <ARG2
.  

Do  V01
NOT  >>ARGM-NEG
feel  V01
guilty  V01
about  
taking  V01
them  <ARG1
there  <ARG3
.  

They  >>ARG0
have  VLV
a  
BLAST  V07
so  >>>ARGM-ADV
the  
sooner  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG1
get  V05
there  <ARG2
,  
the  
sooner  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
have  VLV
fun  V01
.  

We  >ARG0
liked  V01
getting  V01
the  
late  
dinner  
seating  <ARG1
,  
so  
you  >>ARG0
have  V03
more  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
see  V01
movies  <ARG1
and  
stuff  
but  
if  
your  
kids  >ARG1
are  V01
'  
early  >ARGM-ADV
to  
bed  
'  
you  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
want  V01
the  
earlier  
seating  <ARG1
for  
dinners  
.  

Bring  V01
some  
sort  <ARG1
of  
magnet  
or  
small  
magnetic  
whiteboard  
for  
your  
door  
.  

All  >>>ARG1
of  
the  
doors  
tend  V02
to  
look  V02
alike  V05
and  
having  V03
'  
something  <ARG1
'  
on  
your  
door  
helps  V01
you  >ARG0
and  
your  
kids  
find  V01
your  
room  <ARG1
easier  <ARGM-MNR
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
leave  V12
notes  <ARG1
for  
the  
rest  <ARG2
of  
your  
family  
(  
husband  
)  
about  
where  >ARG2
you  >ARG1
are  V01
at  
any  
given  
point  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Cell  
phones  >>ARG1
do  V01
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
work  V09
on  
board  <ARGM-LOC
but  
they  >ARG0
give  V01
you  <ARG2
a  
'  
walkie  
-  
talkie  
'  
kind  >ARG1
of  
phone  
in  
your  
room  
that  >R-ARG1
WILL  >ARGM-MOD
work  V09
onboard  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Each  
evening  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
a  
'  
magazine  >>ARG0
'  
called  V01
The  
Navigator  <ARG2
which  >R-ARG0
lists  V01
all  <ARG1
of  
the  
activities  
for  
the  
next  
day  
.  

We  >>ARG0
always  >>ARGM-TMP
took  V01
ours  <ARG1
to  
dinner  <ARG3
and  
discussed  V01
what  
things  >>>ARG1
we  >ARG0
felt  V02
we  >>ARG0
'  
had  V02
'  
to  
do  V02
and  
which  
ones  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
felt  V02
like  
skipping  V01
in  
lieu  <ARGM-ADV
of  
just  >ARGM-ADV
chilling  V02
.  

Any  
time  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
great  V01
.  

off  
season  
cruises  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V01
better  V02
with  
preschoolers  <ARGM-COM
as  
prices  V01
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
lower  V04
in  
the  
off  
season  <ARGM-TMP
.  

My  
wife  >ARG0
and  
I  
,  
in  
our  
60's  
at  
the  
time  
,  
originally  >ARGM-ADV
planned  V01
a  
3  
generation  >ARG0
trip  V03
but  
some  
family  
emergencies  >ARG0
caused  V01
everyone  >ARG0
else  
to  
cancel  V01
.  

We  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
ball  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
had  V03
an  
inside  
cabin  <ARG1
and  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend  V01
.  

There  
are  V02
so  
many  
things  >ARG1
to  
do  V02
that  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
use  V01
your  
room  <ARG1
for  
sleeping  V01
and  
the  
extra  
cost  >>ARG1
of  
the  
balcony  
is  V03
wasted  V01
.  

The  
children  >>>ARG0
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
checked  V02
in  <ARG1
and  
checked  V09
out  <ARG1
in  
a  
safe  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
at  
many  
activities  <<ARGM-LOC
so  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
a  
bit  <ARG1
of  
free  
time  
without  
the  
little  
ones  
.  

The  
range  >>ARG1
of  
activities  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
illustrated  V01
by  
describing  V01
the  
water  
activities  <ARG1
.  

There  
is  V02
a  
splash  
fountain  <ARG1
(  
no  
standing  
water  
)  
for  
little  
ones  
still  
in  
diapers  
;  
Next  >ARG2
is  V01
a  
wading  
pool  <ARG1
for  
those  >ARG1
who  >R-ARG1
are  V01
potty  
trained  <ARG2
;  
Then  
a  
family  
pool  
;  
Finally  >ARGM-ADV
there  
is  V02
a  
pool  <ARG1
for  
adults  
only  
with  
kids  >ARG1
not  >ARGM-NEG
allowed  V01
.  

You  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
so  
spoiled  <ARG2
in  
your  
life  <ARGM-TMP
as  
you  >ARG1
are  V01
on  
a  
Disney  
Cruise  <ARGM-LOC
.  

If  
you  >ARG1
stay  V01
with  
your  
dining  
schedule  <ARG3
,  
every  
night  >ARG1
is  V01
dinner  <ARG2
and  
a  
show  V04
.  

The  
real  
payoff  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
the  
same  
waiter  <ARG1
for  
the  
entire  
cruise  
.  

Our  
waiter  >ARG0
quickly  >ARGM-TMP
grasped  V01
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
I  >ARG0
like  V01
Ginger  
ale  <ARG1
and  
rather  
spicy  
foods  
while  
my  
wife  >ARG0
's  
taste  V01
ran  V04
to  
lemonade  <ARG4
and  
less  
spicy  
fare  
.  

Since  
they  >ARG0
knew  V01
our  >ARG0
preferences  V01
,  
we  >>>ARG1
almost  
always  >>>ARGM-TMP
went  V06
along  <ARG2
with  
their  >ARG0
menu  >ARG1
suggestions  V01
and  
were  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
sorry  V01
we  
did  V01
.  

Obviously  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
full  
beverage  
list  >ARG2
including  V01
alcohol  <ARG1
for  
adults  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
wanted  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
miss  V02
a  
meal  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
missed  V02
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
show  V04
.  

but  
food  >>ARG2
is  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
available  V02
and  
it  >>ARG1
is  V01
consistently  >ARGM-MNR
good  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
I  >ARG0
gained  V02
three  
pounds  <ARG1
in  
my  
week  
long  
cruise  <ARGM-TMP
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
about  
my  
farrier  <ARG2
,  
girls  <ARGM-DIS
.  

That  >ARG1
's  V01
why  >>ARGM-CAU
I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
posting  V01
here  <ARG2
!  

Help  V01
?  

I  >ARG0
posted  V01
this  <ARG1
in  
singles  <ARG2
and  
dating  V02
too  <<ARGM-DIS
,  
so  >>>ARGM-ADV
I  >>>ARG0
've  V01
just  >>ARGM-ADV
copied  V01
and  
pasted  V01
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
try  V01
to  
make  V02
this  >ARG1
short  V07
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
known  V02
this  
guy  <ARG1
for  
a  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
we  >>ARG1
've  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
been  V01
good  
friends  <ARG2
or  
anything  
.  

He  >ARG1
is  V01
my  
farrier  <ARG2
(  
shoes  V01
my  
horse  
s  
feet  <ARG1
)  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG1
am  V01
technically  <ARGM-ADV
a  
client  <ARG2
if  
you  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
view  V02
it  <ARG1
that  
way  V01
.  

Well  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
almost  
two  
weeks  
ago  >>>ARGM-TMP
he  >>>ARG1
came  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR
and  
did  V02
my  
horse  
s  
feet  <ARG1
and  
was  V01
SO  
flirty  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
hugs  V01
me  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG1
comes  V01
,  
but  
he  >>ARG0
gave  VLV
me  >ARG1
at  
least  
5  >ARGM-ADJ
tight  >ARGM-MNR
,  
long  >ARGM-ADJ
,  
back  
rubbing  >ARGM-MNR
hugs  V01
while  
he  >ARG1
was  V01
there  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG0
were  V03
also  >ARGM-DIS
just  >ARGM-ADV
talking  V01
about  
my  
horse  
's  
crappy  
feet  <ARG1
and  
he  >ARG0
mentioned  V01
.  

"  
Well  
,  
if  
you  >>ARG0
ever  >ARGM-TMP
just  >ARGM-ADV
want  V01
to  
see  V01
me  <ARG1
I  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
come  V09
out  
and  
look  V06
him  <ARG1
over  <C-V
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
grab  V01
a  
coffee  <ARG1
after  <ARGM-TMP
.  
"  

That  >>ARG1
has  V01
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
happened  V01
before  <ARGM-TMP
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
kinda  >ARGM-EXT
realizing  V01
at  
that  
point  <ARGM-TMP
that  
he  >>ARG1
was  V01
a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
interested  V01
.  

Right  
??  

Anyway  >ARGM-DIS
,  
so  >ARGM-DIS
he  >>>ARG0
ended  V03
up  
leaving  V03
one  
nail  <ARG1
out  
of  
my  
horse  
s  
foot  <ARG2
(  
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
heard  V01
of  
a  
farrier  >ARG0
doing  V02
this  <ARG1
)  
and  
telling  V01
me  >ARG0
to  
call  V02
him  <ARG1
in  
a  
few  
days  <ARGM-TMP
(  
first  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
week  <ARG2
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
few  
days  <ARG2
lol  <ARGM-DIS
)  
and  
he  >>ARG0
'd  >>ARGM-MOD
come  V01
back  
out  <ARG4
and  
put  V01
it  <ARG1
in  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
told  V01
me  >>ARG0
to  
remember  V01
to  
call  V02
like  <ARGM-DIS
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
before  
he  >ARG0
left  V11
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
waited  V01
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
to  
call  V02
because  
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
busy  V01
and  
I  >>ARG0
wanted  V01
to  
have  V04
him  >ARG1
come  V09
out  
on  
a  
day  <ARGM-TMP
when  
I  >>ARG2
am  V01
more  >ARGM-EXT
available  V02
in  
case  
we  >ARG1
were  V01
to  
hang  V06
out  
after  <ARGM-TMP
;)  

Anyway  
,  
so  >ARGM-DIS
that  >ARG1
was  V01
2  
days  
ago  >>ARGM-TMP
that  >>R-ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
called  V02
and  
left  V12
a  
message  <ARG1
,  
but  
he  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
has  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
called  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
yet  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
if  
I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
call  V02
him  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
tomorrow  <ARGM-TMP
or  
not  
?  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
a  
lot  >>ARG1
of  
people  
say  V01
to  
wait  V01
until  
he  >ARG0
calls  V02
you  <ARG1
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
's  V01
different  V02
because  
I  >ARG1
'm  V01
a  
client  <ARG2
and  
technically  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG1
's  V01
all  >ARG2
I  >ARG1
am  V01
at  
this  
point  <ARGM-TMP
.  

On  
the  
other  
hand  >>>ARGM-ADV
though  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
I  >ARG1
'm  V01
a  
client  >>ARGM-ADV
he  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
really  >>ARGM-ADV
of  V01
called  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
by  
now  <ARGM-TMP
because  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
leave  V14
a  
customer  >ARG1
hanging  V01
.  

He  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
my  
number  <ARG1
either  <ARGM-ADV
because  
this  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
first  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
called  V02
HIM  <ARG1
instead  
of  
his  
dad  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
father  
and  
son  
business  <ARG2
.  

Anyway  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
appreciate  V02
ANY  
insight  <ARG1
on  
this  
at  
all  
.  

Thank  V01
you  <ARG1
for  
reading  V01
if  
you  
did  V01
!  
:)  

Ok  
,  
well  
as  
far  >>>ARGM-ADV
as  
him  >ARG1
being  V01
a  
bad  
farrier  <ARG2
for  
leaving  V03
a  
nail  <ARG1
out  <C-V
-  
That  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
case  V04
,  
they  >ARG1
are  V01
extremely  
well  
known  
farriers  <ARG2
in  
the  
area  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
lot  
more  >ARGM-EXT
concerned  V01
if  
the  
shoe  >ARG1
fell  V01
off  <ARGM-DIR
because  
it  >>ARG0
was  V03
missing  V01
one  
lousy  
nail  <ARG1
.  

The  
reason  >>>ARG1
he  >ARG0
said  V01
he  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
put  V01
that  
nail  <ARG1
in  <ARG2
was  V01
because  
he  >>>ARG0
"  
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
risk  V01
it  <ARG1
"  
with  
my  
horse  
's  
horrible  
feet  <ARGM-CAU
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
about  
the  
fourth  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
've  V01
done  V02
my  
horse  
's  
feet  <ARG1
because  
I  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-TMP
switched  V01
back  <ARGM-ADV
to  
them  <ARG2
.  

The  
only  
reason  >>ARG1
I  >ARG1
switched  V01
away  <ARG3
from  
them  
in  
the  
first  
place  <ARGM-ADV
is  V01
because  
my  
good  
friend  >>>ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
apprenticed  V01
with  
them  <ARG2
was  V03
starting  V05
out  
on  
his  
own  <ARGM-MNR
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >ARG0
left  V14
my  
horse  <ARG1
without  
a  
shoe  <ARG1
for  
TWO  
WEEKS  <ARGM-TMP
(  
now  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG1
's  V01
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
call  V01
a  
crap  
farrier  <ARG2
)  
.  

Which  >>ARG1
,  
I  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
add  V01
is  V01
the  
same  
foot  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
keeps  V02
crumbling  V01
with  
the  
nails  <ARGM-ADV
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
,  
obviously  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
switched  V01
back  <ARG2
to  
these  
guys  
.  

Ok  >ARGM-DIS
,  
calm  V02
down  
,  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
like  
he  >ARG1
's  V01
some  
stranger  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
came  V13
up  
and  
groped  V01
me  <ARG1
lol  <<<ARGM-DIS
.  

I  >>ARG0
've  V01
known  V02
the  
guy  <ARG1
for  
about  
10  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG1
am  V01
21  <ARG2
,  
so  >ARGM-DIS
yeah  >ARGM-DIS
we  >ARG1
were  V01
both  <ARGM-ADV
kids  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
knew  V02
each  
other  <ARG1
!  

He  >>ARG1
is  V01
a  
few  
years  >ARGM-EXT
older  V01
than  
me  <ARGM-CXN
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
like  V01
him  <ARG1
.  

To  
answer  V01
Barry  <ARG1
White  
,  
yes  >>ARGM-DIS
that  >>ARG1
did  V01
occur  V01
to  
me  <ARG2
:)  
I  >ARG0
hope  V01
that  >ARG1
is  V01
all  >>ARG2
he  >>ARG1
's  V03
waiting  V01
for  <C-ARG2
.  

On  
the  
other  
hand  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
very  
easily  >>ARGM-MNR
just  >>ARGM-ADV
call  V02
me  <ARG1
and  
say  V01
hey  >>ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
busy  V01
right  
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
call  V02
you  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
come  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR
.  

And  >>>ARGM-DIS
as  
far  >>>ARGM-ADV
as  
scheduled  >ARGM-ADJ
visits  V01
go  V06
,  
I  >ARG0
have  V04
no  
idea  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
've  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
done  V02
that  <ARG1
before  <ARGM-TMP
though  <ARGM-DIS
either  <ARGM-DIS
.  

It  >>>ARG1
's  V01
always  <ARGM-TMP
just  <ARGM-ADV
"  
Okay  
,  
they're  
feet  >ARG0
need  V01
to  
be  V03
done  V02
,  
better  
call  V02
the  
farrier  <ARG1
.  
"  

And  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG1
usually  >ARGM-ADV
come  V09
out  
within  
a  
few  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
call  V02
you  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
I  >>ARG0
m  V01
sure  V02
!  

Sounds  V01
like  
He  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-EXT
likes  V01
you  <ARG1
..  

But  >ARGM-DIS
you  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
ask  V01
yourself  <ARG2
do  V01
you  >ARG0
feel  V01
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
?  

would  >ARGM-MOD
You  >>ARG0
like  V01
going  V02
for  
*  
coffee  <ARG1
*  
with  
him  <ARGM-COM
?  

or  
is  V01
he  <ARG1
Not  <ARGM-NEG
your  
type  <ARG2
?  

Or  >>ARGM-DIS
are  V01
you  >ARG0
undecided  V01
?  

If  
i  >ARG1
were  V01
you  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
Go  V02
...  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
if  
he  >>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
call  V02
you  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
by  
friday  <ARGM-TMP
call  V02
him  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
playing  V01
hard  V02
to  
get  V01
?  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
he  >>>ARG0
left  V03
the  
Nail  <ARG1
out  
of  
the  
shoe  <ARG2
as  
a  
excuse  V02
to  
come  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
and  
see  V01
you  <ARG1
hey  
he  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
your  
Prince  
charming  <ARG2
..  

Edit  
...  
I  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
Your  
horse  >ARG1
Is  V01
in  
danger  <ARG2
Of  
being  V03
hurt  V01
With  
one  
Nail  >ARG1
missing  V01
..  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
seen  V01
horses  >>ARG0
Loose  V02
Nails  <ARG1
On  
there  
Own  <ARGM-MNR
And  
do  V02
just  
fine  <ARGM-MNR
with  
ONE  
nail  >ARG0
gone  V02
Now  >>>ARGM-TMP
if  
he  >>ARG0
had  V01
left  V03
out  
2  <ARG1
or  
3  
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
wondering  V01
to  <ARG1
...  

I  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
belive  V01
he  >ARG0
left  V03
the  
nail  <ARG1
out  <C-V
becuse  
of  
the  
horse  
s  
Hoof  
condition  <ARGM-CAU
and  
It  
s  V01
a  
added  
bonus  <ARG2
he  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
get  V22
to  
see  V01
her  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP

When  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
Younger  V01
In  
my  
early  
20s  >ARGM-TMP
My  
farrier  >ARG1
was  V01
A  
hottie  >ARG1
named  V01
Joby  <ARG2
..  
(  
for  
those  >>>ARGM-ADV
who  >>R-ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
Know  V01
I  >ARG1
AM  V01
A  
GIRL  <ARG2
read  V01
my  
Bio  <ARG1
on  
my  
Page  
)  
dumb  
as  
a  
post  
about  
everything  
But  
horses  
..  

He  >>ARG0
was  V01
In  
his  
30s  <ARG2
divorced  
and  
Had  V03
2  
kids  <ARG1
..  
but  
we  >ARG0
both  
flirted  V01
Horribly  <ARGM-ADV
with  
each  
other  <ARG1
..  
but  
neither  
one  >>>ARG0
of  
us  
took  VLV
the  
chance  V02
and  
Asked  V02
to  
other  <ARG2
on  
a  
date  <ARG1
.  
:(  

sort  
a  >ARGM-ADV
wonder  V01
what  >>ARG2
it  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V01
like  <C-ARG2
?  

But  >ARGM-DIS
That  >ARG1
was  V01
Years  
ago  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
had  V03
this  
Habit  <ARG1
of  
telling  V01
you  <ARG2
Everything  <ARG1
..  

Well  
one  
day  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
said  V01
to  
me  <ARG2
You  >ARG0
know  V01
i  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
wear  V01
Underwear  <ARG1
as  
he  >>>ARG0
was  V03
bent  V01
over  <ARGM-DIR
Working  V01
on  
my  
Mare  
s  
Right  
front  
hoof  <ARG1
..  
and  
I  >ARG1
was  V01
Like  <ARGM-DIS
Ummmm  <ARG2
okay  
???  

I  >>ARG1
m  V01
glad  V02
his  
butt  >>ARG0
was  V03
facing  V01
me  <ARG1
so  
he  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see  V01
my  
red  
face  <ARG1
I  >ARG0
think  V01
my  
Mare  >>ARG0
was  V03
even  >ARGM-ADV
laughing  V01
..  

Well  
6  
weeks  
Later  >>>ARGM-TMP
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG1
came  V01
back  
out  <ARGM-DIR
He  >>ARG0
was  V03
again  >ARGM-TMP
working  V01
on  
my  
mare  
s  
front  
Foot  <ARG1
and  
I  >ARG0
looked  V01
Down  <ARGM-DIR
and  
Yeah  >ARGM-DIS
he  >ARG0
had  V03
Wholes  <ARG1
In  
his  
pants  
In  
the  
wrong  
places  
I  >>ARG0
bust  V03
out  
Laughing  V01
and  
He  >ARG1
was  V01
like  <ARGM-DIS
what  <ARG2
???  

I  >ARG1
was  V01
like  <ARGM-DIS
Ummmm  >ARGM-DIS
i  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
your  
ass  
cheeks  <ARG1
...  
he  >ARG1
was  V01
like  <ARGM-DIS
Oops  >>ARGM-DIS
did  V01
i  >ARG0
forget  V01
my  
Underwear  <ARG1
???  

that  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
strange  >ARGM-MNR
way  V01
to  
flirt  V01
..  
but  
i  >ARG0
guss  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
his  >ARG0
way  V01
...  

But  
like  
i  >ARG0
said  V01
nothing  >ARG1
ever  >ARGM-TMP
came  V03
of  
It  <ARG2
..  
the  
next  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
saw  V01
him  <ARG1
He  >>ARG0
had  V01
told  V01
Me  <ARG2
he  
had  V02
To  
get  V03
married  V01
to  
a  
girl  >ARG3
Who  >R-ARG3
he  >ARG0
worked  V01
with  <C-ARG3
becuse  
he  >ARG0
knocked  V09
Her  <ARG1
Up  <C-V
..  

I  >>ARG0
was  V01
heartbroken  <ARG2
..  
but  
then  >ARGM-TMP
realized  V01
He  >ARG1
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
Guy  <ARG2
for  
me  
..  

Wow  
he  >>>ARG1
does  V01
sound  V01
interested  V01
in  
you  <ARG2
,  
my  
farrier  >>ARG0
never  >>ARGM-NEG
gives  VLV
me  >ARG1
hugs  V01
like  
that  <ARGM-MNR
(  
probably  
a  
good  
thing  
as  
he  >ARG0
has  V03
a  
wife  <ARG1
and  
2  
kids  
)  
anyway  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
find  V02
that  
they  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
busy  V01
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
wait  V01
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
lo9nger  
and  
if  
still  
no  >ARGM-NEG
reply  V01
give  VLV
him  >ARG1
a  
call  V02
but  
do  V01
n’t  >ARGM-NEG
leave  V12
a  
message  <ARG1
so  
you  >>>ARG1
do  V01
n’t  
have  V02
to  
necessarily  >ARGM-ADV
wait  V01
for  
him  >ARG0
to  
call  V02
.  

From  
the  
point  >>>ARGM-ADV
of  
view  V02
of  
a  
business  <ARG0
,  
and  
client  >ARG0
/  
operator  
relationships  V03
,  
he  >>ARG0
's  V03
doing  V02
a  
really  
shitty  
job  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Leaving  V03
nails  <ARG1
out  <C-V
so  
you  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
call  V02
and  
have  V04
him  >ARG1
come  V01
back  
out  <ARGM-DIR
later  <ARGM-TMP
?  

Cute  V01
or  
not  
,  
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
call  V02
a  
different  
bloke  <ARG1
because  
he  >>ARG0
's  V03
doing  V02
a  
sub-par  
job  <ARGM-MNR
at  
something  >>>ARG1
he  >>>ARG0
needs  V01
to  
be  V03
doing  V02
his  
best  <ARGM-MNR
at  <C-ARG1
,  
whether  
he  >>>ARG0
's  V03
flirting  V01
or  
trying  V01
to  
ask  V04
you  <ARG1
out  <C-V
or  
not  
,  
he  >ARG0
ought  
to  
put  V03
quality  <ARG1
first  <ARG2
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
after  
all  <ARGM-ADV
,  
his  
business  <ARG2
,  
and  
if  
he  >ARG0
wants  V01
you  >ARG1
to  
remain  V01
a  
customer  <ARG3
why  >>>ARGM-CAU
on  
earth  
is  V03
he  >>ARG0
doing  VLV
shoddy  >ARGM-MNR
work  V01
?  

EPM  >ARGM-DIS
,  
Anyone  >ARG0
Dealt  V01
with  
it  <ARG2
?  

Might  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
something  <ARG2
different  
?  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
the  
opportunity  <ARG1
to  
pick  V04
up  
a  
super  
nice  
6  
year  
old  <ARG1
for  
free  <ARG3
.  

He  >>ARG1
's  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
lame  V01
,  
but  
he  >>>ARG1
's  V03
been  V03
having  VLV
issues  V02
.  

Here  >ARG2
's  V01
what  >>ARG1
the  
owner  >>ARG0
has  V01
said  V01
:  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
5  
year  
old  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
lost  V02
all  <ARG1
of  
his  
cheek  
muscle  
on  
the  
right  
side  
about  
3  
-  
4  
months  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
chalked  V02
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
to  
possible  >ARGM-ADJ
nerve  >ARG1
damage  V01
,  
because  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
what  >ARG1
the  
vet  >ARG0
thought  V01
and  
the  
other  
cheek  
muscle  >>ARG1
was  V01
fine  V04
and  
he  >ARG0
had  V03
no  
theeth  
problems  <ARG1
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
sent  V02
him  <ARG1
to  
the  
trainers  <ARGM-DIR
the  
first  <ARGM-TMP
of  
September  
to  
be  V03
started  V01
on  
the  
barrels  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
got  V01
him  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-ADV
the  
first  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
month  
and  
he  >>>ARG1
had  V01
lost  V02
some  
weight  <ARG1
but  
attributed  V01
that  <ARG1
to  
be  V03
worked  V01
everyday  <ARGM-TMP
(  
I  >ARG0
expected  V01
him  >ARG0
to  
drop  V01
some  <ARG1
)  
.  

He  >>>ARG0
is  V03
now  >ARGM-TMP
losing  V02
the  
cheek  
muscle  <ARG1
on  
the  
left  
side  <ARGM-LOC
of  
his  
face  
and  
seems  V01
to  
be  V03
dropping  V01
weight  <ARG1
by  
the  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Had  V04
him  <ARG1
to  
a  
dentist  <ARG1
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
and  
there  
is  V02
no  
teeth  
problems  <ARG1
.  

He  >>>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
eat  V01
all  
his  
feed  <ARG1
and  
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
drop  V01
any  <ARG1
,  
but  
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
eat  V01
hay  <ARG1
from  
lack  V01
of  
muscle  >ARGM-MNR
to  
chew  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

He  >>>ARG0
is  V01
gant  
looking  <ARG2
in  
his  
flank  
area  <ARGM-LOC
and  
is  V03
losing  V02
topline  
muscle  <ARG1
.  

The  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
neurological  >ARGM-MNR
sign  V07
that  >R-ARG1
he  >ARG0
shows  V01
is  V01
that  
he  >>ARG0
barely  >ARGM-ADV
drags  V01
his  
toes  <ARG1
and  
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
has  V03
trouble  <ARG1
with  
his  
right  
lead  
.  

The  
horse  >>>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
had  V01
posted  V01
about  <C-ARG1
a  
couple  
weeks  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
with  
the  
atrophied  V01
cheek  
muscles  <ARG1
is  V01
down  
to  
his  >ARG0
last  >ARGM-TMP
resort  V01
for  
life  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
CAN  >ARGM-MOD
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
afford  V01
to  
treat  V03
whatever  >>ARG1
is  V01
wrong  V02
with  
him  <ARG2
.  

NO  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
not  
done  VLV
an  
EPM  >ARG2
test  V01
but  
have  V01
done  V08
an  
extensive  
blood  
panel  <ARG1
and  
my  
vet  >ARG0
did  V02
a  
neurological  
physical  
exam  <ARG1
.  

We  >>ARG0
elected  V02
to  
not  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
the  
EPM  >ARG2
test  V01
because  
there  
was  V02
NO  >ARGM-NEG
neurological  >ARGM-MNR
signs  V07
.  

He  >>ARG0
is  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
showing  V01
no  >ARGM-NEG
signs  V07
other  <ARGM-ADJ
than  
the  
weight  >ARG1
loss  V02
,  
and  
some  
muscle  
atrophy  
.  

He  >ARG0
eats  V01
all  <ARG1
of  
his  
grain  
but  
it  
just  >ARGM-ADV
takes  V10
him  <ARG2
a  
while  <ARG1
to  
get  V04
it  >ARG1
chewed  V01
because  
of  
the  
lack  V01
of  
muscle  <ARG1
in  
his  
jaws  
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
get  V01
the  
horse  <ARG1
and  
see  V01
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
.  

I  >>>ARG0
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
getting  V04
with  
my  
vet  <ARG1
first  <ARGM-TMP
and  
if  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
get  V01
him  <ARG1
,  
have  V04
the  
spinal  
fluid  >ARG1
test  V01
done  VLV
for  
EPM  <<ARG2
and  
a  
titer  >ARG1
test  V01
.  

Will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
getting  V01
a  
copy  V01
of  
the  
blood  
results  >>ARG1
the  
owner  >>ARG0
has  V01
already  >ARGM-TMP
ran  V01
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

My  
other  
theory  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
wobblers  <ARG2
.  

I  >>>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
having  V04
my  
equine  
chiro  
/  
acupuncturist  <ARG1
out  
to  
do  VLV
some  >ARGM-EXT
work  V01
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
if  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
get  V01
him  <ARG1
....  

So  
any  
ideas  
?  

Think  V01
I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
it  <ARG1
?  

Arby  
,  

Horse  >>ARG1
is  V01
out  
of  
state  <ARG2
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
local  V02
.  

Owner  >>>ARG0
is  V01
willing  V02
to  
meet  V03
me  <ARG1
half  
way  <ARGM-EXT
with  
him  <ARGM-COM
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
calling  V02
my  
vet  <ARG1
and  
chiro  
about  
him  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Worse  >ARG1
comes  V04
to  
worse  <ARG2
,  
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V01
out  
of  
the  
$  
$  <ARG2
and  
have  V02
to  
put  V03
him  <ARG1
down  <ARG2
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
or  
have  V03
a  
pretty  
pasture  
ornament  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
's  V01
still  <ARGM-TMP
rideable  <ARG2
currently  <ARGM-TMP
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
having  V03
many  >ARGM-ADJ
issues  V02
under  
saddle  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
horse  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
I  >>>ARG0
otherwise  >>ARGM-ADV
would  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V01
able  V01
to  
afford  V01
and  
even  
if  
I  >ARG0
spend  V01
2  
K  <ARG3
and  
treatment  V03
I  >ARG1
come  V09
out  
ahead  
of  
his  >ARG1
purchase  >ARG1
price  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
posted  V01
what  >>ARG1
the  
owner  >>ARG0
as  V03
said  V01
in  
paragraph  <ARGM-LOC
2  
&  
3  
,  
that  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
me  <ARG2
to  
clarify  V10
.  

She  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
one  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
afford  V01
to  
do  V02
anything  <ARG1
else  
for  
him  <ARG2
in  
case  
he  >>ARG1
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
recover  V01
fully  <ARGM-EXT
.  

He  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
eat  V01
grain  <ARG1
and  
I  >ARG0
already  >ARGM-TMP
have  V03
a  
feed  
regimen  <ARG1
in  
my  
head  <ARGM-LOC
for  
the  
guy  <ARGM-GOL
since  
he  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
eat  V01
regular  
hay  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
it  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
hard  V02
to  
keep  V04
his  
weight  <ARG1
up  <ARG2
so  
long  <<<ARGM-ADV
as  
he  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
eat  V01
the  
grain  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
am  V03
not  
going  V04
to  
go  V05
pick  V04
up  
a

n't  >ARGM-NEG

I  >>>ARG0
am  V01
willing  V02
to  
pull  V01
the  
EPM  >ARG2
test  V01
and  
treat  V03
.  

The  
owner  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
one  >>ARG1
who  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
unable  V01

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
also  >>ARGM-DIS
be  V03

up  <ARG1
who  >R-ARG1

a

acupuncturist  
to  
evaluate  V01
him  <ARG1
for  
wobblers  <ARG2

July  >>>ARG0
is  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >C-ARG1
started  V01
to  
exhibit  V01
slight  
symptoms  <ARG1
and  
the  
owner  >ARG0
and  
vet  
originally  >ARGM-TMP
thought  V01
it  >ARG1

from  
something  <ARG0
in  
the

with  
no  >ARGM-NEG

.  

He  >>ARG0
's  V03
only  >ARGM-ADV
exhibited  V01
weight  >ARG1
loss  V02
and  
some  
muscle  
atrophy  
,  
with  
the  
slight  >ARGM-ADJ
toe  >ARG1

a  
bit  >>ARG1
of  
trouble  
with  
the

(  
which  >>R-ARG1
could

The

The

is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
in  
pain  <ARG2
.  

He  >>ARG1
's  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
starving  V01
.  

He  >>ARG0
's  V03
dropping  V01
weight  <ARG1
,  
but  
most  >>>ARG1
of  
that  
came  V01
from  
being  V01
at  
the  
trainer  <ARG2
s  
and  
being  V03
ridden  V01
hard  <ARGM-MNR
for  
60  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >>ARG0
's  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
putting  V01
it  <ARG1
back  
on  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
that  
I  >ARG0
have  V03
the  
possibility  <ARG1
of  
treating  V03
him  <ARG1
and  
still  
having  V02
to  
put  V03
him  <ARG1
down  <ARG2
.  

At  
the  
same  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
know  V02
people  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
have  V01
had  V03
horses  >ARG1
come  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
successfully  <ARGM-MNR
after  
EPM  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
this  >>>ARG1
is  V03
going  V04
to  
be  V01
expensive  V02
.  

I  >>>ARG0
'm  V01
willing  V02
to  
give  VLV
it  >ARG2
a  
shot  V01
.  

Gallop  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>>ARG0
've  V01
already  >>>ARGM-TMP
read  V01
that  
whole  
site  <ARG1
and  
been  V03
reading  V01
through  
research  
articles  <ARG1
from  
the  
research  
colleges  
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

Looked  V01
at  
studies  V01
,  
treatment  
options  
and  
such  
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
have  V04
the  
EPM  >ARG2
test  V01
done  VLV
before  
treating  V03
.  

The  
chiro  
/  
acupuncturist  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
there  <ARG2
to  
evaluate  V01
the  
horse  <ARG1
for  
wobblers  >>>ARG2
which  >>>R-ARG2
is  V03
often  >ARGM-TMP
caused  V01
by  
spinal  >ARG1
compression  V01
and  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
confused  V01
with  
EPM  <ARG3
.  

If  
that  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
case  <ARG2
then  
acupuncture  >>>ARG0
is  V03
n't  
going  V04
to  
hurt  V01
him  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
actually  <ARGM-ADV
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
alternative  
therapies  
for  
EPM  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
it  
is  V01
wonderfully  >ARGM-ADV
responsible  V03
that  
you  >>>ARG0
are  V03
going  V02
into  
this  
rescue  V01
eyes  >ARG1
open  V01
and  
are  V03
getting  V01
the  
opinions  <ARG1
of  
qualified  
professionals  
(  
and  
a  
bunch  
of  
Yahoos  
)  
before  
you  >>ARG0
decide  V01
to  
take  V09
this  
horse  <ARG1
on  <C-V
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
think  V01
some  
Y!A  
users  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
work  V01
on  
their  >ARG0
reading  >ARG1
comprehension  V01
as  
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
comprehend  V01
how  >>>ARGM-MNR
taking  V06
a  
horse  <ARG1
in  <C-V
as  
a  
rescue  V01
and  
getting  V01
it  <ARG4
qualified  >ARGM-ADJ
medical  >ARGM-ADJ
treatment  V03
is  V01
abuse  V01
.  

Worst  
case  
scenario  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG1
fall  V07
in  
love  V01
and  
after  
spending  V01
thousands  <ARG3
of  
dollars  
you  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
put  V03
the  
horse  <ARG1
down  <ARG2
.  

Is  V01
that  <ARG1
something  <ARG2
you  >ARG1
are  V01
up  <ARG2
for  
?  

If  
so  >ARGM-ADV
go  V03
for  
it  <ARG1
and  
I  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
give  VLV
you  >ARG1
all  
the  
moral  >ARGM-ADJ
support  V01
I  
can  <ARGM-ADJ
as  
you  >ARG0
figure  V05
out  
what  >ARG1
is  V01
up  <ARG2
.  

It  
is  V01
heartbreaking  <ARG2
to  
try  V01
to  
bring  V01
a  
horse  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
and  
then  
have  V02
to  
put  V03
it  <ARG1
down  <ARG2
,  
but  
some  
horses  >>ARG1
are  V01
worth  V02
the  
risk  V01
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
feel  V02
this  
guy  >>ARG1
is  V01
worth  V02
it  <ARG2
then  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
hope  V01
your  
vet  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
figure  V05
things  <ARG1
out  <C-V
.  

As  
to  
EPM  
like  
Shee  >>ARG1
said  V01
being  V01
in  
MI  <ARG2
we  >>>ARG0
've  V01
had  V02
to  
deal  V01
with  
it  <ARG2
.  

Pretty  
much  
every  
large  
stable  
has  V01
here  
.  

Our  
first  
diagnosed  
EPM  
horse  >ARG1
was  V01
back  
when  >ARGM-TMP
there  
was  V02
no  
treatment  V03
in  
the  
US  <ARGM-LOC
and  
only  
an  
experimental  
chicken  
feed  
additive  
in  
Canada  
.  

We  >>ARG0
hauled  V01
the  
horse  <ARG1
to  
Windsor  <ARGM-DIR
and  
got  V04
him  >ARG1
treated  V03
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

That  
horse  >ARG1
returned  V01
to  
racing  V02
and  
we  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
notice  V01
much  >ARGM-EXT
difference  V02
.  

We  >>ARG0
've  V01
had  V03
a  
few  <ARG1
since  
then  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
none  
since  
our  
race  
horses  >>ARG0
began  V02
wintering  V01
in  
Florida  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
no  
idea  <ARG1
if  
that  >>ARG1
is  V01
related  V01
or  
farmers  >>>ARG0
are  V03
doing  V02
a  
better  
job  <ARG1
of  
clearing  V05
out  
opossums  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
because  
they  >ARG0
know  V01
opossums  >ARG1
are  V01
carriers  <ARG2
,  
but  
we  >>ARG0
have  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
had  V03
an  
EPM  
horse  <ARG1
in  
at  
least  
10  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
all  >>>ARG1
of  
our  
EPM  
horses  
were  V03
treated  V03
early  <ARGM-TMP
when  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
were  V03
showing  V01
mild  >ARGM-EXT
signs  V07
like  
Shee  >ARG0
gave  V01
and  
all  >C-ARG1
returned  V01
to  
racing  V02
.  

One  
horse  >>>ARG1
even  >ARGM-ADV
got  V01
his  >ARG0
lifetime  >ARG1
mark  V02
after  
being  V03
treated  V03
for  
EPM  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG0
've  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
liked  V01
big  
long  
trotters  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
do  V02
better  <ARGM-MNR
on  
mile  
tracks  <ARGM-LOC
then  
1  
/  
2  
mile  <ARGM-ADV
.  

The  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
difference  V02
we  >ARG0
noticed  V01
is  V01
that  
the  
EPM  
horses  >>ARG0
seemed  V01
to  
do  V02
worse  <ARGM-MNR
on  
the  
smaller  
tracks  <ARGM-LOC
after  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
be  V01
coincidence  <ARG2
or  
the  
fact  
those  
great  
big  
trotters  >ARG0
with  
those  
extremely  
long  
backs  
lost  V02
a  
bit  <ARG1
of  
fine  >ARGM-ADJ
coordination  V01
to  
get  V05
those  
gangly  
bodies  <ARG1
around  
those  
tighter  >ARGM-ADJ
turns  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
.  

MSU  >ARG0
does  V02
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
EPM  >ARG1
studies  V01
because  
of  
how  
common  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
is  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

You  >>ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
want  V01
to  
see  V01
if  
you  >>>ARG0
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
get  V04
in  
touch  V01
with  
their  
EPM  
group  <<ARGM-COM
and  
get  V04
this  
guy  <ARG1
in  
a  
study  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
they  >ARG0
did  V02
lab  >ARG0
work  V01
showing  V01
that  
Strongid  
C  >>>ARG0
used  V01
daily  <ARGM-TMP
could  >ARGM-MOD
help  V01
prevent  V01
EPM  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
believe  V01
they  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
real  >ARGM-ADJ
study  V01
testing  V01
the  
lab  >ARG0
work  V01
in  
real  
world  
situations  <<ARGM-LOC
now  <<<ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
some  
time  <ARG2
before  
those  
results  >>ARG1
are  V03
released  V01
.  

Another  
thought  V01
with  
this  >ARG1
being  V01
a  
mosquito  
season  >ARGM-ADV
from  
hell  
could  >ARGM-MOD
it  >ARG1
be  V01
West  
Nile  <ARG2
?  

West  
Nile  >>>ARG2
can  >ARGM-MOD
cause  V01
EPM  
like  
symptoms  <ARG1
and  
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
always  >ARGM-TMP
include  V01
a  
fever  <ARG1
.  

Let  V01
us  >ARG0
know  V01
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
decide  V01
to  
do  V02
.  

You  >>ARG0
hate  V01
to  
see  V01
talent  >>ARG1
get  V03
wasted  V01
,  
but  
honestly  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
take  V06
in  
a  
horse  <ARG1
right  
now  <ARGM-TMP
these  
issues  V02
.  

Personally  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
think  V01
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
keep  V02
on  
walking  V01
by  <ARGM-DIR
.  

You  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
have  V04
you  
chiro  <ARG1
out  <ARG1
before  
you  >ARG0
decide  V01
if  
you  >ARG0
want  V01
this  
horse  <ARG1
or  
not  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
good  
repoire  <ARG1
(  
which  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
sure  V02
you  
do  V01
)  
with  
them  
,  
they  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
honest  V01
on  
if  
this  
horse  >ARG1
is  V01
fixable  <ARG2
to  
any  
degree  <ARGM-EXT
...  
not  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-ADV
sure  V02
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
do  V02
with  
him  <ARG2
...  

Even  
if  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
figure  V05
out  
what  >>ARG1
is  V01
wrong  V02
with  
this  
poor  
poneh  <ARG2
,  
there  
is  V02
always  <ARGM-TMP
the  
chance  V02
for  
remission  V02
and  
then  
relapse  
so  
you  
may  
have  V02
to  
do  V02
deal  V01
with  <ARG2
again  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
future  <ARGM-TMP
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
all  >ARGM-ADV
in  
all  
,  
put  V01
the  
money  <ARG1
up  
front  <ARG2
before  
taking  V09
on  V_
this  
horse  <ARG1
.  

A  
few  
hundred  >ARG3
out  
of  
pocket  
now  
will  >ARGM-MOD
possibly  >ARGM-ADV
save  V01
you  <ARG2
thousands  <ARG1
once  
the  
horse  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
your  
name  <ARG2
.  

Could  >>>ARGM-MOD
he  >>>ARGM-GOL
have  V01
had  VLV
a  
blow  V14
to  
the  
head  <ARG1
causing  V01
this  
atrophy  <ARG1
?  

Or  
a  
difficult  >ARGM-MNR
birth  V02
?  

Was  
it  
always  
like  
this  
?  

Or  
has  V01
it  >ARG1
occurred  V01
since  
birth  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
wonder  V01
if  
he  
might  
have  V01
had  VLV
a  
slight  >ARGM-EXT
stroke  V02
?  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
if  
you  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
afford  V01
to  
get  V04
him  >ARG1
treated  V03
that  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
consider  V02
him  <ARG1
as  
a  
prospect  V02
.  

Who  >ARG0
knows  V01
what  >ARG1
the  
future  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
hold  V13
,  
and  
it  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
expensive  V02
?  

Extremely  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
customer  >ARG2
service  V02

Do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
to  
this  
salon  <ARG4
,  
especially  
if  
you  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
get  V04
your  
hair  >ARG1
straightened  V01
.  

They  >>>ARG0
did  V02
a  
very  
bad  
job  <ARG1
with  
my  
hair  <ARG2
and  
were  V01
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
rude  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
went  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
to  
ask  V01
them  <ARG2
why  >>ARGM-CAU
it  >>ARG1
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
work  V09
for  
my  
hair  <ARG2
.  

Rude  
,  
insensitive  
,  
discourteous  
people  
!!!!!  

Great  
Doc  

Dr  >>>ARG0
Greenwalt  
fixed  V02
my  
neck  <ARG1
from  
a  
snowboard  >ARG2
injury  V01
and  
was  V01
way  >ARGM-EXT
more  >ARGM-CXN
effective  V04
that  
a  
regular  
doctor  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

He  >>ARG0
did  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
prescribe  V02
pain  
meds  <ARG1
or  
other  
drugs  
,  
he  >ARG0
used  V01
his  
bodytalk  
method  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
unusual  V01
but  
the  
results  >ARG1
are  V01
undeniable  <ARG2
.  

My  
neck  >>ARG1
is  V01
fixed  V02
!.  

He  >ARG0
knows  V01
what  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
s  V03
doing  V02
.

all  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
we  >ARG0
ask  V02
and  
10  
times  
more  
.  

The  
food  >ARG1
was  V01
out  
standing  <ARG2
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
need  V01
a  
cater  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
is  V01
affordable  V03
and  
easy  V05
to

ones  <ARG2

Excellent  
Tattoo  
Shop  

I  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
got  V04
a  
tattoo  >ARG1
done  V02
at  
Aztec  <ARGM-LOC
and  
I  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V01
happier  V01
.  

It  >>ARG1
came  V09
out  
better  V02
than  
I  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
imagined  V01
.  

The  
shop  >>ARG1
was  V01
great  V01
,  
the  
service  V02
was  V01
excellent  V02
and  
the

I  >ARG0

get  V04
a

Good  
and  
Bad  

I  >>>ARG0
had  V02
to  
take  VLV
care  V03
of  
the  
ants  <ARG1
myself  <ARGM-REC
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
found  V02
the  
location  >ARG1
wonderful  V03
and  
the  
neighbors  >ARG0
very  >ARGM-EXT
kind  V01
.  

Never  >ARGM-NEG
had  V03
a  
problem  <ARG1
with  
the  
staff  
and  
found  V02
them  >ARG0
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful  V04
when  >>ARGM-TMP
something  >>ARG2
went  V06
wrong  V04
.  

Loved  V01
the  
pool  <ARG1
and  
BBQ  
.  

Because  
of  
the  
ants  >ARGM-CAU
I  >ARG0

them  <ARG1
to  
a

here  
is  V01
fresh  V04
and  
hot  V05
out  
of  
the  
Wok  <ARGM-DIR
.  

The  
food  >>ARG1
is  V03
cooked  V01
fast  <ARGM-MNR
by  
the  
two  
chefs  <ARG0
on  
duty  
.  

The  
lunch  
specials  >ARG1
are  V01
more  
food  <ARG2
than  
most  
people  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
eat  V01
for  
about  
$  <<ARGM-ADV
6  
.  

It  >>ARG1
is  V01
busy  V01
every  
day  <ARGM-TMP
at  
lunch  
for  
a  
reason  <ARGM-CAU
,  
the  
service  V02
is  V01
fast  V02
and  
the  
food  >>ARG1
is  V01
great  V01
.  

Pure  
Pilates  
!!  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
real  
thing  <ARG2
-  
I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
practicing  V01
Pilates  <ARG1
for  
over  
7  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
anywhere  <ARG4
else  
.  

It  
is  V01
the  
attention  V02
to  
detail  <ARG1
and  
the  
quality  
of  
the  
work  V01
taught  V01
at  
TomiPilates  <ARGM-LOC
that  >R-ARG0
sets  V02
this  
studio  <ARG1
apart  
from  
the  
others  
.  

The  
teachers  >>>ARG1
are  V01
highly  
trained  <ARG2
and  
are  V01
expert  V01
at  
handling  V01
all  
types  <ARG1
of  
clients  
.  

I  >ARG0
phoned  V01
this  
company  <ARG1
for  
advice  <ARGM-PRP
on  
our  
office  
refurb  
and  
although  
we  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
use  V01
them  <ARG1
in  
the  
end  V01
(  
as  
our  
building  
contractor  >ARG0
carried  V03
out  
the  
electrical  >ARG1
work  V01
)  
,  
they  >ARG0
provided  V01
me  <ARG2
with  
plenty  <ARG1
of  
useful  
information  
over  
an  
hour  >ARGM-TMP
phone  >ARGM-MNR
call  V02
and  
subsequently  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG0
are  V03
now  >ARGM-TMP
using  V01
PJC  <ARG1
as  
our  
electrical  >ARG1
maintenance  V01
contractor  <<ARG2
.  

Thoroughly  
recommended  

They  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
go  V06
above  <ARG2
and  
beyond  
!  

For  
example  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
forgot  V01
to  
feed  V01
my  
cat  <ARG2
,  
and  
they  >>>ARG0
went  V02
out  
of  
their  >ARG0
way  V01
to  
take  VLV
care  V03
of  
him  <ARG1
.  

Additionally  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
there  
was  V02
confusion  V01
(  
my  >ARG1
fault  V01
)  
,  
they  >ARG0
left  V02
me  <ARG2
flowers  <ARG1
along  
with  
a  
personalized  V01
gift  <ARG1
.  

They  >>>ARG1
have  V01
been  V01
100  
%  >ARGM-EXT
reliable  V02
and  
professional  
.  

Definitely  >ARGM-ADV
recommend  V01

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
understand  V01
that

not

You  >ARG0

SO  
MUCH  <ARG1

yet  
you  >ARG0
use  V01
the  
same

over  
again  
.  

The  
coffee  >>ARG0
taste  V02
BURNT  <ARG2

very  >ARGM-EXT
bitter  V01
.  

No

I  >ARG0
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
go  V02
into  
this  
store  <ARG4
just  
for  
something  >ARG1
to  
do  V02
on  
a  
sunday  
afternoon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
love  V01
the  
people  <ARG1
,  
the  
product  
and  
the  
service  V02
!  

Nothing  >ARG1
compares  V01
to  
a  
home  
made  
product  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
stands  V03
the  
test  V01
of  
time  <ARG0
.  
-  

The  
Brick  >ARG0
,  
Ikea  
,

Leon

have  V03
their

this  
will  >ARGM-MOD
truly  >ARGM-ADV
be  V01
around  <ARG2
forever  <ARGM-TMP

The  
internet  >>ARG1
here  
is  V01
terrible  V01
.  

Like  
the  
previous  
poster  >ARG0
said  V01
,  
the  
com  
lines  >>ARG1
are  V03
split  V01
between  
the  
entire

That  >>ARG1
's  V01
3

worse  V07
than  
Qwest

's  
lowest

offering  V01
!  

The  
outward  >ARGM-ADJ
appearance  V01
makes  V02
you  >ARG0
think  V01
this  
place  >>ARG1
is  V01
nice  V01
,  
but  
everything  >>>ARG1
inside  
is  V01
cheap  V02

they  >ARG0
save  V02

I  >ARG0

even  
if  
you  >ARG0

quite  
the  
mixed

of  
comedians  
!  

Extensive  
drink  
list  
and  
daily  
specials  
but  
wish  V01
they  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
bit  
more  <ARG1
on  
their  
food  
menu  <ARGM-LOC
,  
although  
popcorn  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
touch  V01
!  

(  
other  
items  
:  
chicken  
fingers  
,  
wings  
,  
asian  
pizza  
,  
and  
yam  
and  
regular

)  

Their  
food  >>ARG0
and  
sweets  
are  V01
awesome  V01
.  

But  >>>ARGM-DIS
service  V02
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
poor  V02
.  

Attitude  
of  
staff  
very  
bad  
.  

Never  >ARGM-NEG
gives  V01
a  
receipt  <ARG1
.  

Sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
even  >ARGM-ADV
gives  V01
wrong  
dish  <ARG1
.  

So  
confused  
at  
the  
payment  
area  
.  

Line  
up  >>ARG1
is  V01
so  >ARGM-EXT
stupid  V01
.  

Even  
if

up

To  
make  VLV

you  >>ARG0

the

worked  V01
with

was  V01
pretty  >ARGM-EXT

important

always  >>ARGM-TMP
look  V02
great  V01
!  

Tried  V01
Crust  <ARG1
on  
Broad  
on  
3  
occasions  V02
.  

Twice  
for  
dinner  
and  
once  
for  
lunch  
Absolutely  
rude  >ARGM-MNR
service  V02
every  
time  
!  

The  
staff  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
answer  V01
the  
phone  <ARG1
for  
take  
out  
.  

Tonight  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>>ARG0
called  V02
several  
times  <ARGM-TMP
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
answer  V01
(  
Btwn  
5:30  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
6  
pm  
)  
and  
finally  >ARGM-TMP
drove  V01
there  <ARGM-GOL
to  
place  V01
my  >ARG0
order  V02
in  
person  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

There  
was  V02
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
customer  >>ARG1
to  
be  V03
found  V01
.  

we  >>>ARG0
purchased  V01
a  
new  
home  <ARG1
but  
was  V01
unable  V01
to  
sell  V01
our  
old  
house  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
contacted  V01
this  
property  >ARG1
management  V01
company  <<ARG1
and  
they  >>ARG0
have  V01
helped  V01
us  >>ARG0
quickly  >ARGM-MNR
rent  V04
out  
our  
house  <ARG1
and  
keep  V02
it  >ARG1
maintained  V01
.  

Since  
then  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>>ARG0
have  V01
decided  V01
to  
have  V04
them  >ARG0
manage  V01
our  
other  
investment  
properties  <ARG1
as  <ARGM-DIS
well  
as  
we  >>>ARG0
getting  V03
older  V01
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
no  
longer  >ARGM-NEG
perform  V01
all  
the  
inquires  <ARG1
.  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
help  V01
!  

We  >>>ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
got  V04
our  
sunroom  >ARG1
built  V01
by  
Patio  
World  <ARG0
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
that  
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
happy  V01
with  
the  
whole  
thing  <ARG0
.  

From  
the  
amount  >ARG1
of  
time  
spent  V02
with  
us  <ARGM-COM
to  
explain  V01
things  <ARG1
during  
the  
initial  >ARGM-TMP
quote  V01
,  
to  
the  
communication  V01
through  
the  
approval  >ARG1
process  V02
to  
the  
actual  
workmanship  
of  
the  
build  V01
itself  <ARGM-REC
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V03
nothing  >ARG1
bad  
to  
say  V01
.  

Very  
glad  
that  
we  >ARG0
went  V02
with  
them  <ARGM-COM
.  

No  >ARGM-NEG
Customer  >ARG2
Service  V02

Employees  >>>ARG0
seemed  V01
to  
be  V03
having  V03
a  
good  
time  <ARG1
chatting  V01
and  
laughing  V01
with  
each  
other  <ARGM-COM
,  
while  
myself  >>ARG1
and  
other  
customers  
were  V03
completely  >ARGM-EXT
ignored  V01
.  

Another  
person  >>>ARG0
in  
the  
store  
stood  V01
there  <ARG2
with  
an  
item  <ARGM-ADV
and  
repeatedly  >ARGM-ADV
tried  V01
to  
get  V01
a  
sales  
person  >ARG0
s  
attention  V02
.  

It  
was  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
until  
he  >>ARG0
gave  V07
up  
and  
walked  V01
out  
the  
door  <ARG2
that  >ARGM-ADV
someone  >ARG0
asked  V01
Can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
help  V01
you  <ARG2
.  

do  V01
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
bring  V01
your  
car  <ARG1
here  <ARG2

I  >ARG0
got  V01
a  
coupon  <ARG1
from  
Pennysaver  <ARG2
for  
this  
station  <C-ARG1
.  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
they  >ARG0
accepted  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
during  
the  
test  V01
,  
they  >ARG0
did  V02
whatever  <ARG1
they  
can  
to  
get  V04
my  >ARG1
test  V01
failed  V01
.  

Then  >ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >ARG0
sold  V01
me  <ARG2
overpriced  
stuffs  <ARG1
,  
such  
as  
oil  
tank  
cap  
,  
so  
that  
my  
car  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
pass  V07
it  <ARG2
right  
away  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
ended  V03
up  
paying  V01
much  
more  <ARG1
.  

Are  V03
you  >ARG0
kidding  V01
me  <ARG1
?  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

Spongy  
and  
sweet  
bread  >ARG1
(  
microwaved  V01
?  
)  
,  
heartless  
salsa  
,  
tiny  
dogs  
...  

You  >ARG0
order  V02
at  
the  
counter  <ARGM-LOC
and  
there  
is  V02
a  
space  <ARG1
for  
tip  V02
on  
your  
credit  
card  
receipt  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
dude  >>>ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
grills  V01
the  
retarded  
dogs  <ARG1
is  V01
rude  V01
.  

If  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
best  >>>ARGM-ADV
that  >>ARG1
Tucson  >ARG0
has  V03
to  
offer  V01
,  
I  >ARG1
am  V01
out  
ta  
here  <ARG2
...  

I  >>ARG0
called  V02
on  
a  
Friday  <ARGM-TMP
at  
12:30  <ARGM-TMP
complaining  V01
of  
a  
severe  
toothache  <ARG1
.  

Dr.  >ARG0
Obina  
told  V01
me  <ARG2
that  
his  
office  >ARG1
closed  V01
at  
noon  <ARGM-TMP
and  
that  
I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
call  V02
him  <ARG1
on  
Monday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>>ARG0
had  V01
been  V01
a  
patient  <ARG2
of  
Dr.  
Olbina  
for  
9  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
had  V01
spent  V01
thousands  <ARG3
of  
dollars  
on  
crowns  <ARG3
etc  
.  

There  
are  V02
plenty  <ARG1
of  
good  
dentists  
in  
Fernandina  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
to  
Amelia  
Gentle  
Dentistry  <ARG4
.  

Good  
location  

For  
a  
hotel  >ARGM-CAU
like  
this  
you  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
expect  V01
some  
form  <ARG1
of  
free  
internet  
.  

What  >>ARG1
you  >>>ARG0
get  V01
is  V01
a  
$  >ARG1
13  
/  
day  
charge  V01
to  
access  V01
the  
internet  <ARG1
through  
a  
slow  
512  
/  
512  
kb  >ARG1
/  
s  
that  >R-ARG1
you  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
use  V01
to  
check  V01
email  V01
etc  
(  
Read  V01
:  
No  >ARGM-NEG
downloading  V01
)  
.  

Other  >ARGM-ADV
than  
that  
the  
hotel  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
a  
good  
location  <ARG2
and  
the  
breakfast  >>ARG1
is  V01
great  V01

Make  V02
You  >ARG0
Feel  V01
Like  
a  
Number  <ARG1

Stay  V01
away  <ARG3
from  
Kids  
First  
West  
Chester  
.  

You  >ARG0
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
a  
human  <ARG1
on  
the  
phone  <ARGM-MNR
.  

It  
's  V01
impossible  V01
to  
get  VLV
an  
appointment  V02
.  

If  
you  >>>ARG1
get  V03
caught  V03
in  
traffic  <ARG2
and  
are  V01
a  
couple  
minutes  >ARGM-TMP
late  V02
they  >ARG0
make  V02
you  >ARG0
re-schedule  V01
...  
for  
6  
weeks  <ARG3
later  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
worst  >ARGM-ADV
of  
all  
your  
child  >ARG0
feels  V01
like  
a  
number  <ARG1
not  
a  
patient  
.  

Go  V02
somewhere  <ARG4
else  
.

Caffe  
Bella  
Italia  <ARGM-LOC
and  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
wonderful  >ARGM-ADJ

.  

From  
the  
delectable  
Antipasto  
Misto  
to  
the  
Spaghetti  
alla  
Barese  
and  
the  
Parmigiana  
and  
ending  V01
with  
gelato  <ARG2

all  >ARG1
was  V01

Too  
bad

were  V01
out

suffering  V01
from  
back  
pain  <ARG1
for  
over  
12  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
have  V01
been  V01
to  
numerous  
specialists  <ARG2
,  
physios  
,  
osteos  
and  
chiros  
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
help  V01
.  

It  
took  V10
the  
Vigor  
team  <ARG2
only  
4  >ARGM-ADV
visits  V01
to  
get  V04
me  >>ARG1
feeling  V01
normal  V02
!  

And  >>>ARGM-DIS

2  
months  
after  
my  >ARG0
last  >ARGM-TMP
appointment  V02
I  >>ARG1
am  V01
better  V05
than  
ever  <ARGM-CXN
.  

Thanks  V01
guys  <ARGM-DIS

They  >>>ARG0
must  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
read  V01
these  
reviews  V01
and  
improved  V01
!  

My  
husband  >ARG1
and  
I  
happened  V02
in  <ARGM-PRD
on  
a  
whim  <ARGM-CAU
.  

We  >ARG1
sat  V01
in  
the  
front  
dining  
area  <ARG2
,  
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
cozy  <ARG2
and  
pleasant  V02
.  

Our  
server  >>ARG0
was  V01
quite  >ARGM-EXT
attentive  V02
and  
the  
food  >>ARG1
was  V01
fantastic  V02
.  

My  
husband  >>ARG1
has  V01
been  V01
a  
professional  
chef  <ARG2
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
he  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
good  
judge  <ARG2
of  
quality  
food  
.  

This  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
flavorful  
,  
enjoyable  
meal  <ARG2
for  
both  
of  
us  
.  

Rude

went  V02

my  
dog  >ARG1
groomed  V01
came  V01
home  <ARG4
to  
an  
uneven  
dog  <ARGM-GOL
then  >ARGM-TMP
took  V01
him  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-PRD
to  
get  V03
evened  V02
up  <ARGM-PRD
what  
a  
mistake  V02
!  

she  >>>ARG0
did  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
let  V01
me  >ARG0
finish  V01
a  
sentence  V02
without  
insulting  V01
me  <ARG1
and  
telling  V01
me  <ARG2
how  >>ARGM-MNR
i  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
said  V01
it  <ARG1
!  

i  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
back  <ARG4
!  

she  >>ARG0
needs  V01
to  
develop  V02
a  
personality  <ARG1
!  

brought  V01
dog  <ARG1
home  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
s  V01
all  
choppy  <ARG2
now  <ARGM-TMP
!  

It  
's  V01
helpful  V04
to  
know  V01
a  
quite  
a  
bit  <ARG1
about  
bull  >ARG1
fighting  V01
.  

If  
you  >>>ARG0
watch  V01
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
fights  V01
(  
youtube  <<ARGM-MNR
)  
and  
research  V01
some  <ARG1
of  
the  
history  
(  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting  <ARGM-MNR
)  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
find  V01
yourself  >ARG0
enjoying  V01
it  <ARG1
a  
lot  
more  <ARGM-EXT
!  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
after  
seeing  V01
a  
handful  <ARG1
of  
bullfights  
,  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
that  
they  >>ARG1
're  V01
a  
lot  
more  >ARGM-EXT
enjoyable  V02
if  
you  >ARG1
're  V01
smashed  <ARG2
(  
BAC  
>=  
.15  
)  
.  

All  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
is  V01
that  
I  >>ARG1
am  V01
glad  V02
I  >ARG0
went  V02
in  <ARGM-DIR
!  

The  
nurses  >>ARG1
are  V01
sweet  V03
as  
pie  <ARGM-EXT
and  
the  
doctor  >>ARG1
is  V01
wonderful  V03
.  

This  
place  >ARG1
is  V01
about  
healing  V01
,  
not  
making  V05
a  
buck  <ARG1
.  

The  
followup  >ARGM-ADJ
visit  V01
is  V01
FREE  V03
!!  

After  
going  V02
to  
the  
hospital  <ARG4
and  
paying  V01
ER  >ARG1
prices  V01
...  
there  
is  V02
no  
way  V01
I  >ARG1
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
back  
here  <ARG2
!!  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
back  <ARG2
and  
telling  V01
EVERYONE  <ARG2
about  
this  
clinic  <ARG1
.  

THANK  V01
YOU  <ARG1
!!  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
like  V01
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
he  >>>ARG0
was  V01
able  V01
to  
do  VLV
the  
specific  
type  >>ARG1
of  
repair  V01
I  >ARG0
wanted  V01
(  
a  
reball  
)  
and  
give  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
longest  
warranty  <ARG1
and  
even  >ARGM-ADJ
a  
lower  >ARGM-ADJ
price  V01
.  

Someone  >>>ARG0
else  
I  >ARG0
found  V01
that  >>>R-ARG0
said  V01
they  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
it  <ARG1
but  
wanted  V01
to  
charge  V01
me  <ARG2
more  <ARG1
and  
give  V01
me  <ARG2
less  
warranty  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
no  
brainer  <ARG2
really  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
choose  V01
Console  
Pros  <ARG1

I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
happy  V01
I  
did  V01

This

is  V01
bad  V07
.  

It  >>>ARG1
's  V01
dark  V02
,  
dingy  
&  
dirty  V02
.  

The  
salads  >ARG1
are  V01
limp  <ARG2
and  
the  
rest  >>ARG1
of  
the  
food  
is  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
any  >ARGM-EXT
better  V02
(  
ok  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
nachos  >>ARG1
are  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
too  >ARGM-EXT
bad  V07
!  
)  

This  
place  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V01
something  <ARG2
sometime  <ARGM-TMP

RIP  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
original  
Ham  
's  
restaurant  >ARG1
,  
expanded  V01
into  
a  
regional  
chain  <ARG4
in  
the  
late  
80's  <ARGM-TMP
--  
but  
this  
one  >ARG1
is  V01
no  
more  <ARG2
.  

Victim  
of  
hard  
times  
and  
I  >ARG0
suspect  V01
failing  >ARGM-PRD
corporate  >ARGM-ADJ
management  V01
.  

According  
to  
news  >ARG0
accounts  V01
,  
the  
company  >>ARG0
is  V03
struggling  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
many  
fond  
memories  <ARG1
of  
my  
college  
evenings  
there  
long  
ago  
.  

So  
long  >>ARGM-DIS
Ham  
s  
...  
you  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
missed  V01
.  

We  >>ARG1
are  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
pleased  V01
with  
the  
services  V02
of  
First  
Glass  
Window  <ARG1
.  

Our  
window  
panes  >>ARG1
were  V01
so  >ARGM-CXN
dirty  V02
that  
they  >ARG0
needed  V01
a  
specialist  >>ARG0
to  
come  V01
and  
clean  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
called  V02
few  
companies  <ARG1
before  
we  >>ARG0
decide  V01
to  
hire  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
came  V01
on  
time  <ARGM-TMP
and  
completed  V01
their  >ARG0
work  V01
quickly  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

We  >>ARG1
were  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
happy  V01
how  
clean  >ARG1
looked  V02
our  
windows  <ARG0
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
some  
problems  <ARG1
with  
your  
windows  
,  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
call  V02
them  <ARG1
.  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
help  V01
even  
near  
closing  
time  
!  

I  >>ARG0
came  V01
in  
to  
town  <ARG4
for  
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
and  
forgot  V01
my  
trainers  <ARG1
!  

Oh  
no  
!!  

I  >ARG1
came  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
30  
min  
before  
close  V01
and  
the  
staff  >>ARG0
was  V01
super  >ARGM-EXT
helpful  V04
.  

They  >>ARG0
spent  V02
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
time  
with  
me  <ARGM-COM
and  
got  V04
me  <ARG1
into  
a  
great  
pair  <ARG1
of  
shoes  
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
they  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
even  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V01
better  V02
than  
the  
pair  >>>ARG1
I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
using  V01
this  
past  
year  <ARGM-TMP
!  

Thanks  V01
Run  
on  <ARGM-DIS
!  

Great  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
perfect  
place  >ARGM-LOC
to  
get  V04
your  
hair  >ARG1
done  V02
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
gone  V02
there  <ARG4
time  <ARGM-TMP
and  
time  
again  
whenever  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
get  V04
my  
hair  >ARG1
done  V02
or  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
want  V01
a  
haircut  <ARG1
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
get  V04
my  
hair  >ARG1
done  V02
there  <ARGM-LOC
,  
they  >ARG0
use  V01
enough  
hairstyling  
products  <ARG1
while  
it  >>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
ruin  V01
your  
hair  <ARG1
.  

The  
service  V02
is  V01
great  V01
and  
during  
weekends  >ARGM-TMP
it  >>>ARG1
tends  V02
to  
get  V03
busy  V01
,  
but  
the  
wait  >>ARG1
is  V01
worthwhile  V01
.  

Highly  >ARGM-EXT
Recommend  V01

I  >>>ARG1
have  V01
worked  V01
with  
Shannon  <ARG3
as  
my  
massage  
therapist  
and  
intuitive  
bodyworker  
for  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
have  V01
never  >>ARGM-NEG
been  V03
disappointed  V01
.  

No  
matter  >>>ARGM-ADV
what  
state  >ARG2
I  >ARG1
am  V01
in  <C-ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
arrive  V01
,  
I  >>>ARG1
always  >ARGM-TMP
leave  V11
feeling  V01
better  V05
.  

She  >>ARG0
has  V01
not  
only  
helped  V01
me  <ARG2
through  
some  
challenging  >>ARGM-ADJ
computer  >ARG1
-  
work  V01
and  
sports  
related  >ARG2
injuries  V01
,  
she  >>ARG1
was  V01
wonderful  V03
to  
work  V01
with  <ARG3
throughout  
my  
pregnancy  <ARGM-TMP
and  
beyond  
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
her  <ARG1
.  

Best  
Store  
In  
Boothbay  
Harbor  

What  
a  
fantastic  
store  
,  
I  >ARG0
love  V01
this  
place  <ARG1
.  

Not  
the  
same  
old  
stuff  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
all  
the  
other  
stores  >ARG0
have  V03
.  

Their  
items  >>ARG1
are  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
unique  V01
,  
great  
quality  
,  
great  >ARGM-MNR
prices  V01
.  

They  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
have  V03
the  
best  
tea  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had  V03
,  
not  
at  
all  
like  
the  
junk  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
get  V01
at  
the  
grocery  
stores  <ARGM-LOC
,  
I  >ARG0
stock  V02
up  
when  
ever  
there  <ARGM-TMP
because  
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
closed  V01
in  
the  
winter  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
BEST  

Dr.  >>ARG1
Aster  
and  
her  
team  
have  V01
been  V01
a  
strong  
advocate  <ARG2
in  
the  
health  
of  
both  
my  
daughters  
.  

Dr.  >ARG1
Aster  
is  V01
very  
kind  <ARG2
an  
gentle  
with  
the  
children  
,  
but  
also  
positive  
and  
to  
the  
point  
with  
the  
parents  
.  

She  >ARG1
is  V01
and  
excellent  
doctor  >ARG1
to  
have  V03
on  
one  
's  
team  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Even  
though  
I  >ARG0
live  V01
pretty  
far  <ARGM-LOC
from  
her  
office  
I  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
make  VLV
the  
trip  V03
so  
my  
daughters  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
the  
BEST  <ARG1
!  

My  
wife  >>>ARG0
and  
I  
avoided  V01
doing  VLV
some  
fairly  
simple  >ARGM-ADV
electrical  >ARG1
re-wiring  V01
in  
our  
home  <ARGM-LOC
for  
several  
years  <ARGM-TMP
due  
to  
overall  >ARGM-ADJ
hassle  V02
and  
cost  
involved  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
finally  >ARGM-TMP
called  V02
Matt  <ARG1
from  
Bonafide  
and  
he  >ARG0
made  V02
the  
project  >>ARG1
both  
easy  V05
for  
us  <ARGM-GOL
and  
reasonable  V02
.  

He  >ARG1
was  V01
prompt  <ARG2
,  
knowledgable  
,  
friendly  
,  
clean  
and  
just  
an  
overall  
great  
guy  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
obviously  >ARGM-ADV
cares  V01
about  
his  
business  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
reccommend  V01
his  >ARG0
services  V01
however  <<ARGM-ADV
/  
whenever  
possible  
!  

Real

horror

their  
printers  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
tell  V01
them  <ARG2
:  
why  >ARGM-CAU
not  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADV
go  V02
with  
these  
guys  <ARGM-COM
?  

Richard  >ARG1
Joule

the

finish  V02

They  >>ARG0
set  V07
out  
to  
exceed  V01
your  >ARG0

Already  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
considering  V02
future

and  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD

you  <ARG1
that  
for  
my  >ARG0

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD

have  V01
been  V01
here  <ARG2
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
and  
all  
3  
times  >>>ARGM-TMP
it  >>>ARG1
has  V01
been  V01
bad  V07
!  

They  >>ARG0
have  V01
messed  V02
up  
my  >ARG0
order  V02
and  
....  
The  
food  >>ARG1
was  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG
good  V02
!  

I  >ARG0
had  V03
sonic  <ARG1
in

the  
way  V01
they  >ARG0
looked  V02
,  
very  
wavy  
,  
uneven  
edges  
,  
and  
with  
the  
exception  V01
of  
1  <ARG1
,  
there  
is  V02
a  
dip  <ARG1
in  
the  
center  
of  
each

I  >ARG0

no  
expert  <ARG2
on  
asian  
food  
in  
fact  
not  
even  
a  
lover  
of  
Vietnamese  
food

real  
things  <ARG1
here  
at  
A  
Dong

Cold  >ARG1

In

my  >ARG0

was  V03
dealing  V01

I  >ARG0

While

Used  V01

was  V03
immediately  >ARGM-TMP
impressed  V01

Over-rated

This

is  V01
over-rated  <ARG2
.  

It  >>ARG1
is  V01
hard  V02
to  
find  V01
...  
and  
the  
mexican  
food  >>ARG1
is  V01
bland  <ARG2
,  
almost  >ARGM-ADV
equivalent  V01
to  
eating  V01
out  
of  
a

.  

The  
service  V02
is  V01
poor  V02

The  
Chili

Good  
Pizza

good  >ARGM-MNR
price  V01

I  >>>ARG0
just  >>>ARGM-TMP

this  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
first  
one  <ARG2

The  
pizza  >>ARG1

only  
bad  
one  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0

just  >ARGM-ADV
needed  V01
to  
be  V03
cooked  V01
a  
little  
more  <ARGM-EXT
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
still  >ARGM-TMP
good  V02
.  

Their  
BBQ  
chicken  
pizza  >ARG1
is  V01
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
better  
ones  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had  V03

is  V01
probably  <ARGM-ADV
a  
question  V03
of  
practice  <ARG1
.  

A  
wonderful  
place  
,  
if  
you  >ARG0

Give  V01
yourself  <ARG2
the  
gift  <ARG1

it  >ARG1
fits  V01
you  <ARG2

Went  V02

The

Good

on  
a  
Sunday  
Night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
beers  >>ARG1
were  V01
good  V02
,  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
choice  V01
of  
beers  <ARG2
as  
well  
,  
and  
as  
usual  >>ARGM-ADV
the

the

upstairs  
is  V01
a

addition  V02
to  
the

downstairs  
.  

Filled  V02
up  
on  
too  
much  
beer  <ARG2
and  
hence  >ARGM-ADV
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
comment  V01
on  
the  
food  <ARG3
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
the

had  V03
standard  
stuff  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
one  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
at  
a

If

I  >ARG1
moved  V01

and  
it  >>ARG1

been  V01
a  
refreshing  V01

.  

I  >>ARG0
used  V03
to  
live  V01
at  
Meadowrun  <ARGM-LOC

that  >ARG1

The

is  V01
actually  >ARGM-ADV
very  >ARGM-EXT

so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
a  
bit  >ARGM-EXT

any

Plus  >ARGM-DIS
she  >ARG0

the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
prices  V01
locally  <ARGM-LOC
and  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
customer  >ARG2
service  V02

One  
guy  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
little  
surley  <ARG2
,  
but  
who  >ARG0
gives  V16
a  
crap  <ARG1
as  
long  <ARGM-ADV
as  
your  
car  >ARG1
's  
work  V01
is  V01
outstanding  <ARG2
.  

AND  
they  >>>ARG0
're  V01
usually  >ARGM-TMP
able  V01
to  
help  V01
you  <ARG2
as  
a  
walk  
-  
in  <ARGM-PRD
,  
and  
they  >>ARG1
're  V01
fast  V02
.  

Overall  
-  
good  
stuff  
.  

Another  
great  
business  >ARG0
bites  V01
the  
dust  <ARG1
!  

The  
best  
cakes  
EVER  
!  

A  
bit  
pricey  
,  
so  >>ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
very  
often  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
always  <ARGM-TMP
a  
treat  <ARG2
when  
I  
did  V01
.  

The  
prices  V01
were  V01
worth  V01
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
got  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
assuming  V02
they  >ARG1
are  V01
completely  <ARGM-EXT
out  
of  
business  <ARG2
since  
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
find  V01
any  
contact  
information  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
hoping  V01
the  
bakers  >>>ARG0
continue  V01
to  
do  VLV
their  >ARGM-GOL
baking  V01
out  
of  
another  
place  <ARGM-LOC
,  
because  
it  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
shame  V02
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
have  V03
these  
cakes  <ARG1
any  
longer  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Super  
nice  
people  
,  
really  
good  
food  

What  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
love  V01
most  <ARGM-EXT
about  
this  
place  <ARGM-ADV
,  
other  <ARGM-ADV
than  
the  
food  
,  
is  V01
that  
eating  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
makes  V02
you  >ARG0
feel  V01
like  
you  >ARG1
're  V01
in  
a  
small  
town  <ARG2
rather  
than  
Baltimore  
.  

The  
owners  >>ARG1
are  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
nice  V01
,  
they  >ARG0
serve  V02
good  
food  <ARG1
at  
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
price  V01
,  
and  
the  
option  >>>ARG1
to  
eat  V01
outside  <ARGM-LOC
on  
the  
deck  <ARGM-LOC
(  
esp  
on  
the  
weekend  >>>ARGM-TMP
whether  
there  
is  V02
hardly  <ARGM-ADV
any  
traffic  <ARG1
)  
is  V01
great  V01
.  

One  
of  
my  
top  
5  
places  >ARGM-LOC
to  
eat  V01
in  
Baltimore  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Overpriced  

This  
place  >>ARG1
is  V01
identical  V01
to  
the  
Youngstown  
Sports  
Grille  <ARG2
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
imagine  V01
they  >>>ARG1
are  V03
owned  V01
/  
operated  V01
by  
the  
same  
people  <ARG0
.  

The  
food  >ARG1
is  V01
mediocre  <ARG2
at  
best  <ARGM-ADV
,  
and  
largely  
overpriced  
given  
the  
portion  
size  
and  
quality  
.  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
get  V04
me  >ARG0
started  V01
on  
how  
expensive  >ARG2
it  
is  V01
to  
drink  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
ate  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
since  
they  >ARG1
first  >ARGM-TMP
opened  V01
,  
and  
the  
service  V02
has  V01
been  V01
poor  V02
each  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
staff  >ARG1
always  >ARGM-TMP
comes  V15
across  
as  
somewhat  
rude  <ARG3
and  
slow  
.

I  >>ARG0

I  >ARG0
had  V03
the

which  >>R-ARG1
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
good  V02
but  
the  
steaks  >>ARG0
looked  V02
amazing  V01
and  
if  
I  >ARG1
am  V01
in

again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
order  V02
a

Very

interviewed  V01
me  <ARG1

gave  V01
me  <ARG2
tests  V01
in  
the

I  >ARG0
included  V01

I  >ARG0
kept  V01
for  
several

Re-interviewed  V01

I  >ARG1
'm  V01
really  
thankful  <ARG2
for  
the  
folks  
at  
HR

They  >>>ARG1
are  V01
dependable  <ARG2
,  
have  VLV
great  >ARGM-ADJ
connections  V01
in  
the  
community  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
are  V01
a  
great  
resource  <ARG2
for  
finding  V01
a  
job  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
them  <ARG1
to  
all  <ARG2
of  
my  
friends  
!!!!  
!  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
-  
consider  V02
checking  V05
out  
their  
puppies  <ARG1
before  
buying  V01
from  
a  
breeder  <ARG2
!  

I  >ARG0
adopted  V01
a  
3.5  
month  
old  
yellow  
lab  <ARG1
last  
winter  <ARGM-TMP
from  
the  
Dumb  
Friends  
League  <ARGM-DIR
.  

The  
staff  >>>ARG0
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful  V04
in  
finding  V01
the  
right  
dog  <ARG1
for  
me  
and  
the  
care  V03
my  
pup  >ARG0
received  V01
was  V01
outstanding  <ARG2
.  

If  
you  >ARG1
are  V01
on  
the  
lookout  >>ARGM-ADV
for  
a  
pure  
breed  
pup  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
forget  V01
to  
check  V05
out  
the  
shelters  <ARG1
!  

My  
pup  >>>ARG1
has  V03
a  
wonderful  
temperment  <ARG1
and  
has  V01
been  V01
a  
wonderful  >ARGM-ADJ
addition  V02
to  
my  
family  <ARG2
!  

Food  
good  
,  
service  V02
poor  

No  
silverware  
,  
asked  V02
for  
a  
spoon  <ARG1
for  
my  
son  
s  
mac  
and  
cheese  
ended  V03
up  
having  V02
to  
use  V01
my  
tea  
spoon  <ARG1
.  

Asked  V02
for  
bar  
-  
b  
-  
que  
sauce  <ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
got  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

Never  >ARGM-NEG
checked  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
with  
us  <ARG1
once  
we  >ARG0
got  V01
our  
food  <ARG1
.  

Had  V02
to  
go  V02
the  
the  
bus  
boy  
s  
station  <ARG4
ourselves  <ARGM-REC
to  
get  V01
napkins  <ARG1
.  

Only  
one  
server  
,  
too  
buys  
talking  V01
with  
others  <ARG2
I  >ARG0
guess  V01
.  

Food  >>ARG1
was  V01
good  V02
,  
but  
service  V02
means  V01
a  
lot  <ARG2
to  
me  <ARG3
.  

Dr.  >ARGM-DIS
Chao  
you  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
best  
dentist  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had  V03
.  

You  >>>ARG0
are  V01
knowledgeable  V01
,  
professional  
,  
gentel  
and  
kind  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
wish  V01
I  >ARG0
had  V03
you  <ARG1
as  
my  
dentist  <ARGM-PRD
early  
on  <ARGM-TMP
in  
my  
life  
-  
maybe  >>>ARGM-ADV
my  
teeth  >>>ARG1
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V01
a  
lot  >ARGM-CXN
better  V02
then  
they  >ARG1
are  V01
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
However  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG1
am  V01
glad  V02
you  >ARG1
are  V01
my  
dentist  <ARG2
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Even  
though  
you  >>ARG1
are  V01
expensive  V02
.  

Thank  V01
you  >>ARG0
for  
helping  V01
to  
preserve  V01
my  
teeth  <ARG1
.  

You  >ARG1
are  V01
meticulous  <ARG2
in  
your  >ARG0
work  V01
and  
it  >ARG1
shows  V01
in  
my  
smile  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Con  
Garage  

I  >ARG0
brought  V01
my  
car  <ARG1
in  <ARG3
for  
a  
simple  >ARGM-ADJ
emissions  >ARG1
test  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
guess  V01
they  >>>ARG0
figured  V04
me  <ARG1
for  
an  
easy  >ARGM-ADJ
mark  V02
,  
and  
tried  V01
to  
explain  V01
that  
my  
car  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
pass  V07
unless  
I  >ARG0
replaced  V01
a  
hose  <ARG1
.  

Ten  
minutes  
later  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
took  V01
my  
car  <ARG1
down  
the  
street  <ARGM-DIR
and  
it  >ARG1
passed  V07
the  
emissions  >ARG1
test  V01
with  
flying  
colors  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

If  
you  >ARG1
're  V01
a  
fan  >>>ARGM-ADV
of  
herpes  
,  
being  V03
ripped  V04
off  
,  
and  
child  
molesters  
,  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
garage  <ARG2
for  
you  
.  

If  
not  >ARGM-ADV
,  
go  V02
somewhere  <ARG4
else  
.  

Rude  >ARGM-MNR
service  V02

even  
though  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
tried  V01
hoa  
salon  <ARG1
but  
I  >ARG0
agree  V01
with  
other  
reviewers  <ARG2
that  
they  >>ARG0
are  V01
rude  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
called  V02
and  
asked  V01
about  
the  
price  V01
for  
hair  
updo  <ARG1
and  
the  
receptionist  >>>ARG0
or  
owner  
who  >R-ARG0
aswered  V01
the  
phone  <ARG1
refused  V01
to  
tell  V01
me  <ARG2
,  
or  
even  >ARGM-ADV
just  >ARGM-ADV
give  V01
me  <ARG2
an  
approximate  
price  
range  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
told  V01
us  >ARG0
to  
stop  V02
by  V_
the  
salon  <ARG1
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
tell  V01
us  <ARG2
the  
price  V01
.  

What  
kind  >>ARG2
of  
rude  >ARGM-MNR
service  V02
is  V01
that  <ARG1
?  

I  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
waste  V01
my  
time  <ARG1
with  
them  <ARG2
.  

Top

So  >ARGM-ADV
here  >ARGM-LOC
we  >ARG1
are  V01
in

Yes

Right  
near  
Chelan

Aka

And  >ARGM-DIS
this  
litttle  
gem  >ARG1
of  
a

table  
restaurant  
is  V01
a  
complete  >ARGM-EXT
and  
utterly  
wonderful  
surprise  V01
.  

A  
short  
but  
wide

menu  >ARG1
executed  V02
with  
innovative  >ARGM-ADJ
perfection  V01
in  
a  
cozy

the

served  V02
without  
pretense  <ARGM-MNR
,  
very  
reasonably

A  
great  
place  >ARG4
to  
go  V02
for  
dinner  <ARG1
after  
a  
day  <ARGM-TMP
of  
wine  >ARG1
tasting  V01
.  

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ

and  
Reasonable  >ARGM-ADJ

Boutique  
stores  >>>ARG1
dealing  V01
in  
children  
's  
clothing  <ARG2
/  
gifts  
are  V03
often  >ARGM-TMP
outrageously  >ARGM-MNR
priced  V01
(  
who  >>ARG0

to  
pay  V01
40  
dollars  <ARG1
for  
a  
newborn  
onesie  <ARG3
?  
)  

but  
I  >>>ARG0
was  V01
pleasantly  >ARGM-MNR
surprised  V01
to  
find  V01
that  
the  
Purple  
Goose  >ARG0
's  
prices  V01
are  V01
reasonable  V02
(  
for  
the  
SAME  
products  >>>ARGM-ADV
found  V01
at  
other  
area  
boutiques  <ARGM-LOC
,  
the  
prices  V01
were  V01
20  
-  
25  
%  >ARG3
cheaper  V02
)  
.  

The  
service  V02
was  V01
also  >>>ARGM-DIS
excellent  V02
-  
friendly  V01
,  
helpful  V04
and  
informative  
without  
being  V01
overbearing  V01
.  

Will  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
return  V01
.  

Consistantly  
poor  

A  
lack  V01
of  
organisation  V01
,  
coupled  V01
with  
the  
distain  <ARG2
for  
its  
customers  
,  
makes  V02
this  <ARG1
the  
worst  
rental  
agency  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
used  V01
.  

Chasing  V01
them  <ARG1
on  
issues  V02
from  
the  
day  <ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
moved  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
(  
many  
of  
them  
still  
unresolved  
as  
I  >ARG0
left  V11
)  
to  
all  
sorts  <<<ARGM-ADV

with

,  
after  
I  >ARG0
left  V11
.  
.  
.  
.  
as  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
as  
I  
could  
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
use  V01
them  <ARG1
,  
be  V01
vigilant  V01
and  
be  V01
ready  V02
to  
push  V01
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
go  V02
elsewhere  <ARG4

I  
would

It  >>ARG1
s  V03
been  V01
a  
few  
years  <ARG2
since  
I  >>ARG1
have  V01
been  V01
to  
Ipanema  <ARG2
.  

But  
my  
wife  >>ARG0
and  
I  
first  >ARGM-TMP
went  V02
there  <ARG4
thinking  V01
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
Brazilian  
food  <ARG2
(  
think  V01
lots  <ARG1
of  
meat  
)  
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
turned  V11
out  
to  
be  V01
a  
vegan  
restaurant  <ARG2
!  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
,  
this  >ARG1
was  V01
one  <ARG2
of  
my  
favorite  
places  >ARGM-LOC
to  
eat  V01
in  
all  <ARGM-LOC
of  
Richmond  
.  

Amazing  
!  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
let  V01
the  
nondescript  
building  
entrance  >ARG0
fool  V01
you  <ARG1
,  
these  >ARG1
are  V01
some  
creative  
and  
talented  
chefs  <ARG2
...  
two  
thumbs  
way  
,  
way  
up  
!  

Excellent  
food  
,  
fantastic  
wait  
staff  

I  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
threw  V03
a  
surprise  >ARGM-ADJ
birthday  >ARGM-ADJ
party  V01
for  
my  
wife  <<ARGM-GOL
at  
Fraiser  <<ARGM-LOC
's  
.  

We  >ARG0
had  V03
30  
guests  <ARG1
for  
the  
event  
,  
and  
everyone  >>ARG1
came  V01
away  <ARG3
from  
the  
evening  
impressed  V01
with  
not  
only  
the  
food  <ARG0
,  
but  
the  
outstanding  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02
as  
well  
.  

The  
management  V01
was  V01
easy  V05
to  
deal  V01
with  <ARG1
during  
the  
planning  
stages  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
the  
execution  V02
by  
the  
kitchen  
and  
wait  
staff  <ARG0
was  V01
flawless  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
Fraiser  <ARG1
's  
for  
anyone  >ARG0
planning  V01
a  
special  
event  <ARG1
for  
friends  
,  
family  
or  
business  
.  

FANTASTIC  
STORE  
!!!  

I  >ARG0
came  V26
upon  V_
this  
store  <ARG1
as  
the  
building  >ARG0
caught  V03
my  
eye  <ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
's  V03
located  V01
in  
the  
huge  
HONKA  
Log  
Homes  
building  <ARGM-LOC
,  
by  
Walmart  <ARGM-LOC
off  
of  
Evergreen  
Parkway  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
store  >>ARG1
was  V03
decorated  V01
with  
furnishings  <ARG2
&  
accessories  
.  

The  
friendly  
crew  >>>ARG0
working  V01
was  V01
great  V01
&  
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful  V04
.  

This  
store  >ARG1
is  V01
what  <ARG2
Colorado  >ARG1
is  V01
all  <ARG2
about  <ARG2
.  

Also  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
purchased  V01
some  
furniture  <ARG1
last  
year  <ARGM-TMP
and  
all  >>>ARG1
has  V01
been  V01
great  V01
!  

It's  >ARG0
durability  >>>ARG1
&  
look  V02
was  V01
perfect  V02
and  
I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
definitely  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V03
adding  V02
to  
my  >ARG0
collection  V01
soon  <<ARGM-TMP
!  

Lovely  
People  
,  
Great  
Hats  

I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
saddened  V01
to  
see  V01
the  
reviews  V01
that  >R-ARG0
claimed  V01
World  
Hats  
Mart  
has  VLV
poor  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02
.  

It  >ARG0
led  V03
me  >ARG0
to  
believe  V01
that  
the  
reviewers  >ARG0
simply  >ARGM-ADV
had  V03
difficulty  <ARG1
tolerating  
people  
with  
strongly  
-  
accented  
English  
.  

The  
husband  >>ARG1
and  
wife  
who  >R-ARG0
run  V01
this  
spot  <ARG1
are  V01
lovely  
people  <ARG2
.  

We  >>>ARG0
have  V01
had  VLV
many  >ARGM-ADJ
conversations  V01
with  
them  <ARG2
and  
they  >>>ARG1
have  V01
always  >>ARGM-TMP
been  V01
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
patient  V01
with  
me  <ARG2
as  
I  >ARG0
tried  V01
on  <ARGM-PRD
multiple  
hats  <ARG1
in  
search  V01
of  
the  
right  
costumes  <ARG2
for  
my  
magic  
act  
.  

I  >ARG0
recommend  V01
them  <ARG1
highly  <ARGM-EXT
!  

DO  V01
NT  >ARGM-NEG
ever  >ARGM-TMP
go  V02
there  <ARG4
,  
not  
even  
if  
your  
car  >ARG1
flips  V01
.  

Their  >ARG0
service  V02
sucks  V03
to  
start  V02
off  
with  <ARGM-ADV
,  
people  >>>ARG1
are  V01
cruel  V01
and  
ignorant  V02
.  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01
compeltly  
dissatisfied  <ARG2
with  
their  >ARG0
service  V01
and  
their  
products  
.  

They  >>ARG0
DO  V01
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
a  
return  
policy  <ARG1
and  
even  
if  
their  
product  >ARG0
SUCKS  V03
,  
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
take  V01
it  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
!  

DO  V01
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
EVER  >ARGM-TMP
GO  V02
HERE  <ARG4
.  

I  >ARG0
prefer  V01
Advanced  
auto  
parts  <ARG1
over  
this  
crappy  
place  <ARG2
with  
the  
meanest  
people  
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG0
THRIVE  V01
to  
get  V01
a  
customer  <ARG1
.  

DO  V01
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
here  <ARG4
..  
thank  V01
you  <ARG1

Horrible  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
growing  V01
my  
hair  <ARG1
out  <ARGM-ADV
for  
1  
year  <ARGM-TMP
plus  
and  
went  V02
in  <ARG4
to  
get  V04
1  
inch  >ARG1
taken  V07
off  
.  

I  >ARG0
walked  V01
out  <ARG2
with  
5  
inch  
long  
hair  <ARGM-MNR
on  
the  
top  
,  
2  
inch  
long  
hair  
on  
the  
sides  
,  
and  
1.5  
in  
the  
back  
.  

My  
hair  >ARG1
is  V01
uneven  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG0
looks  V02
rediculous  <ARG1
.  

This  
woman  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
working  V01
in  
supercuts  <ARG2
...  
if  
that  <ARGM-ADV
.  

This  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
terrible  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
and  
I  >ARG0
hope  V01
that  
no  
one  >ARG1
else  
goes  V12
through  
that  <ARG2
.  

Do  V02
your  
self  <ARG2
a  
favor  <ARG1
and  
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
to  
this  
establishment  <ARG4
.  

The  
worst  
Burger  
King  
restaurant  
!!!  

I  >ARG0
generally  >ARGM-ADV
like  V01
the  
BK  <ARG1
over  
the  
other  
fast  
serving  
restaurants  <ARGM-ADV
;  
however  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
regreted  V01
to  
visit  V01
this  
restaurant  <ARG1
at  
my  
town  
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
shame  V02
of  
my  
adorable  
town  <ARG0
,  
Branford  
.  

I  >>ARG0
ordered  V02
a  
kid  
meal  <ARG1
with  
a  
milk  
and  
found  V01
a  
bottle  >>ARG1
was  V03
half  >ARGM-EXT
opened  V01
already  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
asked  V02
them  >ARG0
to  
change  V01
it  <ARG1
but  
they  >ARG0
rudely  >ARGM-MNR
said  V01
that  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
okay  <ARG2
.  

Disgusting  
french  
fries  >ARG1
is  V01
very  
best  
menu  <ARG2
.  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
,  
or  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
learn  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
waste  V01
your  
money  <ARG1
.  

Disappointed  

The  
Bad  
:  
I  >>>ARG1
was  V01
at  
Napa  <ARG2
recently  <ARGM-TMP
and  
was  V01
unpleasantly  >ARGM-MNR
surprised  V01
at  
poor  
waiter  
svce  <ARG0
and  
subpar  
food  
.  

We  >ARG1
were  V01
a  
party  <ARG2
of  
4  
and  
none  >>ARG1
of  
us  
were  V01
particularly  >ARGM-ADV
pleased  V01
with  
our  
dishes  <ARG0
.  

Napa  >>>ARG0
is  V01
all  
about  
wine  <ARG2
but  
gives  VLV
very  
short  >ARGM-ADJ
descriptions  V01
of  
the  
wines  <ARG1
on  
their  
lists  
.  

I  >ARG0
found  V02
my  >ARG0
initial  >ARGM-TMP
selection  V01
satisfactory  V03
but  
the  
wine  >ARGM-ADJ
flight  V01
we  >ARG0
chose  V01
to  
be  V01
poorly  
composed  <ARG2
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
go  V02
ask  V01
lots  <ARG1
of  
questions  V01
about  
your  >ARG0
selections  V01
since  
your  >ARG0
expectations  V01
may  >ARGM-MOD
as  >ARGM-CXN
high  V02
as  
mine  >ARG1
were  V01
.  

Highly  >ARGM-EXT
Recommended  V01

We  >>>ARG0
walked  V01
in  <ARG2
to  
pick  V01
our  
little  
man  <ARG1
at  
10  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
to  
closing  
and  
heard  V01
laughter  <ARG1
from  
kids  <ARG2
and  
the  
staff  
.  

The  
facilities  >>ARG1
are  V01
more  V01
than  
adequate  <ARG2
and  
the  
staff  >ARG1
are  V01
just  <ARGM-ADV
phenomenal  <ARG2
.  

Their  
sense  V01
of  
humour  
and  
calmness  
when  >R-ARGM-TMP
dealing  V01
with  
the  
little  
ones  <ARG1
amazes  V01
me  <ARG1
every  
time  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
walk  V01
in  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG1
have  V01
since  >ARGM-TMP
moved  V01
slightly  
further  <ARG2
away  
from  
the  
centre  
but  
it  >>ARG1
's  V01
worth  V02
the  
extra  >ARGM-ADJ
travel  V01
,  
as  
the  
care  V03
provided  V01
exceeds  V01
our  >ARG0
expectations  V01
...  
especially  
after  
a  
few  >ARGM-ADJ
horrendous  >ARGM-ADJ
daycare  >ARG1
experiences  V01
elsewhere  <ARGM-LOC
.  

HORRIBLE  
!!!!  
!  

This  >>ARG1
has  V02
to  
be  V01
some  <ARG2
of  
the  
worst  
pizza  >>>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had  V03
the  
misfortune  <ARG1
of  
ordering  V02
.  

The  
crust  >ARG1
was  V01
lopsided  <ARG2
,  
thicker  
on  
one  
side  
than  
the  
other  
.  

It  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
had  V03
a  
hole  <ARG1
in  
one  
of  
the  
slices  
.  

There  
was  V02
minimal  
cheese  <ARG1
and  
sauce  
and  
it  >ARG0
completely  >ARGM-EXT
lacked  V01
flavor  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
New  
York  
pizza  <ARG1
and  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
it  <ARG2
!!  

This  >ARG1
was  V01
nothing  <ARG2
like  
New  
York  
style  
pizza  
!!!.  

I  >ARG0
love  V01
pizza  <ARG1
and  
this  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
complete  >ARGM-EXT
and  
utter  
disappointment  V01
!!  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
suggest  V01
this  
pizza  <ARG1
to  
anyone  <ARG2
!!!  

best  >ARGM-ADJ
quote  V01
ever  <ARGM-TMP
My  
gate  >>>ARG1
was  V01
stuck  V01
halfway  >ARGM-EXT
open  V01
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
called  V02
A  
CLASS  >ARGM-ADJ
Garage  
Doors  >ARG1
Dr  >ARG0
Services  V01
.  

They  >>>ARG0
came  V01
to  
my  
house  <ARG4
in  
no  
time  <ARGM-TMP
and  
started  V01
working  V01
on  
the  
gate  <ARG1
.  

They  >>>ARG0
were  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
friendly  V01
and  
were  V01
able  V01
to  
explain  V01
me  <ARG2
exactly  
what  >>ARG1
was  V01
wrong  V02
with  
it  <ARG2
.  

Once  
they  >ARG0
fixed  V02
it  <ARG1
they  >>>ARG0
answetred  V01
all  <ARG1
of  
my  >ARG0
questions  V01
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
hesitations  V01
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
gave  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
quote  V01
ever  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
that  
if  
my  
garage  
door  >>>ARG1
needs  V01
to  
be  V03
repaired  V01
,  
I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
calling  V02
A  
CLASS  
Garage  
Doors  <ARG1

You  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
happy  V01
at  
this  
store  <ARGM-LOC
!  

Allen  >>ARG1
Tire  
was  V03
recommended  V01
by  
friend  <ARG0
after  
my  >>ARG0
having  VLV
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
tire  >ARG1
experiences  V01
in  
Temecula  <ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
store  
manager  >>ARG0
,  
Jim  
Smith  
,  
made  VLV
an  
excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
tire  >ARG1
recommendation  V01
for  
my  
newly  
acquired  
Lexus  <ARG2
.  

Tires  >ARG1
were  V01
the  
right  >ARGM-ADJ
price  V01
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
the  
car  >ARG1
feels  V05
like  
it  >>ARG0
is  V03
riding  V01
on  
rails  <ARG1
around  
turns  V01
.  

The  
store  >>ARG1
is  V01
clean  <ARG2
,  
run  V01
very  
professionally  <ARGM-MNR
and  
a  
pleasure  >ARG2
to  
be  V01
in  <C-ARG2
.  

They  >ARG0
know  V01
their  
job  <ARG1
and  
you  >>>ARG0
do  V01
not  
have  V02
to  
watch  V01
them  <ARG1
to  
be  V01
sure  V01
everything  >>ARG1
is  V03
done  V02
right  V06
.  

Easiest  
Time  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had  V03
purchasing  V01
a  
car  <ARG1
!  

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02
,  
Not  
only  
did  
they  >ARG0
get  V01
the  
exact  
car  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
wanted  V01
win  
in  
48  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
but  
the  
sales  
man  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
took  V01
me  <ARG1
out  <ARG3
to  
lunch  
.  

Very  
kind  
and  
reliable  
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
this  
dealership  <ARG1
if  
you  >>>ARG0
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
like  V02
to  
hassle  V01
on  
price  V01
and  
receive  V01
friendly  >ARGM-MNR
service  V02
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
since  >ARGM-TMP
purchased  V01
two  
cars  <ARG1
from  
this  
dealership  <ARG2
,  
The  
first  
one  >ARG1
was  V01
from  
Phillip  <ARG2
and  
the  
second  >ARG1
was  V01
from  
Richard  <ARG2
.  

Both  >ARG1
were  V01
excellent  
sales  
men  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
put  V03
my  >ARG0
needs  V01
first  <<ARG2
.  

This  
place  >>ARG0
has  V01
done  V02
a  
great  
job  <ARG1
of  
taking  VLV
care  V03
of  
the  
usual  >ARGM-ADJ
maintenance  V01
on  
my  
hooptie  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
also  >>>ARGM-DIS
never  
have  V02
to  
wait  V01
long  <ARGM-TMP
for  
a  
yearly  
inspection  
sticker  <ARG2
...  
and  
never  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
the  
usual  >ARGM-ADJ
excuses  V02
other  
shops  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
gave  V01
me  <ARG2
...  
"  
the  
inspection  
guy  >ARG1
is  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
here  <ARG2
today  <ARGM-TMP
"  
....  
for  
example  
.  

Today  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
went  V02
into  
Kwik  <ARG4
Kar  
and  
there  
were  V02
two  
cars  <ARG1
in  
front  
of  
me  
for  
inspection  V01
...  
but  
I  >>ARG0
was  V01
still  <ARGM-ADV
out  
of  
there  <ARG2
pretty  
quick  <ARGM-TMP
...  
barely  >ARGM-ADV
had  V03
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
read  V01
a  
chapter  <ARG1
in  
my  
book  
.  

Extremely  
helpful  
and  
professional  

As  
first  
-  
time  
home  
buyers  >ARGM-PRD
,  
my  
husband  >ARG0
and  
I  
found  V02
Stephanie  >ARG0
Fairchild  
at  
Prudential  
Steamboat  
Realty  
,  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
helpful  V04
.  

She  >>ARG0
worked  V01
with  
us  <ARG3
for  
over  
a  
year  <ARGM-TMP
,  
helping  V01
us  >ARG0
find  V01
our  
perfect  
home  <ARG1
.  

Stephanie  
's  
knowledge  >ARG0
of  
the  
market  
and  
properties  
in  
our  
price  
range  
,  
made  V02
us  >ARG0
feel  V01
secure  <ARG1
in  
our  >ARG0
decision  V01
to  
buy  V01
when  
we  
did  V01
.  

We  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
Stephanie  <ARG1
to  
anyone  >ARG0
looking  V01
for  
a  
home  <ARG1
in  
the  
Yampa  
Valley  
.  

We  >ARG0
appreciated  V02
her  
patience  <ARG1
,  
knowledge  
and  
kindness  
!  

Great  
Barber  

Firstly  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
other  
reviewer  >>ARG1
clearly  >>ARGM-ADV
has  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
been  V01
to  
Nick  <ARG2
's  
,  
or  
he  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
know  V01
that  
Nick  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
charges  V01
$  <ARG1
13  
for  
a  
haircut  <ARG3
which  >ARG1
is  V01
pretty  
much  <ARGM-ADV
industry  
standard  <ARG2
.  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
going  V02
to  
Nick  <ARG4
for  
5  
months  <ARGM-TMP
now  <ARGM-TMP
precisely  
because  
he  >>>ARG0
does  V01
pay  VLV
attention  V02
to  
detail  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
terrible  
hair  <ARG1
and  
he  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
takes  V01
his  
time  <ARG1
to  
make  V02
it  >>ARG1
look  V02
right  V03
.  

Some  >>ARG1
of  
the  
younger  
kids  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
work  V01
there  <ARG2
are  V01
a  
bit  
sub  
par  <ARG2
,  
but  
if  
you  >ARG1
wait  V01
for  
Nick  <ARG2
...  
you  >>ARG1
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
good  V02
.  

UGH  
!!!  

Got  V01
some  
nice  
"  
freshly  >ARGM-TMP
baked  V01
"  
fruit  
squares  <ARG1
,  
a  
personal  
favorite  
of  
mine  
.  

Took  VLV
a  
bite  V01
,  
it  >ARG1
tasted  V02
odd  <ARG2
.  

Flipped  V01
the  
square  <ARG1
over  <ARGM-PRD
and  
saw  V01
it  <ARG1
riddled  
with  
green  
mold  
!!!!  

Ugh  
!!  

I  >ARG0
called  V02
the  
store  <ARG1
and  
the  
clerk  >>>ARG0
giggled  V01
,  
and  
agreed  V01
that  
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
gross  V05
,  
but  
said  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
her  
problem  <ARG2
.  

She  >>ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
refused  V01
to  
get  V01
a  
manager  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
left  V12
my  
number  <ARG1
,  
or  
tried  V01
to  <ARG1
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Same  
clerk  >>ARG0
had  V04
considerable  
difficulty  <ARG1
taking  V22
down  
a  
number  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
there  <ARGM-LOC
again  <ARGM-TMP

For  
cheap  
Chinese  
food  >ARGM-PRP
,  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
place  >ARG4
to  
go  V02
.  

I  >>ARG0
used  V03
to  
eat  V01
at  
places  <ARGM-LOC
like  
New  
China  
or  
Green  
Buffet  
in  
Troy  
,  
MO  
-  
nothing  
terrible  
but  
not  
that  
great  
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
eat  V01
fast  
food  <ARG1
Chinese  
unless  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
from  
this  
place  <ARG2
.  

The  
best  
value  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
found  V01
from  
a  
Chinese  
restaurant  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
live  V01
in  
Lake  <ARGM-LOC
St.  
Louis  
anymore  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
deliveries  V01
were  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
correct  V02
and  
the  
service  V02
courteous  
.  

Now  
I  >>>ARG0
have  V02
to  
be  V01
in  
the  
area  <ARG2
to  
get  V01
some  
lovin'  <ARG1
:  
sad  
face  
:  

Amazing  >ARGM-ADJ
Experience  V01
!  

My  >ARG0
experience  V01
was  V01
amazing  V01
at  
Providence  
Aesthetics  <ARGM-LOC
and  
Medical  
Spa  
.  

Jana  >ARG1
Kueck  
was  V01
nothing  <ARG2
but  
professional  
.  

She  >ARG0
makes  V02
you  >ARG0
feel  V01
like  
you  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
most  
important  
person  <ARG2
in  
the  
world

Jana  >ARG0
made  V02
me  >ARG0
feel  V01
very  
comfortable  <ARG1
.  

Provided  V01
me  <ARG2
with  
warm  
blanket  <ARG1
and  
has  V04
soft  
music  >ARG1
playing  V11
.  

Walking  V01
in  
the  
door  <ARG2
you  >>>ARG1
are  V03
made  V02
to  
feel  V01
happy  V01
and  
relaxed  
.  

Equipment  >ARG1
is  V01
state  <ARG2
of  
the  
art  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
reccomend  V01
anyone  >>>ARG0
to  
go  V05
see  V01
Jana  <ARG1
Kueck  
and  
Robin  
Talley

see  V01
all  
the  
many  >ARGM-ADJ
procedures  V01
they  >ARG0
have  V03
to  
offer  V01
.  

Dave  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
patient  
and  
methodical  
teacher  >ARG0
,  
who  >R-ARG0
has  V03
a  
great  
ear  <ARG1
and  
sensitivity  
for  
his  
students  
'  
passion  
and  
the  
direction  >>>ARGM-DIR
they  >ARG0
want  V01
their  >ARG2
lessons  V01
to  
take  V01
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >>ARG0
loves  V01
teaching  V01
so  
much  <ARGM-ADV
,  
his  >ARG0
price  V01
is  V01
unbeatable  <ARG2
,  
but  
that  >>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
change  V01
his  
level  <ARG1
of  
skill  
.  

Dave  >ARG0
has  V03
much  >ARG1
to  
offer  V01
.  

In  
just  
2  >ARGM-ADJ

3  
focused  >ARGM-PRD
lessons  V01
,  
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V01
already  >ARGM-TMP

Bad  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02
starting  V01

a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
lower  V04
:)  
The

very  
nice  <ARG2
and  
clean  
,  
and  
in

up  <C-V
when  >>ARGM-TMP
my  
car  >>ARG1
was  V01
finished  V01

The

review  V01
from  
2005  <ARGM-TMP
is  V01
out  
of  
date  <ARG2
.  

There  
was  V02
a  
change  V01
of  
ownership  V01
a  
couple  
of  
years  
ago  <<<ARGM-TMP
and  
service  V02
is  V01
both  
quick  V02
and  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
friendly  V01
.  

The  
food  >>>ARG1
continues  V01
to  
be  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
good  V02
--  
deli  
sandwiches  
,  
homemade  
soups  
,  
fresh  
salads  
.  

The  
atmosphere  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
for  
everyone  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
bustling  
place  >>ARGM-LOC
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
separate  
parties  >>ARG1
are  V03
seated  V01
at  
the  
same  
table  <ARG2
(  
as  
in  
many  
European  
cafes  <ARGM-ADV
)  
,  
but  
if  
you  >ARG1
are  V01
OK  >>ARGM-ADV
with  
that  
,  
the  
food  >>ARG1
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
good  V02
.  

Love  V01
the  
soups  <ARG1
.

New  
Italian  
Kid  
on  
the  
Block  

Another  
Italian  
restaurant  
in  
Collingswood  
?  

Do  V01
we  >ARG0
need  V01
another  
one  <ARG1
?  

Only  
if  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
of  
the  
quality  <ARG2
of  
That  >ARG1

Amore  <ARG2
.  

The  
menu  >ARG0
has  V03
the  
usual  <ARG1
but  
then  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
step  V03
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
another  
notch  <ARGM-EXT
.  

The  
arancini  
di  
riso  >>>ARG1
(  
risotto  
fritters  
)  
are  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
to  
be  V03
missed  V02
.  

Chicken  
saltimboca  >>ARG1
was  V01
excellent  V02
and  
then  >ARGM-ADV
there  
's  V02
the  
chocolate  
mousse  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
comes  V01
straight  
from  
heaven  <ARG3
.  

Pay  VLV
extra  >ARGM-ADJ
attention  V02
to  
the  
appetizers  <ARG1
-  
the  
next  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
go  V02
there  <ARG4
I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
planning  V01
on  
ordered  V02
a  
few  <ARG1
instead  
of  
an

all  
other

this  
hotel  >ARG0
has  V03
everything  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
we  >>ARG0
are  V03
looking  V01
for  <C-ARG1
.  

It  
is  V01
the  
hospitality  >ARG0
from

that  >R-ARG0
makes  V02
it  >ARG1

to  
write  V01
a  
review  V01
or  
make  VLV
a  
complaint  V01

but  
after  
the  
way  V01
I  >>ARG2
was  V03
spoken  V01
to  <C-ARG2
by  
a  
member  >>ARG1
of  
staff  
at  
the

whose

believe  V01

Mrs  <ARG2

would  >ARGM-MOD
now  >ARGM-TMP
not  >ARGM-NEG
recommend  V01
this

If

treated  V01
in  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
the  
customers  >>ARG1

this  >ARG0
leaves  V05
a  
lot  >>ARG1
to  
be  V03
desired  V01

Nobody  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
spoken  V01

that  <ARGM-MNR

of  
how  
bad  >>ARG2
their

may  >>ARGM-MOD

Best  
Car  
Dealer  
in  
TX  

I  >ARG0
purchased  V01
a  
nissan  <ARG1
from  
this  
dealship  <ARG2
.  

The  
sales  
men  >>ARG0
were  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
knowledgeable  V01
about  
every  
aspect  <ARG1
of  
every  
car  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
looked  V01
at  <C-ARG1
.  

They  >>>ARG0
were  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
patient  V01
and  
helpful  V04
from  
showing  V01
the  
cars  <ARG1
to  
doing  V02
the  
paperwork  <ARG1
.  

The  
paperwork  >>>ARG1
was  V01
a  
very  >>ARGM-EXT
easy  V05
and  
smooth  V06
.  

They  >>ARG0
tried  V01
to  
run  V10
my  >ARG1
credit  >ARG3
score  V01
as  
less  <<ARGM-EXT
as  
possible  
so  
it  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hurt  V01
my  >ARG1
score  V01
.  

Overall  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
happy  V01
with  
the  
customer  >ARG2
service  V02
and  
my  >ARG0
purchase  V01
.  

If  
you  >>>ARG0
're  V03
looking  V04
to  
buy  V01
a  
car  <ARG1
,  
definitely  >>ARGM-ADV
give  VLV
them  >ARG1
a  
call  V02
.  

They  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
huge  
inventory  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG1
have  V01
been  V01
a  
patient  <ARG2
a  
NW  
hospital  
and  
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
great  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
had  V03
an  
80  
yr  
old  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
take  V01
of  <C-ARG1
sent  V01
to  
the  
ER  <ARG2
and  
long  >ARGM-TMP
stays  V01
in  
the  
hospital  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Yes  
,  
we  >>ARG1
had  V02
to  
wait  V01
,  
but  
ER  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
triage  
system  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
takes  V01
the  
most  
life  >ARG2
threatening  V01
cases  V04
first  <<<ARGM-TMP
.  

Any  
ER  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
the  
same  <ARG2
.  

As  
far  >>>ARGM-ADV
as  
being  V03
treated  V01
like  
a  
drug  
seeker  <ARG2
,  
that  >>ARG1
has  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
been  V01
my  >ARG0
experience  V01
.  

As  
a  
nurse  >ARGM-MNR
I  >ARG0
know  V01
about  
drug  
seekers  <ARG1
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
great  
hospital  <ARG2
and  
even  
better  
since  
it  >ARG1
became  V01
part  <ARG2
of  
the  
UW  
system  
.  

Wonderful  >ARGM-ADJ
Experience  V01

I  >ARG0
had  V03
immense  
pain  <ARG1
on  
a  
Sunday  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
,  
with  
friends  >ARG0
and  
family  
telling  V01
me  <ARG2
that  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
find  V01
a  
Dentist  <ARG1
on  
a  
Sunday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Dr.  >>>ARG0
Taylor  
was  V01
not  
only  
available  V02
on  
a  
Sunday  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
also  >>ARGM-ADV
was  V01
able  V01
to  
immediately  >>ARGM-TMP
take  VLV
care  V03
of  
me  <ARG1
.  

He  >>>ARG0
was  V01
incredibly  
informative  <ARG2
about  
the  
options  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
had  V03
,  
giving  V01
me  <ARG2
opinions  <ARG1
on  
different  >ARGM-ADJ
treatments  V03
to  
choose  V01
from  <C-ARG2
.  

Coming  V01
from  
a  
person  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
hates  V01
the  
dentist  <ARG1
in  
general  <ARGM-ADV
,  
Dr.  >ARG1
Taylor  
was  V01
the  
best  <ARG2
!  

He  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
made  V02
the  
visit  V01
a  
pain  
free  
one  <<ARG1
with  
excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02
!  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend  V01
him  <ARG1
to  
everyone  <ARG2
!  

HORRIBLE  

This  
school  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
worst  
one  >>ARG2
i  >>ARG1
've  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
been  V01
to  <C-ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
attended  V01
it  <ARG1
for  
2  
years  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
that  >>ARG1
was  V01
enough  V01
.  

There  
's  V02
holes  <ARG1
everywhere  
in  
the  
ceiling  
,  
sewage  >ARG1
constantly  >ARGM-TMP
leaks  V01
through  
the  
ceiling  <ARGM-DIR
,  
and  
the  
whole  
condition  >>ARG1
of  
the  
school  
is  V01
horrible  V01
.  

The  
staff  >ARG1
and  
the  
Principal  
are  V01
rediculous  <ARG2
,  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
listen  V01
to  
any  
input  V02
,  
and  
they  >ARG0
make  V10
up  
rediculous  >ARGM-ADJ
rules  V01
(  
They  >ARG0
banned  V01
backpacks  <ARG1
,  
because  
a  
teacher  >ARG0
TRIPPED  V04
OVER  
a  
student  <ARG1
's  
)  
.  

The  
education  V01
is  V01
horrible  V01
at  
best  <ARGM-ADV
,  
do  V02
society  <ARG2
a  
favor  <ARG1
,  
and  
do  V01
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
send  V03
your  
student  <ARG1
here  <ARG4
.  

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
customer  >ARG2
service  V02
and  
quality  >ARGM-ADJ
work  V01
.  

They  >>ARG0
went  V02
the  
extra  
mile  <ARG1
to  
repair  V01
my  
cowboy  
boots  <ARG1
--  
they  >>>ARG0
had  V02
to  
have  V03
a  
special  
kind  >ARG0
of  
paper  
that  >R-ARG0
looked  V02
like  
wood  
grain  <ARG1
to  
fix  V02
the  
heels  <ARG1
.  

That  >ARG1
was  V01
4  
years  
ago  <ARG2
.  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
been  V01
able  V01
to  
find  V01
a  
shoe  >ARG1
repair  V01
place  >>>ARG0
in  
Seattle  
since  <<ARGM-TMP
that  >>>R-ARG0
has  V01
been  V01
able  V01
to  
do  V02
it  <ARG1
.  

(  
I  >>ARG1
've  V01
been  V01
through  
at  
least  
5  
places  <ARG2
already  <ARGM-TMP
.  
)  

If  
I  >ARG0
had  V03
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
drive  V01
to  
Tacoma  <ARGM-GOL
before  
they  >ARG1
closed  V01
during  
the  
work  
week  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  
would  
just  
so  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
get  V04
those  
boots  >ARG1
fixed  V02
properly  <ARGM-MNR
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

So  >ARGM-EXT
Handy  V02
for  
Local  
La  
Jolla  
Stuff  
-  
Especially  
for  
Finding  V01
Residential  
Numbers  <ARG1

Since  
moving  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
from  
college  <ARGM-DIR
and  
trying  V01
to  
settle  V03
roots  <ARG1
in  
the  
Village  
,  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
referred  V03
to  
the  
La  
Jolla  
Blue  
Book  <ARG1
for  
a  
ton  <ARG2
of  
local  
numbers  
.  

The  
white  
pages  >ARG0
allowed  V01
me  >ARG1
to  
get  V03
in  
touch  V01
with  
parents  <ARG1
of  
my  
high  
school  
friends  
so  
that  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
track  V02
people  <ARG1
down  <C-V
one  <ARGM-MNR
by  
one  
and  
the  
restaurant  
section  >ARG1
is  V01
basically  <ARGM-ADV
my  
cookbook  <ARG2
.  

It  
's  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
cool  V04
that  
so  
many  
local  
businesses  >>ARG1
are  V03
found  V01
so  
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
in  
one  
place  <ARGM-LOC
and  
I  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
spread  V03
the  
word  <ARG1
.  

THX  
:-)  

The  
staff  >>ARG0
do  V01
occasionally  >ARGM-TMP
get  V04
game  
info  >ARG1
correct  V02
,  
but  
if  
you  >>>ARG1
r  V03
looking  V01
fot  
a  
good  
game  <ARG1
and  
are  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
a  
nerd  <ARG2
,  
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
ask  V01
them  <ARG2
.  

The  
last  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
did  V02
that  <ARG1
I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
suggested  V01
to  
buy  V01
oblivion  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
told  V01
them  <ARG2
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
looking  V01
for  
a  
fps  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
knew  V01
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
was  V01
and  
told  V01
the  
guy  <ARG2
that  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
a  
fps  <ARG2
.  

He  >>ARG0
tried  V01
to  
tell  V01
me  <ARG2
it  >ARG1
was  V01
when  
I  >>ARG0
told  V01
asked  V01
him  <ARG2
if  
he  >ARG0
knew  V01
what  >ARG1
fps  >ARG0
stood  V08
for  <C-ARG1
and  
he  >ARG0
had  V03
no  
clue  <ARG1
.  

Overall  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG1
are  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
very  
knowledge  <ARG2
about  
the  
type  
of  
games  >ARG1
are  V01
on  
the  
market  <ARG2
.  

First  
and  
Last  
time  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
eat  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC

My  
friend  >ARG0
and  
I  
went  V02
there  <ARG4
for  
lunch  <ARGM-PRP
today  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Neither  
one  >>ARG1
of  
us  
had  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
been  V01
-  
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
thought  V01
we  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
try  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

BIG  >ARGM-ADJ
MISTAKE  V02
-  
The  
food  >>ARG1
was  V01
tasteless  <ARG2
and  
cold  V01
.  

We  >>>ARG0
both  
kept  V02
trying  V01
to  
find  V01
something  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
liked  V01
.  

The  
only  
thing  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
found  V02
edible  <ARG1
were  V01
the  
potato  
wedges  <ARG2
,  
I  >ARG0
finally  >ARGM-TMP
gave  V07
up  
,  
he  >>ARG0
kept  V02
trying  V01
-  
he  >ARG0
found  V02
the  
fried  
wantons  >ARG1
to  
be  V01
OK  <ARG2
-  
His  
Mongolian  
bowl  >>ARG1
was  V01
awful  V01
.  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
recommend  V01
this  
place  <ARG1
to  
anyone  <ARG2
-  
in  
fact  >>ARGM-ADV
-  
save  V01
your  
money  <ARG1
and  
go  V02
somewhere  <ARG4
else  
.  

Liquidweb.com  >ARG0
Rocks  V03
!!!  

I  >ARG1
am  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
client  <ARG2
of  
liquidweb.com  
,  
but  
one  >>ARG1
of  
my  
friend  
called  V01
Steven  <ARG2
is  V01
the  
client  >ARG0
having  V03
several  
websites  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
work  V01
with  
him  <ARG3
and  
since  
past  
6  
years  >>ARGM-TMP
he  >>ARG0
is  V03
hosting  V01
his  
websites  <ARG1
to  
Liquidweb  <ARGM-GOL
.  

As  
I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
gone  V02
through  
many  
reviews  
sites  <ARG1
to  
see  V01
if  
any  
provider  >>ARG0
is  V03
providing  V01
better  >ARGM-ADJ
services  V01
or  
not  
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
realized  V01
that  
there  
were  V02
many  >ARGM-ADJ
good  >ARGM-ADJ
reviews  V01
about  
Liquidweb  <ARG1
also  >ARGM-ADV
Steven  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
faced  V01
any  
server  >ARG0
issues  V02
in  
his  
whole  
hosting  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
kind  >>>ARG1
of  
support  V01
they  >ARG0
provide  V01
is  V01
simply  >ARGM-ADV
great  V01
!!!  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
host  V01
my  
upcoming  
website  <ARG1
to  
Liquidweb.com  <ARGM-GOL

The

the

were  V01
mind  
-  
blowing  <ARG2
,  
the

Top

David  >>ARG0
is  V01
amazing  V01

David  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
most  
helpful  
and  
creative  
photographer  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
used  V01
.  

He  >>>ARG0
is  V01
willing  V02
to  
do  V02
whatever  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
need  V01
from  
him  <ARGM-ADV
without  
hesitation  V01
.  

He  >>>ARG0
was  V01
patient  V01
and  
adapted  V01
when  >>ARGM-TMP
everything  >>ARG1
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go  V01
according  
to  
schedule  <ARGM-MNR
on  
my  
wedding  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Both  
the  
engagement  V01
and  
wedding  V01
pictures  >>ARG0
that  
he  
took  
for  
us  
we  V01
absolutely  >ARGM-ADV
amazing  V01
.  

He  >ARG0
got  V01
the  
pictures  <ARG1
back  
to  
me  <ARG4
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
David  <ARG1
to  
anyone  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
exceed  V01
your  >ARG0
expectations  V01
!  

He  >>ARG0
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADV
take  V01
pictures  <ARG1
he  >ARG0
makes  V01
art  <ARG1
out  
of  
them  <ARG2
and  
you  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
notice  V01
that  
there  
's  V02
a  
camera  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Not  
so  
great  

My  
husband  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
got  V01
a  
bike  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
as  
a  
gift  <ARGM-PRD
he  >>ARG0
's  V03
only  >ARGM-ADV
had  V03
it  <ARG1
a  
month  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
nice  
bike  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
cost  V01
a  
lot  <ARG2
of  
money  
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
just  
this  
week  >ARGM-TMP
a  
peddle  >ARG1
broke  V01
.  

He  >ARG0
took  V01
it  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
and  
they  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
honor  V02
a  
warranty  <ARG1
and  
said  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
his  >ARG1
fault  V01
because  
of  
his  
shoes  <<ARGM-CAU
??  

So  >>>ARGM-DIS
they  >>>ARG0
were  V03
going  V04
to  
charge  V01
him  <ARG2
for  
new  
peddles  <ARG3
and  
proceeded  V01
to  
put  V01
them  <ARG1
on  <ARG2
without  
even  >ARGM-ADV
telling  V01
him  <ARG2
the  
price  V01
.  

Which  >>ARG1
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
expensive  V02
.  

He  >ARG0
asked  V02
for  
a  
different  
pair  <ARG1
instead  <ARGM-ADV
and  
they  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
gave  V01
him  <ARG2
five  
dollars  <ARG1
off  
??  

Trek  >>ARG1
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
so  >ARGM-EXT
great  V01

Only  
Concerned  
With  
Money  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
getting  V01
my  >ARG1
treatments  V03
for  
a  
few  
months  <<ARGM-TMP
now  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
have  V01
seen  V01
some  
results  <ARG1
but  
not  
up  
to  
the  
standards  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG2
was  V03
told  V01
I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
expect  V01
.  

The  
people  >>ARG1
there  
attempt  V01
to  
come  V15
across  
and  
professional  <ARG3
and  
nice  
,  
but  
I  >ARG1
was  V01
disappointed  <ARG2
with  
their  >ARG0
customer  >ARG2
service  V02
.  

Never  >ARGM-NEG
miss  V02
an  
appointment  V02
because  
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
charge  V01
you  <ARG2
the  
price  V01
of  
a  
treatment  V03
,  
even  
if  
you  >ARG0
had  V03
an  
emergency  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
pretty  
ridiculous  <ARG2
!  

They  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
squeeze  V02
as  
much  <ARG1
as  
they  
can  
from  
you  <ARG2
even  
if  
you  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-TMP
got  V03
in  
a  
car  
accident  <ARG2
!!!!  

They  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
care  V01
one  
bit  <ARGM-EXT
about  
you  <ARG1
!!!!!  

Terrible  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02
!!!  

Made  VLV
an  
appointment  V02
to  
have  V04
them  >>>ARG0
come  V01
to  
the  
house  <ARG4
to  
discuss  V01
curtain  
options  <ARG1
and  
give  VLV
an  
estimate  V01
.  

They  >ARG0
sent  V02
over  <ARGM-DIR
someone  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
said  V01
he  >>>ARG0
knows  V01
nothing  <ARG1
about  
curtains  
and  
could  >>>ARGM-MOD
not  >>>ARGM-NEG
show  V01
me  <ARG2
fabric  
options  <ARG1
or  
give  VLV
an  
estimate  V01
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
called  V02
the  
manager  <ARG1
to  
complain  V01
,  
she  >ARG0
said  V01
she  >ARG0
KNEW  V01
the  
guy  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
about  
curtains  <ARG1
and  
that  
the  
usual  
lady  >ARG0
called  V04
in  
sick  <ARG1
hours  <ARG1
earlier  <ARGM-TMP
!  

Instead  
of  
rescheduling  V01
they  >>ARG0
chose  V01
to  
waste  V01
my  
time  <ARG1
instead  <ARGM-ADV
.  

So  
what  
was  
the  
point  
of  
the  
appointment  V02
!?!  

To  
just  >ARGM-ADV
come  V01
over  <ARGM-DIR
and  
hang  V06
out  
?!?  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
business  <ARG1
with  
this  
company  
!  

EVER  
!!!  

Internet  
Department  >>>ARG0
is  V01
rude  V01
and  
insulting  V01

I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
looking  V04
to  
bring  V01
a  
customer  >ARG0
to  
their  
lot  <ARG2
to  
buy  V01
a  
car  <ARG1
but  
the  
Internet  
salesperson  >>ARG0
Last  
name  >ARG1
is  V01
Balazick  <ARG2
sent  V01
me  <ARG2
this  
email  V01
"  
AND  
IF  
IT  >>ARG1
WAS  V01
WORTH  V02
MY  
TIME  <ARG2
I  >>>ARG0
WOULD  >>ARGM-MOD
OF  V01
BOTHERED  V02
ASWERING  V01
YOUR  >ARG0
QUESTIONS  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
MAKE  V05
MONEY  <ARG1
NOT  
DEAL  V01
WITH  
BROKERS  <ARG1
"  
Wow  >ARGM-DIS
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
believe  V01
in  
today  
s  
tough  
times  >>ARGM-TMP
this  
dealership  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
looking  V01
for  
any  
way  V01
to  
move  V01
vehicles  <ARG1
.  

As  
a  
previous  
Internet  
Manager  >>>ARGM-ADV
I  >>>ARG0
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
deal  V01
with  
anyone  >>ARG0
looking  V04
to  
buy  V01
a  
car  <ARG1
for  
a  
profit  V01
and  
not  
care  V01
if  
they  >ARG1
came  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
with  
a  
broker  <ARGM-COM
.  

Stay  V01
away  <ARG3
from  
this  
dealership  
!!!  

This  
place  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
Rip  
-  
Off  <ARG2

I  >>ARG0
brought  V01
a  
car  <ARG1
in  <ARG3
to  
have  V04
the  
"  
check  V01
engine  <ARG1
"  
light  >ARG1
diagnosed  V01
back  
in  
March  <<<ARGM-TMP
of  
2010  
.  

They  >ARG0
said  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
"  
plugs  <ARG2
and  
wires  
"  
and  
quoted  V01
me  <ARGM-GOL
$  <ARG1
330  
to  
do  VLV
the  
work  V01
,  
including  
parts  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

I  >ARG0
asked  V01
why  
so  
high  <ARG1
and  
they  >ARG0
said  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
due  
to  
the  
labor  V01
of  
moving  V01
things  <ARG1
out  
of  
the  
way  V01
.  

Those  
things  >>ARG1
ended  V03
up  
being  V01
a  
windsheild  
washer  
fluid  
tank  <ARG2
(  
1  
screw  
)  
and  
the  
air  
filter  
canister  
(  
4  
spring  
clips  
)  
.  

I  >>ARG0
did  VLV
the  
work  V01
myself  <ARGM-REC
for  
$  <ARGM-PRP
50  
.  

There  
's  V02
no  >ARGM-NEG
excuse  V02
for  
that  
kind  <ARG1
of  
estimate  V01
.  

My  
girlfriend  >>ARG0
and  
I  
took  VLV
a  
chance  V01
on  
this  
place  <ARGM-LOC
because  
we  >>>ARG1
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
wait  V01
in  
line  <ARGM-LOC
at  
Outback  <ARGM-LOC

What  
an  
amazing  >ARGM-ADJ

(  
most

)  
#  
3  
the  
food  >>ARG1

FANTASTIC  V02

cuisine  <ARG2
;  
fresh  
ingredients  >>ARG1
expertly  >ARGM-MNR
prepared  V01
and  
seasoned  V01
perfectly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

The  
portions  >>ARG2
were  V01
generous  V01
and  
we  >ARG1
got  V05
out  <ARGM-PRD
for  
less  <ARGM-ADV
than  
the  
cost  
of  
one  
entree  
at  
some  
chain  
restaurant  
.

It  >ARG1
's  V01
only  
$  <ARG2

and  
in

just  
one  
big  
petting

They  >ARG0
sell  V01

milk  
bottles

We  >ARG0
took  V01
our  
7

giggled  V01
when  >>ARGM-TMP

add  V01
)  
grabbing  V01
and  
'  
kissed  V01
'  
the

all  >ARGM-ADV

sweet  V03

patient  V01

her  <ARG2

Among  
the  
animals  >>>ARG2
that  >>>R-ARG0

were  V01
pony's  <ARG1

EVEN

Wonderful

You  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
her  <ARG2
a  
try  <ARG1
-  
it  
's  V01
worth  V02
every  
penny  <ARG2
to  
know  V01
that  
you

in  
GREAT  
hands  <ARG2

The

talk  V01
down  <ARGM-MNR
to  
customers  <ARG2

are  V01
very  
argumentative  <ARG2

a  
business  <ARG3

4  
)  
The  
business  >ARG1

very  
unorganized  <ARG2
.  

The  
invoice  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
detailed  <ARG2
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
it  
is  V01
difficult  V01
to  
see  V01
what  >>ARG3
you  >>ARG0

paying  V01
for  <C-ARG3

I  >>>ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
recommend  V01
to  
save  V01
your  
time  <ARG1
and  
energy  
and  
find  V01
another  
greek  
store  <ARG1

the

is  V01
an  
absolute  
angel  <ARG2

The  
mark  V02
up  >>ARG1

minimal  V02
considering  V02
that  
the

hard  <ARG2

often  >ARGM-TMP

In  
addition  V02
,  
the  
clothing  >ARG1

much  
better

the

Over-rated  

Buddakan  >ARG0
inevitably  >ARGM-ADV
attracts  V01
the

its  >ARG1

deserves  V01
4  
stars  <ARG1
but  
,  
the  
food  >ARG1
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
up  
to  
par  <ARG2
with  
the  
price  >ARG2
tag  V01
and  
the  
reputation  >ARG1
the  
restaurant  >ARG0
carries  V01
.  

The  
server  >>>ARG0
we  >ARG0
had  V03
was  V01
knowledgeable  V01
but  
he  >>>ARG0
was  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
as  >ARGM-CXN
proper  V01
as  
he  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V01
,  
acting  V01
like  
he  >>ARG0
was  V03
talking  V01
to  
his  
friends  <ARG2
rather  
than  
his  
customers  
.  

The  
angry  
lobster  >ARG1
was  V01
completely  
over-priced  <ARG2
!  

$  
80  
for  
a  
dish  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
has  V03
about  
one  
small  
lobster  
tail  <ARG1
and  
is  V01
full  V01
of  
filler  
vegetables  <ARG2
!  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
there  <ARG4
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Alto  >ARG0
delivers  V01
on  
all  
levels  <ARGM-ADV
.  

From  
the  
moment  >>ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
enter  V01
the  
restaurant  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
know  V01
you  >ARG1
are  V01
some  
place  <ARG2
special  
.  

The  
service  V02
is  V01
impeccable  <ARG2
,  
and  
the  
food  >>ARG1
is  V01
even  >ARGM-EXT
better  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
the  
four  
-  
course  
tasting  
menu  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
gives  V01
you  <ARG2
plenty  <ARG1
of  
range  
and  
food  >ARG0
to  
satisfy  V01
your  
appetite  <ARG1
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
you  >ARG1
are  V01
into  
wine  >ARGM-ADV
,  
Alto  >ARG0
has  V03
the  
depth  >ARG0
of  
both  
region  
,  
varietal  
,  
and  
vintage  
to  
satisfy  V01
nearly  <ARGM-ADV
any  
sommelier  <ARG1
(  
or  
after  
9  
pm  >ARGM-TMP
,  
bring  V01
your  
own  
bottle  <ARG1
for  
free  <ARGM-ADV
...  
no  
corking  
fee  
!  
)  
.  

While  
it  >>ARG1
's  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
cheap  V02
,  
Alto  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
you  <ARG2
an  
experience  V01
you  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
forget  V01
.  

The  
landlord  >>>ARG0
is  V01
not  >>ARGM-NEG
nice  V01
nor  
helpful  V04

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
lived  V01
in  
Buckingham  
Condominiums  
townhouse  <ARGM-LOC
for  
2  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
love  V01
the  
location  <ARG1
and  
the  
apartment  
!!  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01
a  
single  
female  <ARG2
and  
I  >>>ARG1
feel  V01
safe  V01
coming  V01
home  <ARG4
at  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
maintenance  
people  >>ARG0
are  V01
AWESOME  V01
!!!!  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
exterminator  >>ARG1
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
nice  V01
,  
also  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-ADV
have  V03
a  
few  
bugs  <ARG1
,  
but  
that  >>>ARG1
's  V03
going  V04
to  
be  V01
anywhere  >ARG4
you  >ARG0
go  V02
!  

The  
only  
problem  >>>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
experienced  V01
is  V01
the  
landlord  <ARG2
.  

She  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
pure  
b****  <ARG2
!!!  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
that  >ARG1
's  V01
ugly  <ARG2
...  
but  
she  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
help  V03
you  <ARG2
out  <C-V
for  
anything  <ARGM-ADV
...  
sad  
story  
.  

Other  
than  
that  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend  V01
living  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  
:)  

The  
staff  >ARG0
leaves  V05
a  
lot  >>ARG1
to  
be  V03
desired  V01
.  

The  
front  
staff  >>>ARG1
has  V01
seen  V01
quite  
a  
bit  <ARG1
of  
turnover  V01
and  
changed  V01
from  
professional  <ARG3
to  
rude  <ARG2
.  

A  
simple  >ARGM-ADJ
follow  >ARGM-PRP
-  
up  
phone  >ARGM-MNR
call  V02
with  
a  
woman  <ARG1
quickly  >ARGM-MNR
turned  V02
into  
a  
nightmare  <ARG2
.  

She  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
the  
reason  <ARG2
for  
all  
the  
change  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
sincerely  >ARGM-MNR
wonder  V01
if  
the  
doctor  >ARG0
has  V03
a  
clue  <ARG1
about  
what  >>ARG1
is  V03
going  V15
on  
within  
his  
practice  <ARGM-LOC
.  

If  
he  >>>ARG0
does  V01
know  V01
and  
approves  V01
of  
this  
behavior  <ARG1
then  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
poor  >ARGM-MNR
reflection  V01
on  
him  <ARG2
.  

Sometimes  >>ARGM-TMP
it  
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
worth  V02
it  <ARG2
to  
go  V12
through  
that  
kind  <ARG2
of  
staff  
and  
their  
personal  
attitude  
to  
get  V05
to  
a  
doctor  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG1
was  V01
an  
okay  
doctor  <ARG2
but  
not  
worth  
her  
.

a  
scene  <ARG1

unparalleled  
beauty

I  >ARG0
saw  V01
deer  <ARG1
frequently  <ARGM-TMP

in  
fact  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
small  
herd  >>ARG1
were  V03
grazing  V01
near

There  
were  V02
occasional

on  
the  
deck  <ARGM-LOC
in  
the  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
.  

and  >>ARGM-DIS
most  
correctly  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
us  >>ARG0
visitors  
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
mingle  V01
with  
the  
native  
wildlife  <ARG1
.  

It  >>>ARG1
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V01
more  V01
than  
one  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
bear  V01
!  

Kathy  >ARG1
and  
Stewart  
,  
the  
proprietors  
were  V01
the  
epitome  <ARG2

Delightful

superb

I  >>ARG1
hope  V01
to

back  <ARG2

junkie

really  
weird  
place  
,  
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
driving  V01
home  <ARG1
from  
work  V01
thought  V01
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
stop  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
for  
an  
oil  >ARG1
change  V01
and  
well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
there  
are  V02
a  
few  
guys  >>>ARG0
in  
jiffy  
lube  
uniforms  
sitting  V01
at  
the  
table  <ARG2
drinking  V01
beers  <ARG1
and  
shooting  V01
the  
breeze  <ARG1
.  

The  
neon  
lighting  
sign  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
said  V01
"  
on  <ARG1
"  
yet  
some  
guy  >>>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG1
seemed  V01
to  
be  V01
the  
oldest  <ARG2
of  
the  
bunch  
,  
more  
like  
the  
drunkest  
of  
the  
bunch  
told  V01
me  <ARG2
they  >>ARG1
'd  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
open  V01
tomorrow  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
asked  V01
if  
a  
manager  >ARG1
was  V01
on  
duty  <ARG2
he  >ARG0
told  V01
me  <ARG2
he  >ARG1
was  V01
.  

WOW  
!  

grey  
shirt  
"  
mark  
"  
of  >>>ARGM-ADV
course  
with  
this  
type  
behavior  >>>ARGM-ADV
he  >>>ARG0
could  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V03
wearing  V01
someon  
else  
s  
clothing  <ARG1
.....  

A  
friend  >ARG0
and  
I  
recently  >ARGM-TMP
took  V01
our  
16  <ARG1
and  
18  
month  
olds  
here  <ARG3
.  

While  
there  
was  V02
n't  <ARGM-NEG
too  
much  <ARG1
available  
for  
their  
age  
(  
ball  
pit  
,  
bouncy  
area  
and  
a  
little  
padded  
pyramid  >ARG1
to  
climb  V01
on  <C-ARG1
)  
,  
we  >>>ARG1
went  V02
right  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
opened  V01
at  
10  
am  <ARGM-TMP
on  
a  
winter  
weekday  
and  
ended  V03
up  
being  V01
the  
only  
ones  <ARG2
there  
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG2
were  V03
given  V01
a  
little  
more  
liberty  <ARG1
than  
we  
would  
have  V01
if  
others  >>ARG1
had  V01
been  V01
there  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
classiest  
place  <ARG2
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
cleaner  V04
than  
I  >ARG0
expected  V01
and  
the  
staff  >>ARG1
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
friendly  V01
.  

For  
$  >ARGM-ADV
4  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
break  V19
from  
the  
monotony  <ARG1
of  
winter  
indoors  
with  
a  
toddler  
.  

Restored  V01
my  
faith  <ARG1
in  
Mechaincs  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
spent  V02
3  
months  <ARG1
going  V02
from  
shop  <ARG3
to  
shop  <ARG4
trying  V01
to  
get  V04
my  
Ferrari  >>ARG1
to  
run  V01
and  
drive  V01
the  
way  V01
it  
should  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
was  V01
about  
to  
give  V07
up  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
met  V02
Jason  <ARG1
and  
Neal  
.  

They  >ARG0
took  V21
on  
the  
challenge  V01
of  
making  V02
my  
Ferrari  <ARG1
all  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
dreamed  V01
of  <C-ARG1
and  
more  
.  

The  
crew  >>>ARG0
at  
The  
Creative  
Workshop  
went  V02
over  
and  
above  
the  
call  V03
of  
duty  <ARG0
and  
gave  V03
me  <ARG2
back  <C-V
a  
car  >>>ARG1
I  >>>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
drive  V01
anywhere  <ARGM-DIR
and  
finally  >ARGM-TMP
enjoy  V01
owning  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
say  V01
enough  <ARG1
about  
this  
place  <ARG3
.  

They  >>ARG0
have  V01
restored  V01
my  
faith  <ARG1
in  
Mechanics  
.  

Do  V02
yourself  <ARG2
a  
favor  <ARG1
,  
call  V02
these  
guys  <ARG1
first  <ARGM-TMP
and  
enjoy  V01
driving  V01
your  
car  <ARG1
again  <<ARGM-TMP
..  

a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
vacation  V01
!  

We  >>ARG0
wanted  V01
to  
see  V01
the  
sun  <ARG1
-  
and  
we  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
got  V01
much  
more  <ARG1
!  

Excellent  
chefs  >>ARG0
are  V01
in  
the  
kitchen  <ARG2
preparing  V01
memorable  
breakfasts  <ARG1
.  

After  
a  
train  >ARG1
ride  V01
over  
the  
mountains  <ARGM-DIR
,  
we  >ARG0
enjoyed  V01
hiking  V01
in  
the  
flower  
-  
filled  
Wenatchee  
hills  <ARG1
(  
in  
May  <ARGM-TMP
)  
and  
a  
very  
interesting  >ARGM-ADJ
bike  >ARG1
ride  V01
in  
a  
loop  <ARGM-LOC
around  
the  
Columbia  
River  
...  
and  
then  
wine  
if  
we  >ARG0
wanted  V01
it  <ARG1
on  
the  
patio  
in  
the  
evening  
....  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
busy  
group  <ARG2
of  
hosts  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
also  >ARGM-ADV
running  V01
a  
restaurant  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
also  >>ARGM-DIS
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
wonderful  V03
-  
so  >ARGM-ADV
just  >ARGM-ADV
ask  V02
for  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
need  V01
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
sure  V02
they  >>ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
their  
best  <ARG1
to  
be  V01
hospitable  <ARG2
.  

OMG  

OMG  >ARGM-DIS
..  
make  V02
sure  V01
to  
book  V03
a  
reservation  V01
,  
as  
this  
magical  
place  >ARG1
is  V01
packed  <ARG2
(  
in  
a  
nice  >ARGM-MNR
way  V01
)  
I  >ARG0
love  V01
that  
the  
owner  >>ARG0
walks  V01
around  <ARG2
and  
cares  V01
how  >ARG1
his  
customers  >ARG0
feel  V01
about  
their  
food  <ARG2
.  

The  
waiters  >ARG1
are  V01
like  
no  
other  <ARG2
...  

My  
waiter  >>ARG1
was  V01
so  >ARGM-ADV
excellent  V02
I  >ARG0
gave  V01
him  <ARG2
a  
75  
%  >ARG1
tip  V02
,  
and  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
worht  <ARG2
every  
penny  
..  

The  
food  >>>ARG1
was  V01
finger  >ARGM-MNR
licking  V01
the  
bowel  <ARG1
fantastic  V02
..  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
discovered  V01

choice  V01
.  

Holly  >ARG1

La  
Jolla

many  
years  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
I  
never  
new  
this  
salon  >ARG1
was  V01
here  <ARG2
until  
a  
friend  >ARG0
reffered  V02
me  >ARG0
to  
see  V01
Holly  <ARG1
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG1
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
pleased  V01
with  
my  >ARG0
experience  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

All  >>ARG1
of  
the  
people  
were  V01
friendly  V01
and  
welcoming  
.  

I  >ARG0
got  V01
highlights  <ARG1
,  
haircut  
,  
and  
a  
blowdry  
.  

She  >ARG0
did  V02
a  
great  
job  <ARG1
!  

Holly  >ARG1
is  V01
very  
experienced  <ARG2
and  
talented  
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
tell  V02
she  
new  <ARG1
what  >>ARG1
she  >>ARG0
was  V03
doing  V02
right  
off  
the  
bat  <<<ARGM-TMP

My  
hair  >>ARG0
looks  V02
amazing  V01
,  
and  
I  >ARG0
get  V01
compliments  <ARG1

I  >ARG0
deffenitly  >ARGM-ADV
reccomend  V01
this

to  
anyone  <ARG2

You  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
disappointed  V01
!!!!!!  

Outdated  
but  
not  
bad  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-EXT
felt  V02
like  
this  
place  >ARG1
was  V01
extremely  
outdated  <ARG2
especially  
since  
the  
pictures  >ARG0
make  V02
it  >>ARG1
look  V02
nice  V01
and  
modern  
.  

It  >>ARG0
had  V01
listed  V01
that  
there  
was  V02
a  
hot  
breakfast  <ARG1
but  
all  >>ARG1
this  >ARG1
meant  V01
is  V01
that  
they  >ARG0
added  V02
a  
waffle  
maker  <ARG1
to  
the  
common  
continental  
affair  <ARG2
at  
most  
cheap  
hotels  
.  

The  
family  
suite  >ARG1
was  V01
basically  <ARGM-ADV
two  
rooms  >>ARG1
with  
a  
small  >ARGM-ADJ
opening  V01
between  
them  <ARGM-LOC
which  >R-ARG1
worked  V09
great  <ARGM-MNR
for  
us  <ARG2
because  
we  >ARG1
were  V01
two  
families  >ARG0
traveling  V01
together  <ARGM-MNR
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
are  V01
in  
town  >>ARGM-ADV
and  
need  V01
that  
kind  <ARG1
of  
space  
I  >ARG0
say  V01
stay  V01
here  <ARG3
but  
if  
you  >>ARG0
are  V03
looking  V01
for  
a  
little  
more  
upscale  
affair  <ARG1
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
let  V01
the  
pictures  >ARG0
fool  V01
you  <ARG1
and  
book  V03
somewhere  <ARGM-LOC
else  
.  

Great  
,  
and  
probably  
the  
only  
West  
Indian  
spot  
worth  
hitting  V05
up  
in  
Nashville  
.  

I  >>>ARG1
was  V03
born  V02
and  
raised  V03
in  
Toronto  >ARG0
,  
which  >R-ARG0
has  V03
a  
huge  >ARGM-ADJ
West  
Indian  >ARG2
(  
Trinidadian  
,  
Jamaican  
,  
etc  
)  
population  V01
.  

So  
huge  
in  
fact  
,  
that  
Toronto  
slang  >>>ARG0
is  V03
influenced  V01
by  <ARG0
and  
has  V03
Jamaican  >ARGM-ADJ
references  V01
,  
and  
Jamaican  
beef  
patties  >ARG1
are  V01
staples  <ARG2
in  
my  
high  
school  
cafeteria  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Anyway  
,  
I  >>ARG1
was  V03
practically  >ARGM-ADV
raised  V03
on  
this  
stuff  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
being  V01
a  
connoisseur  >ARGM-ADV
of  
West  
Indian  
cuisine  
,  
Jamaica  
Way  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
bit  >ARGM-EXT
toned  V01
down  
to  
suit  V01
the  
American  
palette  <ARG2
.  

All  >>>ARG1
you  >>>ARG0
have  V02
to  
do  V02
to  
make  V02
it  <ARG1
authentic  
Jamaican  
food  <ARG1
,  
is  V01
add  V02
a  
whole  
lot  <ARG1
of  
pepper  
.  

A  
lot  
.  

The  
finest  
Christmas  
Trees  >>ARG1
i  >>ARG0
've  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
seen  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
felt  V01
like  
I  >ARG1
was  V01
in  
heaven  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
walked  V01
through  
the  
majestic  
fields  <ARG2
of  
this  
particular  
farm  
.  

The  
trees  >ARG1
were  V01
in  
magnificent  >ARGM-ADJ
shape  V01
and  
the  
variety  >>ARG0
was  V01
astounding  V01
.  

The  
owners  >>ARG0
were  V01
entertaining  <ARG2
and  
gracious  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
especially  >ARGM-EXT
liked  V01
the  
Eco  
friendly  
atmosphere  <ARG1
and  
the  
owner  >ARG0
s  
love  V01
of  
all  
animals  <ARG1
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
best  
farms  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG1
have  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
been  V01
too  <C-ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
call  V01
it  <ARG1
the  
Taj  
Mahal  <ARG2
of  
the  
east  
coast  
!  

It  >ARG0
put  V01
hair  <ARG1
on  
my  
chest  <ARG2
and  
thanks  V01
to  
the  
owner  
s  
advice  <ARG1
I  >>>ARG1
invested  V01
vanguard  <ARG2
,  
got  V01
myself  <ARG4
a  
woman  <ARG1
like  
Jerry  
,  
and  
became  V01
a  
republican  <ARG2
.  

Thanks  V01

Pho  
-  
nomenal  
!!  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
eating  V01
Pho  <ARG1
for  
almost  
my  
entire  
life  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
gone  V02
to  
the  
Pho  
places  <ARG4
in  
south  
philly  
and  
off  
the  
boulevard  
and  
even  
the  
other  
one  
in  
chinatown  
,  
but  
when  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
tried  V01
this  
pho  
place  <ARG1
,  
it  >ARG0
blew  V01
the  
other  
pho  
houses  <ARG1
away  <ARGM-DIR
!!  

all  >ARG1
of  
the  
pho  
places  
taste  V02
the  
same  <ARG2
to  
me  <ARGM-GOL
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
what  >>ARG1
seperates  V01
one  <ARG1
from  
the  
other  <ARG2
is  V01
the  
service  V02
and  
the  
price  V01
.  

The  
service  V02
here  <ARGM-LOC
is  V01
incredible  <ARG2
compared  
to  
the  
other  
places  <ARGM-ADV
.  

the  
only  
down  
fall  >ARG1
of  
this  
pho  
house  
is  V01
the  
difficulty  <ARG2
in  
finding  V01
parking  V01
in  
chinatown  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

remember  V01
to  
bring  V01
cash  <ARG1
since  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
take  V01
debit  <ARG1
or  
credit  
.  

hope  V01
this  >ARG0
helps  V01
!!  

Had  VLV
a  
horrible  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
with  
a  
manager  <ARG1
here  
,  
Rachel  
McInnis  
,  
she  >>>ARG0
was  V01
rude  V01
,  
inconsiderate  
and  
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
the  
right  
thing  <ARG1
for  
an  
item  >>ARG2
that  >>R-ARG2
was  V03
marked  V02
incorrectly  <ARGM-MNR
...  

I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
interested  V01
in  
shopping  V01
in  
a  
place  <ARGM-LOC
with  
people  
like  
her  
...  
she  >>ARG0
refused  V01
to  
sell  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
item  <ARG1
at  
its  >ARG1
marked  >ARGM-PRD
price  V01
even  
after  
admitting  V01
they  >>>ARG0
had  V01
made  VLV
a  
mistake  V02
.  

I  >>ARG0
normally  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
write  V01
reviews  V01
but  
seeing  V01
that  
I  >ARG0
considered  V01
Dillards  <ARG1
a  
distinguished  
,  
upscale  
place  >ARG2
to  
shop  V01
,  
this  
one  >>ARG0
wo  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
getting  V01
my  
business  <ARG1
,  
nor  
my  
family  
's  
,  
nor  
my  
co-workers  
.  

It  
's  V01
never  <ARGM-NEG
ok  <ARG2
to  
let  V01
a  
customer  >>ARG1
walk  V01
out  <ARG2
unhappy  V01
,  
especially  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
right  V06
.  

Highly  >ARGM-EXT
Recommend  V01

I  >ARG0
work  V01
as  
a  
Transformational  
Life  
Coach  <ARG1
.  

Since  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
an  
alternative  
therapy  >ARGM-CAU
I  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
refer  V02
clients  <ARG1
to  
a  
lisenced  
therapist  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
feel  V02
that  >>ARG1
is  V01
appropriate  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
found  V01
her  <ARG1
through  
a  
colleague  <ARGM-MNR
one  
day  <ARGM-TMP
when  >>>ARGM-TMP
one  >>>ARG0
of  
my  
clients  
was  V01
in  
the  
midst  <ARG2
of  
a  
panic  >ARGM-MNR
attack  V01
and  
needed  V01
professional  >ARG1
help  V01
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
am  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
qualified  <ARG2
to  
provide  V01
.  

Little  >ARGM-ADV
did  
I  >ARG0
know  V01
that  
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
soon  >>ARGM-TMP
be  V03
needing  V01
her  >ARG0
help  V01
as  <<ARGM-ADV
well  
!  

She  >ARG0
guided  V01
me  <ARG1
through  
a  
very  
difficult  
period  >ARGM-TMP
dealing  V01
with  
a  
family  
member  
's  
suicide  >ARG1
,  
coupled  V01
with  
elder  >ARG1
abuse  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
found  V02
her  >>>ARG0
to  
be  V01
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
solid  V02
,  
kind  V01
,  
compassionate  
,  
and  
intuitive  
as  
well  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend  V01
her  <ARG1
highly  <ARGM-EXT
!  

They  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
a  
second  >ARGM-TMP
chance  V02
from  
me  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

First  >ARGM-TMP
,  
let  V01
me  >ARG0
state  V01
that  
although  
I  >ARG0
live  V01
in  
NYC  <ARGM-LOC
,  
I  >ARG1
am  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
from  
NYC  <ARG2
,  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
care  V01
about  
baseball  <ARG1
and  
I  >ARG0
absolutely  >ARGM-EXT
love  V01
Boston  <ARG1
to  
death  V01
(  
so  
beautiful  
,  
so  
clean  
,  
so  
awesome  
)  
.  

That  >ARG1
said  V01
,  
I  >ARG0
hated  V01
this  
restaurant  <ARG1
.  

The  
service  V02
was  V01
just  
about  >ARGM-ADV
as  >ARGM-CXN
good  V02
as  
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
in  
NYC  <ARGM-LOC
(  
that  >ARG1
means  V01
it  >>ARG2
was  V01
poor  V02
)  
and  
the  
food  >ARG1
was  V01
almost  
mediocre  <ARG2
.  

The  
decor  >ARG0
left  V05
a  
lot  >>ARG1
to  
be  V03
desired  V01
and  
the  
posters  >>>ARG0
telling  V01
me  <ARG2
all  
the  
reasons  >>ARGM-CAU
99  >>ARG1
was  V01
great  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
served  V01
as  
an  
ironic  >ARGM-ADJ
contrast  V01
against  
the  
reality  <ARG2
.  

Personally  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
recommend  V01
you  >ARG0
take  V01
your  
money  <ARG1
elsewhere  <ARG3

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
arrived  V01
at  
Brickell  
Honda  <ARG4
on  
6/4/11  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>>ARG1
was  V03
greeted  V01
and  
attended  V01
to  <C-ARG1
by  
the  
Sales  
Manager  <ARG0
,  
Gustavo  
Guerra  
,  
in  
a  
very  
friendly  
and  
professional  
manner  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
explained  V01
to  
him  <ARG2
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
wanted  V01
and  
that  
I  >ARG0
previously  >ARGM-TMP
went  V02
to  
Braman  
Honda  <ARG4
.  

Bramen  
Honda  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
bit  <ARG2
of  
a  
hassle  V02
.  

He  >ARG0
told  V01
me  <ARG2
"  
no  
problem  <ARG1
,  
we  >>>ARG0
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
match  V01
the  
offer  V01
or  
do  V02
better  <ARGM-MNR
.  
"  

Mr.  >ARG0
Guerra  
gave  V01
me  <ARG2
a  
better  >ARGM-ADJ
deal  V01
without  
any  
hassles  V02
nor  
any  
type  
of  
problems  
.  

Brickell  
Honda  >>ARG1
has  V01
been  V01
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
buying  >ARG1
experience  V01
in  
the  
world  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>>ARG0
urge  V01
all  
St.  
Thomas  
the  
Apostle  
parishioners  <ARG1
and  
all  
of  
South  
Florida  
residents

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
,  
Honest  >ARGM-MNR
Service  V02

I  >>ARG0
took  V01
my  
2001  
Nissan  
Frontier  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
to  
fix  V02
a  
cracked  
manifold  <ARG1
.  

The  
dealer  >ARG0
wanted  V01
$  >ARGM-ADV
1300  
to  
fix  V02
that  <ARG1
and  
another  
$  >ARGM-ADV
1500  
to  
fix  V02
some  
other  
things  <ARG1
.  

Eagle  
Transmission  >ARG0
determined  V01
that  
much  >>>ARG1
of  
the  
work  V01
the  
dealer  >ARG0
said  V01
needed  V01
to  
be  V03
done  V02
was  V01
unneccesary  <ARG2
and  
what  >>>ARG1
needed  V01
to  
be  V03
fixed  V02
was  V01
only  
$  <ARG2
400  
!!  

I  >>ARG1
was  V01
so  >ARGM-EXT
impressed  V01
with  
the  
honesty  <ARG0
and  
integrity  
of  
Mike  
and  
everyone  
at  
Eagle  
Transmission  
!  

I  >ARG0
dropped  V03
the  
truck  <ARG1
off  <C-V
in  
the  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
and  
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
ready  V02
that  
afternoon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
finally  >ARGM-TMP
found  V01
a  
mechanic  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
trust  V02
!!  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
it  
was  V01
great  V01
that  
they  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
charge  V01
a  
service  
fee  <ARG1
to  
diagnose  V01
the  
problem  <ARG2
-  
an  
added  
bonus

Dr.

Dr.  >ARG1

After  
the

she  >ARG0
spoke  V01
to  
me  <ARG2
on  
my  >ARG0
last  >ARGM-TMP
visit  V01

I  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD

Good  
luck  
keeping  V01

that

You  >>ARG3

someone  <ARGM-GOL

it  >>>ARG1

not  
going  V04

Dr.  >ARG1
Shady  
is  V01
inexperienced  <ARG2

prideful

She  >>ARG0
probably  >>ARGM-ADV

10

some

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD

carefully  >ARGM-MNR
researching  V01

I  >>>ARG0
did  V01
not  >>ARGM-NEG
have  VLV
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
w  
/  
Dr.  <ARG1
Ghassemlou  
.  

During  
the  
session  V01
,  
he  >>ARG0
demanded  V01
to  
have  V03
my  
physical  
address  >>>ARG1
,  
which  >>>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
kept  V02
private  V02
as  
I  >>ARG1
am  V03
enrolled  V01
in  
a

protection  V01
program  <<ARG2

I  >ARG0
believe  V01
he  >>ARG1
is  V01
correct  V02
in  
that  
he  >ARG0
needs  V01
my  
physical  
address  <ARG1
for  
legal  
reasons  <ARGM-PRP

however  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
adequately  >ARGM-MNR
explain  V01
this  <ARG1
during  
our  >ARG0
session  V01

I  >ARG0
learned  V01
more  <ARG1
about  
this  
doing  VLV
my  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-ADJ
research  V01
afterward  
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
he  >>>ARG0

more  <ARG1
to  
assuage  V01
my  >ARG1
concerns  V01
by  
giving  V01
me  <ARG2
concrete  
facts  <ARG1
.  

Saying  V01
that  
I  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
give  V01
him  <ARG2
my  
address  <ARG1
or  
else  
I  >>ARG1
have  VLV
intimacy  >ARG0
issues  V02
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
helpful  V04
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
pretty  
combative  <ARG2
actually  <ARGM-ADV
.  

you  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
love  V01
it  <ARG1

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
had  V04
my  
back  >ARG1
fused  V01
in  
2  
places  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
wish  V01
that  
I  >>ARG0
had  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
done  V02
this  <ARG1
.  

With  
these  
fusions  V01
,  
chiropractric  >>ARG1
is  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
as  >ARGM-EXT
successful  V01
,  
but  
it  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-ADV
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful  V04
.  

Even  
after  
my  >ARG1
fusions  V01
,  
my  
back  >>ARG1
continued  V01
to  
hurt  V02
,  
but  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hurt  V02
any  
more  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
encourage  V01
anyone  >>>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
is  V03
thinking  V01
of  
back  
surgery  <ARG1
,  
to  
talk  V01
about  
different  
treatment  
options  <ARG1
first  <ARGM-TMP
with  
Dr.  <ARG2
de  
Barros  
.  

He  >>>ARG0
really  >>>ARGM-ADV
knows  V01
what  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
is  V03
talking  V01
about  <C-ARG1
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
approach  V02
the  
different  
options  <ARG1
fairly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
different  >ARGM-ADJ
treatments  V03
that  >R-ARG1
a  
surgeon  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see  V01
,  
so  
that  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
several  
treatment  
options  <ARG1
before  
you  >ARG0
decide  V01
what  >ARG1
to  
do  V02
.  

Unbelievably  
huge  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
for  
such  
a  
small  
salon  <ARGM-ADJ
!!!  

I  >>ARG1
have  V01
been  V01
to  
Kim  <ARG2
at  
Cheveux  
for  
more  
than  
five  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
tell  V01
you  <ARG2
how  
often  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG1
am  V03
complimented  V01
on  
my  
hair  <ARG2
(  
style  
AND  
color  
)  
!  

I  >ARG0
regularly  >ARGM-TMP
request  V01
Kim  
's  
business  
cards  <ARG1
as  
I  >>>ARG2
am  V03
often  >>ARGM-TMP
stopped  V01
on  
the  
street  <ARGM-LOC
and  
asked  V01
"  
Who  >ARG0
does  V02
your  
hair  <ARG1

I  >ARG0
LOVE  V01
it  <ARG1
!!!  
"  

Quaint  
,  
lovely

small  
salon  
with  
BIG  
personality  
.  

I  >>>ARG1
am  V03
made  V02
to  
feel  V01
special  V02
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
am  V01
in  
the  
chair  <ARG2
and  
I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
NEVER  >>>ARGM-NEG
had  VLV
a  
less  
than  
amazing  >>ARGM-ADJ
cut  V01
or  
color  
experience  V01
.  

My  
hair  >>>ARG2
has  V01
never  >>ARGM-NEG
felt  V05
this  
healthy  V01
,  
either  <ARGM-DIS
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
recommend  V01
this  
salon  <ARG1
enough  <ARGM-EXT
!!!  

Thanks  V01

My  
Favorite  
in  
McLean  

My  
family  >>ARG1
loves  V01
coming  V01
to  
Endo  
Sushi  <ARG4
.  
They  >>ARG1
are  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
nice  V01
,  
it  >>ARG1
is  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
crowded  V01
,  
and  
the  
food  >>>ARG1
is  V01
wonderful  V03
,  
very  >ARGM-EXT
delicious  V01
and  
fresh  V04
!  

Sometimes  >>ARGM-TMP
it  
is  V01
hard  V02
to  
get  V01
parking  V01
in  
the  
lot  <<ARGM-LOC
in  
front  
of  
the  
storefront  
,  
and  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
on  
a  
one  
-  
way  V01
street  <<ARG2
,  
but  
the  
restaurant  >>ARG1
itself  
is  V01
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
overcrowded  V01
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
park  V01
in  
the  
lot  <ARG2
,  
then  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
park  V01
in  
the  
shopping  
center  
's  
garage  <ARG2
,  
and  
walk  V01
up  <ARG2
to  
Endo  
Sushi  <ARG2
.  

The  
service  V02
is  V01
fast  V02
.  

Be  V01
sure  V01
to  
ring  V01
the  
little  
bell  <ARG1
on  
your  >ARG0
way  V01
out  <ARG1
if  
you  >ARG0
enjoyed  V01
your  
meal  <ARG1
!  

(  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
by  
the  
door  <ARG2
,  
on  
the  
hostess  
stand  
)  

Horrible  >ARGM-ADJ
Service  V02
!  

I  >>>ARG2
got  V03
yelled  V01
at  <C-ARG2
,  
literally  >ARGM-ADV
yelled  V01
at  <C-ARG2
because  
i  >ARG0
asked  V01
if  
i  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
pick  V04
up  
my  
car  <ARG1
5  
-  
10  
minutes  
late  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
explained  V01
that  
i  >ARG1
was  V01
already  <ARGM-TMP
on  
my  >ARG0
way  V01
and  
i  >>ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
rush  V01
to  
get  V05
there  <ARG2
as  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
as  
i  
could  
because  
i  >ARG0
needed  V01
my  
car  <ARG1
for  
work  V01
at  
5  
am  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
the  
guy  >>>ARG0
was  V03
arguing  V02
with  
me  <ARG1
saying  V01
he  >>>ARG0
was  V03
gon  V04
na  
lock  V01
the  
doors  <ARG1
right  
at  
5:30  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Rude  
,  
unprofessional  
,  
just  
jerks  
.  

Seems  V01
like  
all  >>ARG1
they  >ARG0
care  V01
about  <C-ARG1
is  V01
the  
money  <ARG2
and  
getting  V05
home  <ARG2
on  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
NO  >ARGM-NEG
care  V01
for  
the  
customers  <ARG1
AT  
ALL  <ARGM-EXT
!!!  

Missed  V02
a  
whole  
day  <ARG1
of  
work  V01
because  
i  >ARG1
am  V01
now  <ARGM-TMP
carless  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
to  
this  
place  <ARG4
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Superb  >ARGM-ADJ
Arrangements  V01

I  >ARG0
used  V01
Fancy  
Flowers  <ARG1
for  
my  
late  
husband  
's  
funeral  
flowers  <ARG2
as  
they  >>>ARG1
had  V01
been  V03
recommended  V01
to  
me  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG1
am  V01
so  >ARGM-EXT
glad  V02
that  
I  >>ARG0
called  V04
in  
to  
see  V01
Ana  <ARG1
,  
she  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
lovely  
girl  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
showed  V01
nothing  <ARG1
but  
care  V03
and  
compassion  V01
towards  
me  <ARG1
.  

The  
flowers  >ARG1
were  V01
all  >>ARG2
that  >>R-ARG2
I  >ARG0
hoped  V01
they  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
,  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
attended  V01
several  
funerals  <ARG1
of  
late  <ARGM-TMP
unfortunately  <ARGM-ADV
and  
the  
flowers  >>ARG0
I  >ARG0
recieved  V01
from  
Ana  <ARG2
outshone  V01
them  <ARG1
all  
.  

She  >ARG1
is  V01
so  
talented  <ARG2
,  
the  
flowers  >>ARG1
were  V03
arranged  V01
superbly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
delicately  
,  
it  
is  V01
so  >ARGM-EXT
obvious  V01
to  
see  V01
the  
difference  V02
between  
someone  <ARG1
fully  
trained  
and  
skilled  
compared  
to  
others  
.  

Thank  V01
you  <ARG1
Ana  <ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
hope  V01
to  
see  V01
you  <ARG1
in  
the  
future  <ARGM-TMP
under  
better  
circumstances  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
first  >ARGM-TMP
experience  V01
.  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01
22  <ARG2
,  
and  
my  
hairdresser  >>>ARG1
was  V01
great  V01
(  
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
"  
old  V01
"  
like  
one  >>ARG0
of  
the  
reviews  V01
says  V01
)  
-  
she  >>>ARG0
really  >>>ARGM-ADV
listened  V01
to  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
wanted  V01
and  
gave  V01
me  <ARG2
tons  <ARG1
of  
tips  V05
on  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
style  V01
my  
hair  <ARG1
so  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
get  V04
it  >ARG0
to  
look  V02
the  
way  V01
I  >ARG0
wanted  V01
it  <ARG1
to  <ARG1
.  

She  >>ARG0
deep  >ARGM-EXT
conditioned  V02
my  
hair  <ARG1
and  
took  V01
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
style  V01
it  <ARG1
properly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

She  >>>ARG0
recommended  V01
products  <ARG1
but  
absolutely  >>ARGM-ADV
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
pressure  V01
me  >ARG0
to  
buy  V01
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
cute  
place  <ARG2
with  
a  
really  
friendly  
,  
laid  
-  
back  
atmosphere  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
it  <ARG1
and  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
going  V02
back  <ARG4
for  
my  
next  
haircut  <ARGM-PRP
.  

Oh  
!  

And  
students  >ARG0
get  V01
$  <ARG1
5  
off  <ARG1
,  
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
argue  V02
with  
that  <ARG2
.  

Smoker  
s  
Haven  

Yeah  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
this  
complex  >>ARG1
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
very  >ARGM-EXT
good  V02
.  

Our  
bathroom  
fan  >>>ARG1
,  
one  
electric  
outlet  
and  
2  
leaky  
sinks  
have  V11
yet  <ARG1
to  
be  V03
fixed  V02
.  

Both  
bathrooms  >ARG0
look  V02
like  
they  >>ARG1
were  V03
flooded  V01
and  
the  
wood  
cabinets  >>ARG1
are  V03
thrashed  V01
at  
the  
bottom  <ARGM-LOC
and  
they  >>>ARG0
slapped  V01
some  
pieces  <ARG2
of  
wood  
over  <ARGM-PRD
to  
try  V01
to  
cover  V04
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
non-smokers  >ARGM-DIS
beware  V01
!!!  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
90  
percent  >ARG1
of  
the  
tenants  
are  V01
smokers  <ARG2
!  

If  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
smoke  V02
,  
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
move  V01
here  <ARG2
.  

Our  
unit  >ARG0
reeks  V01
of  
old  
cigarette  
smoke  <ARG1
and  
it  >>>ARG1
started  V01
to  
become  V01
apparent  V02
a  
few  
weeks  
after  
we  >ARG1
moved  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
.  

You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
walk  V01
5  
feet  <ARG2
without  
smelling  V01
that  
disgusting  
cigarette  
smoke  <ARG1
and  
it  >ARG1
blows  V04
right  
into  
the  
windows  <ARGM-DIR
all  
day  <ARGM-TMP
and  
all  
night  
.  

Great  
Sanwiches  
,  
Great  >ARGM-ADJ
Prices  V01

I  >>>ARG0
used  V03
to  
go  V02
here  <ARG4
almost  
every  
day  <ARGM-TMP
since  
I  >ARG0
work  V01
in  
the  
neighbourhood  <ARGM-LOC
and  
loved  V01
their  
turkey  
and  
meatball  
sandwiches  <ARG1
.  

Chicken  
salad  
salad  >>ARG1
is  V01
great  V01
too  <ARGM-DIS
.  

Best  >>>ARGM-ADV
of  
all  
,  
the  
staff  >>>ARG0
is  V01
quick  V02
on  
their  
feet  <ARGM-MNR
and  
even  
with  
long  
lines  
,  
usually  >ARGM-TMP
serve  V02
you  <ARG2
in  
5  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
or  
less  
.  

For  
the  
quality  
,  
the  
prices  V01
(  
$  <ARG2
4  
-  
$  
6  
)  
have  V02
to  
be  V01
the  
best  <ARG2
in  
town  
.  

The  
staff  >>>ARG0
get  V04
to  
know  V02
regulars  <ARG1
and  
do  V02
their  
job  <ARG1
very  
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Tourists  >ARG0
like  
the  
other  
reviewer  
might  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
appreciate  V02
their  
efficiency  <ARG1
or  
quality  
,  
but  
I  
certainly  
do  V01
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
a  
TGIF  <ARG2
or  
Cafe  
,  
it  >ARG1
s  V01
a  
lunch  
sandwich  
place  <ARG2
and  
a  
good  
one  
at  
that  
.  

Rate  V01
a  
church  <ARG1
?  

Might  >>ARGM-MOD
as  >>ARGM-ADV
well  
just  >ARGM-ADV
hotpot  V02
the  
curb  <ARG1
and  
rate  V01
the  
traffic  
light  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
bloody  
church  <ARG2
,  
for  
chrisssake  <ARGM-DIS
!  

Big  
,  
grey  
and  
imposing  
.  

Go  V02
there  <ARG4
on  
christian  >ARGM-ADJ
holidays  V01
for  
a  
bit  <<ARGM-PRP
of  
churchy  
grandure  
.  

The  
pastor  >>ARG1
at  
this  
church  
is  V01
cool  V04
,  
I  >ARG0
met  V02
him  <ARG1
after  
some  
holiday  >ARGM-TMP
service  V01
.  

He  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
robe  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
was  V03
made  V01
back  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
'60s  
.  

God  >>ARG1
was  V01
pleased  V01
with  
that  
one  <ARG0
!  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
historical  <ARG2
for  
Sf  <ARGM-GOL
,  
so  >>>ARGM-ADV
when  >ARGM-TMP
your  
aunte  >ARG1
comes  V01
for  
a  
visit  V01
,  
take  V01
her  <ARG1
there  <ARG3
.  

Great  
for  
the  
kiddies  
-  
they  >ARG0
love  V01
the  
labyrinth  <ARG1
(  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
forget  V01
to  
tell  V01
'em  <ARG2
it  >ARG1
s  V01
really  <ARGM-ADV
a

)  
.  

Stop  V02

at

once  <ARGM-TMP
or  
you  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
go  V02
to

ok  >ARGM-ADJ
stay  V01
even  
tho  
the  
manager  >ARG0
looked  V02
like  
he  >ARG1
was  V01
chineze  <ARG2
and  
that  
we  >>>ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
slept  V01
and  
went  V02
out  <ARGM-DIR
from  
8  <ARGM-TMP
to  
7  
to  
see  V01
New  
York  <ARG1
.  

but  
sice  
we  >ARG0
almost  >ARGM-ADV
just  >ARGM-ADV
slept  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
i  
ca  
nt  
give  VLV
that  
good  
of  
a  
review  V01

It  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
Saturday  <ARG2
and  
my  
spring  >ARG1
was  V01
broken  <ARG2
...  

I  >>>ARG0
googled  V01
Garage  >ARG1
Door  >ARG1
Repair  V01
in  
Woodinville  <ARGM-LOC
and  
found  V01
NDI  <ARG1
-  
Johnette  >>>ARG0
answered  V01
the  
phone  <ARG1
and  
was  V01
oh  
-  
so  >ARGM-EXT
pleasant  V02
and  
helpful  V04
!  

She  >ARG0
sort  
of  >ARGM-ADV
appologized  V01
for  
Dan  >>>ARG0
taking  V18
the  
day  <ARG1
off  <C-V
to  
go  V05
skiing  V01
-  
but  
he  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
the  
repair  V01
on  
Sunday  <<ARGM-TMP
!  

I  >ARG0
said  V01
great  <ARG1
and  
Dan  >>>ARG0
arrived  V01
on  
time  <ARGM-TMP
at  
10  
am  <ARGM-TMP
to  
make  VLV
the  
repair  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG0
enjoyed  V01
speaking  V01
with  
Dan  <ARG2
,  
and  
learning  V01
more  <ARG1
about  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
the  
springs  >>ARG1
are  V03
sized  V01
for  
these  
doors  <ARGM-GOL
.  

The  
repair  V01
went  V06
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
the  
price  V01
was  V01
extremely  >ARGM-ADV
fair  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
NDI  <ARG1
-  
and  
will  >ARGM-MOD
spread  V03
the  
word  <ARG1
to  
my  
neighbors  <ARGM-GOL
.  

Thanks  V01
Dan  <ARGM-DIS
and  
Johnette  
for  
your  
responsiveness  <ARG2
and  
professional  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V01
.  

Roger  
M.  
,  
Woodinville  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
send  V01
my  
dogs  <ARG1
there  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
had  VLV
a  
conversation  V01
with  
the  
woman  >ARG0
running  V01
this  
place  <ARG1
in  
April  <<ARGM-TMP
2010  
.  

She  >ARG0
basically  >ARGM-ADV
said  V01
if  
the  
children  >>>ARG0
getting  V05
off  
the  
bus  <ARGM-DIR
are  V03
n't  >ARGM-NEG
paying  V01
to  
enter  V01
her  
building  <ARG1
she  >>>ARG0
was  V03
going  V04
to  
let  V01
them  >ARG0
wander  V01
around  
the  
streets  <ARG1
.  

Wow  
,  
really  
?  

With  
all  
the  
child  
predators  
out  
there  
,  
a  
busy  
road  
,  
cars  >ARG1
speeding  V01
by  <ARGM-DIR
......  
and  
you  >>>ARG0
are  V03
going  V04
to  
let  V01
some  
4  
/  
5  
year  
olds  >ARG0
wonder  V01
around  <ARG1
cause  
you  >>ARG0
're  V01
money  >ARG1
hungry  V01
?  

REAL  
CHRISTIAN  
OF  
YOU  
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

Whether  
they  >ARG0
pay  V01
me  <ARG2
or  
not  
,  
if  
their  
parents  >ARG0
get  V04
into  
an  
accident  <ARG1
,  
stuck  
in  
traffic  
,  
etc.  
THE  
LAST  
THING  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
WOULD  >ARGM-MOD
DO  V02
IS  V01
LET  V01
A  
CHILD  >>ARG1
GET  V03
RAPED  V01
BECAUSE  
I  >>ARG2
WAS  V03
N'T  >ARGM-NEG
PAID  V01
.  

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02

I  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
easily  >>ARGM-MNR
go  V02
to  
Nordstrom  <ARG4
for  
my  
designer  
jeans  <ARGM-PRP
and  
pay  V01
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
price  V01
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
go  V02
to  
the  
Garment  
District  <ARG4
for  
their  >ARG0
service  V02
.  

Previous  
reviewers  >ARG0
said  V01
they  >ARG1
were  V01
pushy  <ARG2
and  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
understand  V01
that  <ARG1
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
find  V02
the  
staff  >ARG0
more  >ARGM-CXN
helpful  V04
than  
anything  <ARGM-CXN
else  
.  

Tiffany  >>ARG1
is  V01
fabulous  V01
!  

I  >>>ARG0
came  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
for  
alterations  V01
(  
free  
,  
by  
the  
way  V01
)  
and  
told  V01
her  <ARG2
about  
a  
stain  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
had  V03
on  
my  
new  
leather  
purse  <ARGM-LOC
.  

She  >>>ARG0
immediately  >>>ARGM-TMP
went  V02
to  
the  
back  <ARG4
,  
brought  V01
out  <ARG3
leather  
cleaner  <ARG1
and  
cleaned  V01
my  
purse  <ARG1
on  
the  
spot  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
buy  V01
the  
bag  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
!  

Huge  >ARGM-EXT
selection  V01
and  
,  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
suggestions  V01
from  
the  
staff  <ARG0
and  
they  >ARG0
refer  V02
you  <ARG1
to  
reliable  
places  <ARG2
if  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
need  V01
.  

We  >>ARG0
were  V03
expecting  V01
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
recieved  V01
a  
friendly  >ARGM-ADJ
greeting  V01
by  
the  
hosts  <ARG0
.  

The  
atmosphere  >>>ARG1
was  V01
nice  V01
and  
very  >ARGM-EXT
clean  V04
.  

The  
menu  >ARG0
had  V03
plenty  <ARG1
of  
options  
even  
for  
picky  
eaters  <ARGM-GOL
.  

The  
service  V02
was  V01
ok  <ARG2
,  
our  
waitress  >>ARG0
kept  V02
forgetting  V01
our  
drinks  <ARG1
even  
though  
we  >ARG0
reminded  V01
her  <ARG2
several  
times  <ARGM-TMP
.  

To  
start  V01
we  >ARG0
tried  V01
the  
guacamole  <ARG1
and  
salsa  
verde  
,  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
completly  
flavorless  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
left  V11
then  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >ARG0
orderd  V02
our  
meals  <ARG1
anyway  <ARGM-ADV
,  
chimichangas  
,  
jalapeno  
borritos  
,  
and  
quesadillas  
.  

Everything  >ARG1
was  V01
bland  <ARG2
,  
completely  
void  
of  
any  
spice  
or  
flavor  
.  

We  >>ARG0
have  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
had  V03
mexican  
food  <ARG1
this  
bad  
,  
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
simply  >ARGM-ADV
gross  V05
.  

Hopefully  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG0
spice  V01
things  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-PRD
or  
they  >ARG1
wo  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
in  
business  <ARG2
long  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
recommend  V01
La  
Hacienda  <ARG1

Might  >ARGM-MOD
try  V01
again  <ARGM-TMP

Pros  
:  
*  
Jill  >>>ARG0
,  
the  
owner  
,  
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
nice  V01
and  
really  >ARGM-ADV
cares  V01
about  
her  
feedback  <ARG1
*  
Pretty  
nice  
atmosphere  
*  
Great  
Dessert  
*  
Not  >ARGM-NEG
your  >ARG0
typical  >ARGM-ADJ
veggie  >ARG1
selection  V01
,  
I  >ARG0
like  V01
!  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
where  >ARGM-LOC
else  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
find  V01
Purple  
Hull  
Peas  <ARG1
and  
some  
of  
the  
other  
sides  
.  

Cons  
:  
*  
Server  >>ARG1
was  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
very  >ARGM-EXT
pleasant  V02
*  
Pretty  
small  
portion  
on  
the  
blackened  
catfish  
*  
Overcooked  V01
food  <ARG1
*  
Time  
,  
took  V10
about  
25  
minutes  <ARG1
from  
ordering  V02
to  
eating  V01
.  

Half  
the  
tables  >ARG1
and  
bar  
were  V01
empty  <ARG2
by  
this  
point  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Other  >ARGM-ADJ
Thoughts  V01
:  
Will  >ARGM-MOD
try  V01
this  
place  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

There  
must  >ARGM-MOD
be  V02
a  
reason  >ARGM-CAU
so  
many  
people  >ARG0
like  V01
it  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Their  
Club  
sandwich  >ARG0
looks  V02
tasty  <ARG1
,  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
change  V01
my  
mind  <ARG1
....  
and  
a  
different  
server  <C-ARG0
.  

very  
professional  
/  
very  
helpful  

the  
people  >>>ARG0
at  
Fidelity  
Leasing  
were  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
friendly  V01
and  
helpful  V04
.  

i  >>>ARG0
was  V03
looking  V01
for  
a  
car  <ARG1
but  
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-ADV
know  V01
what  >ARG1
i  >ARG0
wanted  V01
and  
they  >>>ARG0
were  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful  V04
and  
took  V01
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
first  >ARGM-TMP
figure  V05
out  
what  >>ARG2
my  >ARG0
needs  V01
were  V01
and  
showing  V01
me  <ARG2
various  
options  <ARG1
to  
meet  V01
those  
needs  V01
.  

they  >>ARG1
seemed  V01
more  >ARGM-EXT
interested  V01
in  
helping  V01
me  >ARG0
find  V01
the  
right  
car  <ARG1
rather  
then  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
make  VLV
a  
sale  V01
.  

my  >ARG0
experience  V01
with  
them  <ARG1
was  V01
great  V01
-  
low  
stress  
,  
very  
helpful  
and  
very  
personal  
.  

after  
finding  V01
the  
car  <ARG1
i  >ARG0
wanted  V01
they  >ARG0
took  V01
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
go  V26
over  V_
each  
step  V01
and  
making  V02
it  >ARG0
as  >ARGM-CXN
painless  V01
as  
possible  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

from  
start  V01
to  
finish  V02
they  >ARG1
were  V01
top  
notch  <ARG2
.  

i  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
calling  V08
these  
people  <ARG1
up  <C-V
for  
your  
next  
car  <ARGM-PRP
.  

This  
insurance  
co.  >ARG1
Is  V01
a  
joke  V01
!!!  

They  >ARG0
have  V03
absolutely  
no  
communication  
skills  <ARG1
whatsoever  
.  

if  
you  >>>ARG2
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
mind  V01
being  V03
robbed  V01
,  
cheated  V01
or  
lied  V08
to  <C-ARG2
then  >ARGM-ADV
this  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
company  <ARG2
for  
you  
.  

They  >>>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
make  VLV
every  
attempt  V01
to  
misinform  V01
and  
misrepresent  V01
themselves  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
make  V10
up  
excuses  V02
in  
hopes  V01
to  
confuse  V01
their  
policy  
holders  <ARG1
with  
misinformation  V01
.  

as  
an  
example  >>>ARGM-ADV
they  >>>ARG0
took  V01
payment  V01
for  
5  
out  
of  
6  
monthly  
plan  
premiums  <ARG3
for  
a  
yearly  
policy  <ARG3
and  
cancelled  V01
the  
contract  <ARG1
for  
the  
remainder  
of  
the  
policy  
for  
reasons  >>>ARG0
they  >ARG0
stated  V01
was  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
receiving  V01
information  <ARG1
on  
other  
licensed  
drivers  
in  
the  
household  
?  

I  >ARG0
personally  >ARGM-MNR
provided  V01
the  
request  V01
on  
four  
separate  >ARGM-ADJ
occasions  V02
and  
they  >ARG0
claim  V01
there  
is  V02
a  
glitch  <ARG1
in  
their  
systems  
?  

Ifa  >ARG1
is  V01
an  
acronym  <ARG2
for  
I  >ARG1
m  V01
a  
F%#king  
Assh@%$e  <ARG2
!!!  

Fantastic  >ARGM-ADJ
Service  V02
!  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V01
here  <ARG2
a  
few  
times  <ARGM-TMP
for  
oil  >ARG1
changes  V01
and  
just  >ARGM-TMP
got  V04
my  
tires  >>>ARG1
,  
alignment  V01
and  
state  >ARG0
inspection  V01
done  V08
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
shopped  V01
it  <ARG1
around  <ARGM-ADV
and  
they  >>>ARG0
were  V01
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
competitive  V02
in  
pricing  V01
and  
also  >ARGM-ADV
added  V02
nitrogen  <ARG1
to  
my  
tires  <ARG2
which  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
extend  V01
the  
life  <ARG1
and  
get  V01
me  <ARG4
better  
gas  
mileage  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
also  >ARGM-DIS
came  V05
with  
free  
balance  <ARGM-MNR
and  
rotation  V01
for  
the  
life  <ARG1
of  
the  
tires  
!  

What  >ARG0
made  V02
it  >ARG1
perfect  V02
was  V01
that  
they  >ARG0
offered  V01
transportation  V01
so  
that  
I  >>>ARG0
would  
not  
have  V02
to  
wait  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
or  
take  V18
time  <ARG1
off  <C-V
of  
work  V01
to  
go  V02
back  <ARG1
and  
forth  
or  
try  V01
to  
find  V01
a  
ride  V01
.  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02
,  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
pricing  V01
and  
SUPER  
CONVENIENT  
!  

I  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-DIS
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
feel  V01
like  
they  >>ARG0
tried  V01
to  
sell  V01
me  <ARG2
a  
bunch  <ARG1
of  
services  V01
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
need  V01
.  

Love  V01
my  
home  <ARG1
at  
Creekside  

I  >>>ARG0
moved  V01
to  
Creekside  
Apartments  <ARG2
in  
August  <ARGM-TMP
2008  
with  
a  
6  
-  
month  
lease  <ARGM-MNR
and  
have  V01
just  >ARGM-TMP
extended  V01
it  <ARG1
for  
another  
13  
months  <ARG2
!  

The  
management  V01
from  
Julie  <ARGM-ADJ
and  
Janice  
to  
the  
work  
staff  <ARGM-ADJ
,  
esp.  
Edwin  
,  
are  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
wonderful  V03
.  

They  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V01
extremely  >ARGM-ADV
helpful  V04
whenever  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
asked  V02
for  
help  V01
.  

Although  
the  
apartments  >>ARG0
are  V01
facing  V01
Stokes  
Street  <ARG1
and  
close  
to  
the  
Bascom  
Light  
Rail  
,  
the  
location  >>ARG1
is  V01
surprisingly  >ARGM-MNR
quiet  V04
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
had  V03
any  
problems  <ARG1
with  
loud  
neighbors  
or  
concerns  V01
about  
safety  <ARG0
.  

The  
apartments  >ARG1
are  V01
within  
walking  
distance  <ARG2
to  
Trader

Whole

The

Not

did  
I  >>ARG1
feel  V01
listened  V01
to  <C-ARG1
like  
they  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
cared  V01
about  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
wanted  V01

all  >>>ARG1

me  >ARG0
signing  V02
a

there

Very  
high

sales  V01
and  
with  
the  
reviews  V01
of  
many  
others  <ARG0
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02

I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
glad  V02
I  >>>ARG1
trusted  V02
my  
gut  <ARG1
and  
did  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
get  V03
sucked  V01
into  
doing  V02
business  <ARG1
with  
them

Find  V01
someone  >>>ARG0

trust  V02
that  >>>R-ARG0
actually  >>ARGM-ADV
hears  V01
you  <ARG2
and  
wants  V01
to  
do  V02
the

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
waste  V01
your  
time  <ARG1

money  
!  

I  >ARG0
took  V01
my  
3  
year  
old  
son  <ARG1
here  <ARG3
at  
the  
weekend  <ARGM-TMP
and  
to  
be  V01
honest  V01
,  
apart  >ARGM-ADV
from  
the  
shark  
walkway  
,  
I  >ARG0
thought  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
rubbish  <ARG2
and  
overpriced  
.  

Even  
taking  VLV
into  
account  V01
the  
fact  
that  
my  
3  
year  
old  >>ARG0
wanted  V01
to  
run  V02
most  <ARG1
of  
the  
way  V01
round  <<ARGM-DIR
,  
it  >ARG0
took  V10
us  <ARG2
just  
over  
one  
hour  <ARG1
start  V01
to  
finish  V02
.  

If  
you  >>ARG1
have  V01
been  V01
to  
the  
London  
Aquarium  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
bother  V02
with  
this  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >>>ARG0
are  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
desperate  V01
for  
something  >ARG0
to  
pass  V04
the  
time  <ARG1

are  V01
willing  V02

shell  V03
out  
the

part  <ARG1

£

for  
2  
two  
people  <ARG2

go  V03
for  
it  <ARG1

(  
For  
some  
reason  >ARGM-PRP
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
let  V01
me  >ARG0
rate  V01
it  <ARG1
one  
star  <ARG2

it  >>ARG1

Cranmore  
Dental

I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
recommend  V01
Dr  <ARG1
David  
Nelson  
enough  <ARGM-EXT
.  

I  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
severe  
phobia  <ARG1
of  
attending  V01
the  
dentist  <ARG1
until  
I  >>>ARG1
met  V02
and  
was  V03
treated  V03
by  <ARG0
Dr  <ARG0
Nelson  
.  

He  >ARG0
instantaneously  >ARGM-TMP
put  V03
me  <ARG1
at  
ease  <ARG2
and  
his  >ARG1
ongoing  >ARGM-TMP
treatments  V03
have  V01
been  V01
absolutely  >ARGM-ADV
pain  >ARG2
free  V04
.  

My  >ARG0
previous  >ARGM-TMP
apprehension  V02
has  V01
been  V03
dismissed  V02
and  
I  >>ARG0
no  
longer  >>ARGM-NEG
have  VLV
a  
sinking  >ARG1
feeling  V01
when  >>>ARGM-TMP
my  >ARG0
next  >ARGM-TMP
appointment  V02
is  V01
due  V03
!  

In  
addition  V02
to  
the  
core  >ARGM-ADJ
treatment  V03
,  
Dr  >>ARG0
Nelson  
has  V01
impressed  V01
me  <ARG1
further  <ARGM-EXT
with  
his  >>ARG1
concern  V01
and  
interest  V01
in  
the  
well  >ARGM-MNR
-  
being  V02
of  
his  
patients  <ARG1
–  
his  >ARG0
dental  >ARG1
work  V01
underpinned  V01
by  
a  
strong  
duty  <ARG0
of  
care  V03
to  
every  
patient  <ARG1
.  

He  >>>ARG0
is  V01
always  <ARGM-TMP
prepared  <ARG2
to  
go  V02
the  
extra  
mile  <ARG1
to  
ensure  V01
that  
any  
patient  
discomfort  >>ARG2
is  V03
dealt  V01

After  
my  
trees  >>ARG1
were  V03
cleaned  V02
up  
,  
they  >ARG0
gave  V01
me  <ARG2
a  
jar  <ARG1
of  
salsa  
.  

The  
owner  >ARG0
warned  V01
me  <ARG2
that  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
best  
salsa  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had  V03
,  
and  
he  >>ARG1
was  V01
right  V06
.  

No  >ARGM-NEG
joke  V01
!  

I  >>ARG0
hate  V01
to  
say  V01
check  V05
them  <ARG1
out  <C-V
just  
for  
the  
salsa  <ARGM-PRP
,  
but  
James  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
NEED  V01
another  
jar  <ARG1
badly  <ARGM-EXT
:)  
All  
kidding  V01
aside  
,  
they  >ARG1
are  V01
a  
very  
good  
company  <ARG2
,  
I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
hard  
time  <ARG1
giving  VLV
any  
service  
biz  
a  
5  
star  >ARGM-ADJ
review  V01
but  
they  >ARG1
came  V04
close  <ARG2
.  

Very  
affordable  
(  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
call  V01
it  >ARG1
cheap  V02
)  
and  
their  
trimmers  >>ARG1
were  V01
quick  V02
and  
courteous  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
got  V05
home  <ARG2
from  
work  V01
.  

And  
the  
salsa  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
be  V01
sure  V01
to  
ask  V02
for  
a  
jar  <ARG1
and  
have  V03
plenty  <ARG1
of

around  
,  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD

,  
Dr.  >>ARG1
Mann  
ai  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
so  >ARGM-EXT
great  V01

We  >ARG0
took  V01
our  
beloved  
kitty  <ARG1
to  
him  <ARG3
and  
it  >ARG1
came  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
dead  <ARGM-PRD
.  

We  >ARG0
live  V01
in  
the  
sub-division  <ARGM-LOC
around  
the  
corner  
and  
after  
it  >ARG1
happened  V01
and  
we  >ARG0
brought  V02
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
at  
some  
neighborhood  >ARG0
gatherings  V03
we  >ARG0
discovered  V01
that  
several  
people  >ARG0
from  
this  
neighborhood  
alone  
had  V04
pets  >>>ARG1
go  V01
to  
Dr.  <ARG4
Mann  
for  
surgical  >ARGM-ADJ
procedures  V01
and  
came  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
dead  <ARGM-PRD

If  
you  >ARG0
take  V01
him  <ARG1
here  <ARG3
for  
shots  V01
,  
no  >ARGM-NEG
big  >ARGM-ADJ
deal  V03
but  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
let  V01
this  
man  >ARG0
apply  V03
anesthetic  <ARG1
to  
my  
pet  <ARG2
ever  
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Oh  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
they  >>>ARG0
also  >>>ARGM-DIS
charged  V01
me  <ARG2
for  
the  
procedure  V01
(  
$  <<ARG1
250  
)  
AND  
had  V03
the  
audacity  <ARG1
to  
charge  V01
me  <ARG2
a  
$  
25  
'  
DISPOSAL  
'  
fee  <ARG1

They  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
itemized  V01
it  <ARG1
as  
a  
DISPOSAL  
fee  <ARGM-MNR
.  

AVOID  V01
AT  
ALL  
COSTS  <ARGM-MNR

One  
of  
the  
worst  
places  

This  
place  >ARG1
and  
its  
sister  
store  
Peking  
Garden  
are  V01
the  
worst  
places  >ARG3
to  
order  V02
from  <C-ARG3
.  

the  
food  >>ARG1
was  V01
horrible  <ARG2
not  >ARGM-NEG
cooked  V01
like  
it  
should  
be  V03
,  
they  >>>ARG0
got  V04
the  
order  V02
wrong  V04
on  
a  
number  <<<ARGM-TMP
of  
occasions  V02
,  
and  
once  >ARGM-TMP
forgot  V01
about  
my  >ARG0
order  V02
.  

i  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
call  V02
back  <ARGM-PRD
up  
there  <ARG1
two  
hours  
later  <ARGM-TMP
and  
the  
lady  >>>ARG0
(  
who  >>R-ARG1
claimed  V01
to  
be  V01
a  
manager  <ARG2
)  
said  V01
my  
food  >ARG1
was  V01
on  
the  
way  V01
,  
and  
she  >>>ARG0
did  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
offer  V01
to  
compensate  V01
me  <ARG2
in  
any  
kind  <ARGM-MNR
of  
way  V01
.  

i  >ARG1
waited  V01
another  
30  
mins  <ARGM-TMP
before  
receiving  V01
my  
food  <ARG1
and  
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
cold  V01
.  

in  
my  
opinon  >>ARGM-ADV
this  
place  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
shut  V05
down  
by  
the  
health  
inspector  <ARG0
,  
and  
anyone  >>>ARG0
who  >R-ARG1
is  V01
satisfied  <ARG2
with  
there  >ARG0
service  V02
and  
food  
has  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
eaten  V01
at  
a  
real  
asian  
restaurant  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Gone  V01
downhill  <ARGM-DIR
since  
change  V01
in  
ownership  V01

Sigh  
.  

I  >>ARG0
used  V03
to  
LOVE  V01
this  
place  <ARG1
.  

But  >>>ARGM-DIS
now  >>>ARGM-TMP
that  
they  >ARG1
are  V01
part  <ARG2
of  
a  
chain  
,  
service  V01
has  V01
slipped  V01
.  

I  >>ARG1
am  V03
waiting  V01
longer  <ARGM-ADV
at  
BNA  <ARGM-LOC
for  
my  
pickups  <ARG2
and  
last  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
parked  V01
with  
them  <ARGM-COM
,  
they  >ARG3
lost  V02
my  
car  
key  <ARG1
.  

Lucky  
I  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
spare  <ARG1
with  
me  <ARGM-COM
!  

To  
date  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>>ARG1
have  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
made  V02
good  V02
by  
either  
finding  V01
the  
key  <ARG1
or  
paying  V01
for  
a  
new  
one  <ARG3
.  

(  
These  
new  
car  
keys  >>ARG1
are  V01
EXPENSIVE  V02
to  
copy  V01
,  
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADV
go  V02
to  
WalMart  <ARG4

Go  V02
to  
the

for  
coupons  <ARGM-PRP

join  V04
the  
club  <ARG1

you  >ARG0

However  >>>ARGM-ADV

with

one

park  V01

BNA  <ARG2

Wife  >>ARG0
and  
I  
attempted  V01
to  
adopt  V01
a  
dog  <ARG1
and  
was  V01
nothing  <ARG2
but  
frustrating  
.  

We  >>ARG0
arrived  V01
Sunday  <ARGM-TMP
at  
about  
230  <ARGM-TMP
and  
found  V01
a  
do  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-EXT
liked  V01
.  

We  >>ARG2
were  V03
told  V01
that  
we  
could  <ARG1
n't  
today  
because  
they  >>ARG1
were  V03
closing  V01
soon  <ARGM-TMP

I  >>ARG0
called  V02
the  
next  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
to  
let  V01
then  >ARG0
know  V01
my  
wife  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
driving  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR

They  >ARG0
gave  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
run  V22
around  <<ARG1
and  
missing  
paperwork  
only  >ARGM-ADV
to  
call  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
to  
tell  V01
me  <ARG2
someone  >ARG0
else  
wanted  V01
her  <ARG1
and  
I  >>>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
to  
come  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR

put  V01
down  <ARG2
a  
deposit  V01

I  >>ARG0
work  V01
2  
hours  
away  <ARGM-LOC

offered  V01
my  
card  <ARG1
over  
the  
phone  <ARGM-MNR
.  

They  >ARG0
refused  V01
.  

Terrible  >ARGM-MNR
communication  V01
as  <ARGM-ADJ
well  
.  

At  
one  
point  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
told  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
dog  >>>ARG1
had  V01
been  V03
fixed  V02
,  
the  
next  
day  
it  
had  V01
n't

Huge  
ammount

time  
wasted

elevated

sales  V01
that  >R-ARG1
are  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
really  <ARGM-ADV
sales  V01
,  
mislabeled  
items  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
make  V02
the  
item  >ARG1
sound  V01
like  
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
deal  V01
when  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
is  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
,  
a  
bad  
attitude  
about  
return  
items  
,  
and  
on  
and  
on  
.  

With  
higher  >ARGM-ADJ
than  
average  
prices  V01
to  
boot  V02
!  

So  >>>ARGM-DIS
do  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
get  V03
taken  V23
in  
,  
keep  V02
your  
eyes  >ARG1
open  V01
if  
you  >>ARG0
choose  V01
to  
shop  V01
here  <ARG2
.  

On  
the  
other  
hand  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
Richmond  
Ukrops  
chain  >>ARG1
is  V03
known  V02
for  
its  >ARG0
charity  >ARGM-ADJ
work  V01
,  
its  >ARG0
community  >ARG0
action  V02
,  
and  
its  >ARG1
interest  V01
in  
the  
public  
welfare  <ARG2
.  

Never  
again  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
here  <ARG4
unless  
you  >>>ARG0
want  V01
to  
sit  V01
,  
order  V02
,  
eat  V01
and  
be  V03
asked  V02
to  
leave  V11
all  
in  
a  
matter  <ARGM-TMP
of  
20  
minutes  
.  

You  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
have  V03
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
read  V01
the  
entire  
menu  <ARG1
before  
being  V03
asked  V02
to  
order  V02
and  
if  
you  >ARG0
ask  V02
for  
more  
time  <ARG1
your  
server  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
wait  V01
at  
the  
table  <ARGM-LOC
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
only  
place  >>>ARGM-LOC
I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
ever  >>>ARGM-TMP
eaten  V01
and  
been  V03
told  V01
to  
leave  V11
because  
other  
people  >>ARG1
were  V03
waiting  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
told  V01
to  
take  V01
my  
coffee  <ARG1
to  
go  V02
if  
I  >>ARG0
wanted  V01
to  
finish  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

Oh  
,  
and  
their  
liquor  
license  >ARG1
was  V01
expired  <ARG2
so  
no  
Bloody  
Mary  
or  
Mimosas  
.  

Plus  
the  
drinks  >ARG1
are  V01
self  >ARG2
service  V02
,  
have  VLV
fun  V01
trying  V01
to  
negotiate  V01
the  
small  
cafeteria  
space  <ARG2
to  
get  V01
your  
coffee  <ARG1
,  
juice  
or  
water  
.  

Go  V02
next  
door  <ARGM-GOL
to  
the  
Ball  
Square  
Cafe  <ARG4
instead  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
guess  V01
you  >ARG0
get  V01
what  >ARG3
you  >ARG0
pay  V01
for  <C-ARG3
.  

I  >>ARG1
tried  V01
to  
stay  V01
here  <ARG3
for  
a  
few  
nights  <ARGM-TMP
with  
my  
girlfriend  <ARGM-COM
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
asked  V02
for  
a  
single  
queen  
bed  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG1
got  V05
there  <ARG2
,  
and  
we  >>ARG2
were  V03
treated  V02
to  
the  
free  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
upgrade  V01
"  
of  
a  
room  <ARG2
with  
two  
double  
beds  
.  

Since  
they  >ARG0
consider  V01
this  <ARG1
an  
upgrade  V02
,  
they  >>>ARG0
let  V01
their  
other  
rooms  >ARG1
fill  V02
up  
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
change  V01
our  
room  <ARG1
.  

Then  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG1
got  V03
put  V01
in  
a  
room  <ARG2
with  
a  
huge  
gap  
under  
the  
door  
....  
right  
next  
to  
the  
ice  
machine  
.  

We  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
hear  V01
every  
single  
thing  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
happened  V01
outside  <ARGM-LOC
like  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
inside  
our  
room  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
finally  >ARGM-TMP
found  V01
someone  >ARG0
at  
the  
desk  
who  >R-ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
speak  V01
English  <ARG1
,  
they  >ARG0
moved  V01
our  
room  <ARG1
,  
but  
we  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
receive  V01
the  
single  
queen  >>ARG1
we  >>ARG0
had  V01
"  
reserved  V01
"  

I  >>ARG1
was  V01
thoroughly  >ARGM-EXT
impressed  V01
!  

I  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
problem  <ARG1
with  
the  
tile  >ARG1
in  
my  
bathroom  
coming  V04
apart  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
called  V02
a  
few  
different  
businesses  <ARG1
in  
the  
area  
to  
get  V01
estimates  V01
,  
they  >ARG1
were  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
the  
cheapest  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
found  V01
but  
very  
reasonable  
.  

The  
best  
part  >ARG1
is  V01
I  >ARG0
got  V04
my  
whole  
bathroom  >ARG1
remodeled  V01
for  
about  >ARGM-ADV
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
price  V01
the  
other  
company's  >>ARG0
were  V03
quoting  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
to  
fix  V02
the  
shower  
tile  <ARG1
and  
fixtures  
.  

They  >ARG0
had  V04
the  
work  V01
done  VLV
in  
about  
half  
the  
time  >ARG3
quoted  V01
which  >ARG0
made  V02
me  >ARG1
and  
my  
wife  
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
happy  V01
.  

We  >>ARG0
have  V01
had  V03
nothing  <ARG1
but  
compliments  
on  
our  
bathroom  
when  >ARGM-TMP
guest  >ARG1
come  V01
over  <ARGM-DIR
-  
who  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
guessed  V01
that  
one  <ARG1
?  

Very  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
work  V01
and  
friendly  
guys  
too  
.  

Best  
money  >>ARG3
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
spent  V01
on  
remodeling  V01
ever  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
any  
one  >>>ARG0
considering  V02
home  >ARG1
repair  V01
to  
give  VLV
these  
guys  >ARG1
a  
call  V02
.  

New  
training  
Centre  >>ARG1
is  V01
excellent  V02

The  
Award  
Dance  
Centre  >>ARG1
has  V01
moved  V01
from  
its  
Holderness  
Road  
site  <ARGM-DIR
to  
a  
new  
complex  <ARG2
on  
Chamberlain  
Road  
Hull  
.  

The  
new  
Centre  >>>ARG0
has  V03
4  
studios  >ARG1
planned  V01
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
boasts  V01
the  
largest  
single  
dance  
floor  
area  <ARG1
in  
Kingston  
upon  
Hull  
.  

The  
classes  >ARG0
cover  V02
all  
age  
and  
skill  
ranges  <ARG1
,  
with  
BALLROOM  <ARG2
,  
LATIN  
,  
SEQUENCE  
,  
STREET  
,  
DISCO  
,  
LINE  >ARG1
DANCING  V01
,  
BALLET  V01
,  
TAP  
&  
JAZZ  
.  

We  >>>ARG0
have  V01
attended  V01
A  
Ward  
Dance  
Centre  <ARG1
for  
over  
a  
year  <ARGM-TMP
and  
really  >ARGM-EXT
enjoy  V01
the  
friendly  >ARGM-MNR
and  
welcoming  
way  V01
we  >>ARG2
are  V03
taught  V01
Ballroom  <ARG1
and  
Latin  
as  
well  
as  
the  
fun  
filled  
social  >ARGM-ADJ
dance  V01
evening  >ARG1
held  V04
every  
Saturday  
evening  <ARGM-TMP
....  

It  
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-ADV
possible  V01
to  
score  V01
this  
school  <ARG1
too  
highly  <ARGM-MNR
,  
We  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
it  <ARG2
12  <ARG1
out  
of  
10  
and  
5  
Stars  
across  
the  
board  
Steve  
&  
Anne  

I  >ARG0
purchased  V01
a  
2  
-  
year  
old  
certified  
pre-owned  
BMW  <ARG1
from  
this  
dealership  <ARG2
.  

The  
night  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
drove  V01
back  
home  <ARGM-GOL
,  
I  >ARG0
found  V01
that  
the  
rear  
window  >>ARG0
has  VLV
some  
leakage  V01
.  

(  
You  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
hear  V01
the  
wind  <ARG1
while  
driving  V01
on  
highway  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Very  
likely  
it  >ARG0
needs  V01
a  
new  
window  
seal  <ARG1
)  
.  

I  >ARG0
admit  V01
that  
I  >>>ARG0
should  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
paid  VLV
attention  V02
to  
this  
kind  <ARG1
of  
little  
things  
while  
test  >ARGM-PRP
drive  V01
.  

(  
But  >ARGM-DIS
this  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
certified  
car  <ARG2
from  
a  
dealer  
.  
)  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
brought  V01
the  
car  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
the  
second  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >ARG0
told  V01
me  <ARG2
that  
this  >>>ARG0
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
under  
warranty  <ARG2
and  
want  V01
to  
charge  V01
me  <ARG2
$  <ARG1
175  
just  >ARGM-ADV
to  
diagnose  V01
the  
problem  <ARG2
!  

Who  >ARG0
knows  V01
how  
much  >>ARG1
they  >>>ARG0
want  V01
me  >ARG0
to  
pay  V01
to  
fix  V02
this  
thing  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
walked  V01
away  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
my  
advice  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
TRUST  V02
THIS  
DEALER  <ARG1
.  

STAY  V01
AWAY  <ARG3
AS  
FAR  <ARGM-ADV
AS  
POSSIBLE  
.  

Perfect  
Practice  

After  
I  >>ARG0
had  V01
chosen  V01
The  
Fountain  
Dental  
Practice  <ARG1
they  >ARG0
provided  V01
a  
slick  >ARGM-ADJ
and  
professional  
service  V02
from  
start  V01
to  
finish  V02
.  

Everyone  >>>ARG0
was  V01
friendly  V01
from  
the  
receptionist  <ARGM-ADV
to  
the  
surgeon  
herself  
,  
putting  V03
me  <ARG1
at  
my  
ease  <ARG2
and  
explaining  V01
the  
whole  >ARGM-ADJ
process  V02
,  
both  
initially  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
then  
as  
we  >ARG0
went  V02
along  <ARGM-PRD
.  

Surgery  >ARGM-PRP
visit  V01
timings  V02
were  V03
always  >ARGM-TMP
made  V02
to  
suit  V01
me  <ARG2
and  
not  
them  
and  
they  >ARG0
gave  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
feeling  V01
that  
I  >>>ARG1
mattered  V01
and  
was  V01
important  V01
to  
them  <ARG2
.  

The  
surgery  >ARG1
itself  
is  V01
slick  <ARG2
,  
modern  
and  
very  
relaxed  
and  
I  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
felt  V02
that  
I  >ARG1
was  V01
in  
capable  
hands  <ARG2
.  

My  
dental  
surgeon  >>ARG0
,  
Dr.  
Lucy  
Nichols  
is  V01
clearly  <ARGM-ADV
a  
dental  
perfectionist  <ARG2
and  
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
proud  V01
both  
of  
the  
work  V01
she  <ARG0
does  VLV
and  
the  
reputation  >>ARG1
she  >>ARG0
has  V01
established  V01
.  

Everyone  >>ARG0
was  V01
so  >ARGM-EXT
helpful  V04
that  
I  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
wait  V01
to  
go  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
.....

Wonderful  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02
for  
large  
group  <ARG2

I  >>ARG0
had  VLV
my  >ARGM-GOL
wedding  >ARGM-PRP
luncheon  V01
at  
this  
BJ  
s  
restaurant  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
choices  V01
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
made  V01
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
deal  V01
--  
we  >ARG0
paid  V01
a  
certain  
amount  <ARG1
per  
person  
,  
and  
my  
husband  >ARG0
and  
I  
chose  V01
4  
types  <ARG1
of  
pizza  
and  
the  
servers  >ARG0
brought  V01
out  <ARG3
as  
much  <ARG1
as  
we  >ARG0
wanted  V01
.  

We  >>ARG2
were  V03
also  >ARGM-DIS
served  V02
salad  <ARG1
and  
soda  
.  

We  >>ARG0
had  VLV
a  
large  >ARGM-EXT
party  V01
,  
about  
fifty  
people  <ARGM-ADJ
or  
so  
,  
and  
yet  
everything  >>ARG1
was  V03
served  V02
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
we  >ARG0
all  
had  V03
a  
wonderful  
time  <ARG1
.  

Even  
though  
we  >>>ARG0
were  V03
only  >ARGM-ADV
supposed  V02
to  
have  V03
those  
specific  
types  <ARG1
of  
pizza  
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
guests  >ARG0
asked  V02
for  
a  
different  
type  <ARG1
,  
it  >>ARG1
was  V03
brought  V01
out  <ARG3
with  
no  >ARGM-NEG
charge  V01
to  
us  <ARG2
!  

I  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
appreciate  V02
BJ  <ARG1
s  
for  
making  V02
that  
special  
day  >ARG1
even  >ARGM-EXT
better  V02
with  
their  >ARG0
wonderful  >ARGM-ADJ
food  <<ARGM-MNR
and  
service  V02
.  

wonderful  

I  >ARG0
went  V02
to  
ohm  <ARG4
after  
reading  V01
some  <ARG1
of  
the  
reviews  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG0
go  V02
to  
school  <ARG4
in  
the  
area  <ARGM-LOC
and  
usually  >ARGM-ADV
wait  V01
until  
I  >ARG0
go  V02
home  <ARG4
to  
get  V04
my  
hair  >ARG1
cut  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG0
decided  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
grow  V04
up  
and  
made  VLV
an  
appointment  V02
.  

Sierra  >ARG1
was  V01
my  
stylist  <ARG2
and  
i  >ARG0
love  V01
what  >ARG1
she  >ARG0
did  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
wavy  
hair  <ARG1
and  
she  >ARG0
cut  V01
to  
my  
hair  
style  <ARGM-MNR
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
first  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
i  >>ARG0
had  V01
left  V11
a  
salon  <ARG1
with  
my  
hair  
curly  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Usually  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
blow  V01
dry  V03
it  <ARG1
out  <C-V
and  
i  >>>ARG0
have  V02
to  
wait  V01
until  
i  >ARG0
wash  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
see  V01
what  >ARG1
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
look  V02
like  <C-ARG1
in  
its  
natural  
state  <ARGM-ADV
.  

But  >>>ARGM-DIS
she  >>>ARG0
did  V02
a  
fabulous  
job  <ARG1
letting  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
what  >>ARG1
she  >>ARG0
was  V03
doing  V02
at  
all  
times  <ARGM-TMP
and  
styled  V01
my  
hair  <ARG1
in  
a  
way  V01
i  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
it  <ARG1
at  
home  <ARGM-LOC
.  

It  >>ARG1
was  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
completly  >ARGM-EXT
impossible  V01
!!!!  

I  >>ARG0
am  V03
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
going  V02
back  <ARG4

After  
recently  >ARGM-TMP
relocating  V01
to  
South  
Bend  <ARG2
,  
we  >>ARG0
were  V03
looking  V01
for  
a  
delicious  
,  
fun  
,  
yet  
elegant  
establishment  <ARG1
for  
New  
Year  
s  
Eve  
dinner  <ARGM-PRP
.  

We  >ARG1
were  V01
disappointed  <ARG2
with  
this  
holiday  
dinner  
due  
to  
the  
overall  >ARGM-ADJ
flavor  <ARGM-CAU
and  
price  V01
of  
the  
meal  <ARG1
,  
and  
accessibility  
to  
the  
Jazz  
Club  
.  

The  
meal  >>>ARG1
was  V01
extremely  
overpriced  <ARG2
and  
lacked  V01
flavor  <ARG1
,  
especially  
for  
being  V01
a  
special  
NYE  
menu  <ARG2
.  

The  
limited  
menu  >ARG0
had  V03
few  
appetizing  
options  <ARG1
and  
the  
NYE  
special  
packages  >ARG1
were  V01
way  
overpriced  <ARG2
.  

After  
our  
meal  >ARGM-TMP
,  
our  
server  >ARG0
found  V01
us  <ARG2
a  
table  <ARG1
in  
the  
jazz  
club  >>ARGM-LOC
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
we  >>ARG1
were  V03
informed  V01
it  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
another  
$  <ARG2
10  
/  
person  
to  
stay  V01
and  
listen  V01
to  
the  
band  <ARG1
,  
despite  
the  
fact  <<<ARGM-ADV
we  >>>ARG0
had  V01
just  >ARGM-TMP
finished  V01
a  
dinner  <ARG1
there  <ARGM-LOC
and  
were  V03
intending  V01
to  
enjoy  V01
their  
drink  
list  <ARG1
.  

This  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
less  >ARGM-ADJ
than  
impressive  
experience  V01
at  
Trio  <ARGM-LOC
's  
.  

Run  V02
for  
the  
hills  <ARGM-DIR
...  
you  >>ARG1
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
much  >ARGM-EXT
better  V06
off  
!  

One  
night  >>ARG1
was  V01
too  >ARGM-EXT
much  V01
.  

First  
room  >ARG0
had  V03
used  
tissues  <ARG1
next  
to  
the  
bed  
and  
I  >ARG0
requested  V01
it  >>ARG1
be  V03
rectified  V01
.  

I  >>ARG1
was  V03
then  >ARGM-TMP
moved  V01
to  
another  
room  >>>ARGM-LOC
around  
the  
back  
where  >>>R-ARGM-LOC
the  
room  >>ARG1
was  V01
dirty  V02
,  
the  
shower  V01
was  V01
dirty  V02
with  
other  
people  
s  
hair  <ARG2
in  
it  
,  
the  
toilet  
seat  >>ARG1
was  V01
peeling  V01
and  
rough  
and  
the  
bathroom  >>ARG1
was  V01
full  V01
of  
mould  <ARG2
.  

I  >>>ARG2
called  V02
reception  <ARG1
to  
ask  V01
if  
they  >ARG0
knew  V01
the  
state  >ARG2
the  
room  >ARG1
was  V01
in  <C-ARG2
and  
was  V03
told  V01
"  
This  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
Days  
Inn  <ARG2
,  
not  
the  
Hilton  
"  
and  
the  
receptionist  >ARG0
then  >ARGM-TMP
hung  V03
up  
on  
me  <ARG2
.  

To  
warn  V01
you  >ARG1
to  
stay  V01
away  <ARG3
from  
this  
place  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
is  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
enough  V01
.  

There  
was  V02
not  <ARGM-NEG
one  
ounce  <ARG1
of  
caring  V01
involved  
and  
anyone  >>>ARG2
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
warn  V01
about  
the  
complete  >ARGM-EXT
lack  V01
of  
service  V02
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
warned  V01
.

Before  
using  V01
FusionRetail  <ARG1
Before  
installing  V01
FusionRetail  <ARG1
store  >>ARG1
was  V03
running  V01
on  
a  
dos  >ARG2
based  V02
software  <ARG1
.  

We  >>>ARG0
were  V03
having  V03
a  
major  
problem  <ARG1
in  
maintaining  V01
cash  <ARG1
.  

Being  V01
a  
grocery  
shop  >>ARG1
,  
maintaining  V01
5000  
different  
products  <ARG1
was  V01
a  
challenging  
job  <ARG2
.  

Managing  V01
POS  
counter  <ARG1
without  
barcoding  V01
was  V01
really  <ARGM-ADV
a  
tough  
time  <ARG2
.  

How  >>ARGM-MNR
FusionRetail  >>ARG0
has  V01
overcome  V01
these  
issues  V02
?  

FusionRetail  >ARG0
helps  V01
us  >ARG0
to  
maintain  V01
the  
store  <ARG1
in  
an  
organised  >ARGM-MNR
way  V01
.  

Usage  >>>ARG1
of  
product  
barcodes  
and  
smooth  >ARGM-ADJ
maintenance  V01
of  
inventory  <ARG1
with  
proper  >ARGM-ADJ
recording  V01
of  
transactions  V01
like  
sale  V01
,  
purchase  V01
and  
returns  V02
was  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
easy  V05
before  <ARGM-TMP
.  

How  
long  >>ARG1
does  V01
it  >>ARG0
take  V10
to  
train  V01
new  
people  <ARG2
at  
work  V01
?  

Billing  V01

15  
minutes  <ARG1

How

your

Over

On

it  
takes  V10
a  
day  <ARG1
to  
get  V04
our  >ARG1
issues  V02
resolved  V01
.  

Ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
wait  V01
to  
go  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
!!!  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
by  
far  <ARGM-EXT
the  
BEST  
B&B  >>ARG3
that  >>R-ARG3
we  >>ARG1
have  V01
ever  >ARGM-NEG
stayed  V01
at  <C-ARG3
!  

We  >ARG1
were  V01
in  
Santa  
Fe  <ARG2
for  
a  
special  
event  <ARGM-PRP
and  
our  
hosts  >ARG0
rented  V03
out  
the  
El  
Paradero  >ARG3
for  
all  
their  
guests  >ARG1
to  
stay  V01
at  <C-ARG3
.  

We  >>>ARG2
could  >>>ARGM-MOD
not  >>>ARGM-NEG
have  V01
been  V01
more  >ARGM-EXT
welcomed  V01
,  
more  
comfortable  
or  
more  
well  >ARGM-ADV
fed  V01
.  

The  
weekend  >>ARG1
was  V01
perfect  V02
in  
every  
way  <ARGM-ADV
,  
in  
large  
part  
to  
Sue  <ARGM-CAU
and  
her  
great  
staff  
.  

Everyone  >>>ARG0
was  V01
so  >ARGM-EXT
friendly  V01
and  
really  >ARGM-ADV
went  V02
out  
of  
their  >ARG0
way  V01
to  
make  V02
sure  V01
everything  >ARG1
went  V06
well  <ARGM-MNR
.  

We  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
wait  V01
to  
go  V02
back  <ARG4
to  
Santa  
Fe  <ARG4
and  
to  
this  
great  
B&B  
...  
especially  
my  
4  
year  
old  >>>ARG0
,  
who  >>>R-ARG0
made  V01
friends  <ARG1
with  
Ms.  <ARGM-COM
Sue  
and  
all  
the  
ladies  
,  
and  
has  V01
talked  V01
about  
them  <ARG1
since  
we  >ARG0
left  V11
!  

We  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
the  
El  
Paradero  <ARG1
on  
your  >ARG0
next  >ARGM-TMP
trip  V03
to  
Santa  
Fe  <ARG1
!  

Disatisfied  
customer  
,  
I  >>ARG0
went  V06
through  
Kitchen  
Aid  <ARG2
and  
used  V01
one  <ARG1
of  
their  
recommended  
vendors  
.  

A&E  >>ARG0
came  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR
,  
charged  V01
$  
129  
fee  <ARG1
just  >ARGM-ADV
to  
walk  V01
in  
the  
door  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
needed  V01
a  
part  <ARG1
for  
my  
appliance  
,  
the  
cost  >>ARG1
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
high  V02
so  >>>ARGM-ADV
I  >>>ARG0
said  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
mind  V03
,  
paid  V01
the  
fee  <ARG1
and  
called  V02
a  
local  
business  <ARG1
for  
a  
second  >ARGM-TMP
quote  V01
.  

The  
second  
vendor  >>>ARG0
charged  V01
$  <ARG1
55  
(  
less  
than  
half  
of  
what  >ARG1
A&E  >ARG0
charges  V01
)  
to  
come  V01
and  
applied  V02
that  <ARG1
to  
the  
price  V01
of  
the  
repair  >ARG1
service  V01
(  
which  
A&E  
does  V01
not  
)  
.  

Their  >ARG0
quote  V01
came  V07
in  
at  
half  
the  
price  V01
of  
A&E  <ARG0
for  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
work  V01
and  
same  
part  
.  

Seems  V01
to  
me  <ARG2
like  
A&E  >ARG0
charges  V01
way  
more  <ARG1
than  
necessary  
!  

Very  
disappointed  
in  
Kitchen  
Aid  
as  
well  
,  
I  >ARG0
thought  V01
that  
they  >ARG0
pre-screened  V01
their  
vendors  <ARG1
for  
price  V01
and  
quality  
of  
work  V01
,  
obviously  
they  
do  V01
not  
!  

Lovely  
Nails  
on  
Cayuga  
St.  
in  
Lewiston  
,  
NY  

First  >ARGM-TMP
let  V01
me  >ARG0
start  V05
out  
by  
saying  V01
,  
that  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
had  V03
very  
nice  
pedicures  <ARG1
at  
Lovely  
Nails  <ARGM-LOC
on  
Military  
Road  
.  

I  >>ARG1
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
excited  V01
that  
a  
salon  >>ARG1
was  V03
opening  V01
in  
Lewiston  <ARGM-LOC
,  
as  
I  >ARG0
live  V01
in  
Youngstown  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
was  V01
in  <ARG2
two  
weeks  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
and  
had  V03
the  
worst  
pedicure  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
had  V03
in  
my  
life  <ARGM-TMP
.  

There  
were  V02
four  <ARG1
of  
us  
and  
I  >>ARG1
was  V03
taken  V01
first  <ARGM-TMP
by  
a  
gentleman  <ARG0
.  

I  >ARG0
put  V01
my  
foot  <ARG1
in  
the  
water  <ARG2
and  
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
cool  V06
.  

He  >>ARG0
did  V01
warm  V02
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
hurt  V01
my  
toes  <ARG1
will  
pushing  V01
my  
cuticles  <ARG1
back  <ARG2
.  

If  
the  
pedicure  >ARG1
lasted  V01
20  
mins.  <ARG2
,  
that  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
stretch  <ARG2
.  

The  
other  
ladies  >>ARG0
had  VLV
a  
similar  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
,  
both  >ARG0
had  V03
nail  
polish  <ARG1
on  
a  
couple  <ARGM-LOC
of  
toes  
.  

None  >>ARG0
of  
us  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
using  V01
their  >ARG0
services  V01
again  <<ARGM-TMP
,  
which  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
shame  V02
.  

Good  >ARGM-ADJ
Service  V02
-  
Limited  
Results  

Andrew  >>>ARG0
was  V01
helpful  V04
and  
knowledgeable  V01
about  
acupuncture  <ARG1
re  
:  
infertility  
.  

He  >>>ARG0
was  V01
willing  V02
to  
talk  V01
to  
me  <ARG2
about  
my  >ARG1
specific  >ARGM-ADJ
issues  V02
and  
develop  V02
a  
plan  V01
of  
action  V02
.  

The  
office  >>ARG1
is  V03
shared  V01
with  
a  
foot  
doctor  <ARG2
and  
it  >>ARG1
's  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
sterile  V02
and  
medical  
feeling  
,  
which  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
liked  V01
.  

The  
down  
side  >ARG1
was  V01
that  
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
there  
was  V02
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
noise  
in  
the  
hallway  
from  
other  
patients  
/  
doctors  
.  

I  >>ARG0
worked  V01
with  
Andrew  <ARG3
for  
2  
months  <ARGM-TMP
and  
did  V02
acupuncture  <ARG1
and  
herbs  
.  

The  
sessions  V01
were  V01
nice  V01
and  
I  >>>ARG0
felt  V01
relaxed  <ARG1
after  
them  <ARGM-TMP
but  
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
notice  V01
any  
changes  V01
with  
my  
cycles  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
know  V01
it  
can  >ARGM-MOD
take  V10
a  
while  <ARG1
for  
results  <ARG0
and  
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
expect  V01
a  
miracle  <ARG1
,  
but  
after  
2  
months  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
felt  V01
like  
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
entirely  >ARGM-EXT
worth  V02
the  
cost  <ARG2
/  
time  
.  

(  
I  >ARG1
am  V01
also  <ARGM-ADV
a  
little  
suspicious  <ARG2
of  
all  
these  
glowing  V01
reviews  V01
...  
)  

Friendly  
,  
clean  
and  
excellent  
location  

The  
staff  >>>ARG0
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful  V04
,  
and  
gave  V01
us  <ARG2
good  
advice  <ARG1
on  
day  
and  
night  
time  
activities  
.  

Common  
room  >>ARG1
was  V01
comfortable  <ARG2
and  
clean  V04
,  
very  
good  
room  >>ARGM-LOC
to  
read  V01
or  
relax  V01
.  
–  

A  
great  
breakfast  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
was  V03
included  V01
every  
morning  
until  
9:30  
am  
;  
yummy  
fresh  
Parisian  
croissants  
.  

Comfortable  
and  
clean  
beds  
,  
a  
bit  
noisy  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
people  >>ARG1
were  V03
coming  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
late  <ARGM-TMP
from  
a  
night  <ARG3
out  
,  
but  
we  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
mind  V01
too  
much  <ARGM-EXT
as  
we  >>ARG1
were  V03
also  >ARGM-ADV
just  >ARGM-TMP
coming  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
from  
a  
night  <ARG3
out  
!  

The  
location  >ARG1
is  V01
really  
stellar  <ARG2
!  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
next  
to  
Gare  <ARG2
du  
Nord  
and  
a  
five  
minute  >ARGM-TMP
walk  V01
to  
Sacre  
Coeur  <ARG2
which  >>ARG0
is  V01
excellent  V01
for  
shopping  V01
.  

It  >>ARG1
is  V01
close  V10
to  
bus  
lines  <ARG2
for  
Opera  
Plaza  
,  
Galleries  
Lafayette  
,  
and  
the  
famous  
flea  
Market  
.  

We  >>>ARG1
really  >ARGM-ADV
enjoyed  V01
our  >ARG1
stay  V01
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
stay  V01
at  
the  
Vintage  
Hostel  <ARG3
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Just  
Autos  >ARGM-DIS
Thank  V01
you  <ARG1
!  

Was  V01
fast  V02
and  
easy  V05
,  
Just  >ARGM-ADV
had  V04
our  
car  >ARG1
returned  V02
this  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
recommend  V01
these  
Mobile  
Mechanics  <ARG1
for  
sure  <ARGM-ADV
.  

They  >ARG0
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
know  V01
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
doing  V02
.  

The  
mechanic  >>ARG0
came  V01
to  
our  
place  <ARG4
and  
sorted  V02
out  
our  
car  
s  
problems  <ARG1
,  
he  >>>ARG0
explained  V01
the  
problem  <ARG1
and  
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
up  
front  <ARG2
and  
honest  V01
,  
it  >>ARG1
was  V03
towed  V01
to  
the  
workshop  <ARG2
as  
the  
gearbox  >>ARG1
was  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
working  V09
(  
he  >ARG0
explained  V01
it  <ARG1
better  <ARGM-CXN
)  
.  

They  >>>ARG0
phoned  V01
the  
same  
day  <ARGM-TMP
,  
confirmed  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
gearbox  <ARG2
quoted  V01
me  <ARGM-GOL
the  
job  <ARG3
,  
I  >>ARG0
gave  V01
the  
go  
ahead  V_
.  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP
my  
car  
s  
gears  >>ARG1
and  
brakes  
have  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
run  V01
so  
well  <ARGM-EXT
...  
ever  <ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
s  V01
like  
driving  V01
a  
new  
car  <ARG1
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hesitate  V01
in  
recommending  V01
the

Thank  V01
you  <ARG1
Just  
Autos  <ARGM-DIS
for  
your  >ARG0
help  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
stopped  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
today  <ARGM-TMP
@  
Yards  
Brewery  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
,  
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
impressed  V01
with  
the  
size  <ARG0
of  
the  
bar  
area  
and  
lounge  
,  
&  
I  >ARG0
liked  V01
that  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
the  
brewery  <ARG1
right  
thru  
the  
glass  <ARGM-DIR
!  

I  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
sampler  <ARG1
of  
IPA  
,  
Brawler  
,  
Love  
Stout  
&  
ESA  
.  

All  >>ARG0
were  V01
awesome  V01
,  
&  
I  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
Dogwood  
Grilled  
Cheese  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
was  V01
enjoyable  V02
with  
the  
fine  
beers  <ARGM-COM
.  

After  
my  
sampler  >ARGM-TMP
&  
sandwich  
,  
I  >ARG0
asked  V02
for  
a  
pint  <ARG1
of  
there  
Nitrogen  
Love  
Stout  
,  
I  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
impressed  V01
,  
with  
the  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
taste  V01
&  
I  >ARG1
am  V01
a  
Guiness  
Lover  <ARG2
so  >>ARGM-ADV
coming  V01
from  
me  <ARG3
,  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
this  >>ARG1
is  V01
better  V02
,  
it  >>ARG1
s  V01
less  
dry  <ARG2
&  
smoother  V06
!  

If  
you  >ARG1
are  V01
in  
Philly  <ARG2
you  >>>ARG0
have  V02
to  
come  V28
check  V05
this  
place  <ARG1
out  <C-V
!  

The  
only  
negative  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
have  V03
abou  
this  
place  
is  V01
the  
parking  V01
!  

I  >ARG0
left  V11
with  
a  
case  <ARGM-MNR
of  
BRAWLER  
!!!!  
!  

Oil  >ARG1
Change  V01
Disaster  

My  
wife  >>ARG0
had  V01
taken  V01
her  
'07  
Ford  
Fusion  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
for  
a  
routine  >ARGM-ADJ
oil  >ARG1
change  V01
.  

A  
couple  
days  
after  
the  
oil  >ARG1
change  V01
,  
the  
engine  >ARG1
ran  V01
rough  <ARGM-MNR
,  
the  
low  
oil  
pressure  
light  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
come  V08
on  
sporadically  <ARGM-ADV
,  
and  
the  
engine  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
whir  V01
loudly  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Turns  V11
out  
the  
engine  >ARG0
had  V03
no  
oil  <ARG1
,  
and  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
oil  >>ARG1
was  V03
put  V01
it  <ARG2
,  
it  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
run  V02
out  
of  
the  
filter  <ARGM-DIR
.  

There  
could  
have  VLV
(  
hopefully  
does  V01
n't  
have  VLV
)  
major  >ARGM-EXT
damage  V01
to  
the  
engine  <ARG1
.  

All  >ARG1
of  
this  
started  V01
after  
their  >ARG0
oil  >ARG1
change  V01
.  

Once  
they  >ARG0
realized  V01
their  >ARG0
mistake  V02
they  >>>ARG0
sent  V01
a  
mechanic  <ARG1
and  
tow  
truck  
to  
my  
wife  >ARG0
's  
work  V01
and  
towed  V01
it  <ARG1
back  <ARG2
to  
fix  V02
it  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
recommend  V01
this  
shop  <ARG1
for  
anything  <ARG4
,  
not  
even  
something  
as  
simple  
as  
an  
oil  >ARG1
change  V01
.  

Plus  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
overcharge  V01
you  <ARG2
for  
just  
about  
everything  <ARG3
,  
and  
smile  V01
while  
doing  V02
it  <ARG1
.  

Liars  
,  
negative  
stars  
!  

Took  V01
my  
Cruze  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
twice  <ARGM-TMP
for  
poor  
fuel  
economy  <ARGM-CAU
.  

The  
first  
time  >ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG0
claimed  V01
to  
get  V01
reasonable  
mpg  <ARG1
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
they  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
drive  V01
the  
car  <ARG1
with  
me  
in  
it  <ARGM-ADV
to  
prove  V01
their  >ARG0
findings  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
wonder  V01
if  
they  >>ARG0
were  V03
going  V02
down  
a  
hill  <ARGM-DIR
!  

They  >ARG0
told  V01
me  >ARG0
to  
bring  V01
it  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
after  
5000  
miles  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
brought  V01
it  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
with  
9000  
miles  <ARGM-ADV
.  

They  >>>ARG0
"  
finished  V01
"  
the  
work  V01
and  
told  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
car  >>ARG1
was  V01
ready  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
found  V03
out  
they  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
drive  V01
the  
car  <ARG1
,  
stated  V01
they  >ARG0
looked  V01
at  
it  <ARG1
before  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >>ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
drive  V01
the  
car  <ARG1
with  
me  <ARGM-COM
to  
show  V01
their  
mpg  
number  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
claimed  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
see  V01
anything  <ARG1
wrong  
with  
the  
blower  
fan  
(  
a  
seperate  >ARGM-ADJ
issue  V02
)  
,  
but  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
drove  V01
the  
car  <ARG1
home  <ARGM-GOL
I  >ARG0
had  V03
the  
same  
symptoms  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
purchace  V01
another  
vehicle  <ARG1
from  
Vic  <ARG2
Canever  
.  

Great  
Job  

I  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
say  V01
that  
Mike  >ARG0
did  V02
a  
great  
job  <ARG1
for  
our  
family  <ARG2
in  
our  
time  <ARGM-TMP
of  
need  V01
.  

Both  
my  
grandparents  >ARG1
passed  V16
away  
4  
months  
apart  <ARGM-TMP
and  
Mike  >ARG1
was  V01
very  
understanding  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
very  
trying  
time  <ARG2
for  
my  
family  
and  
myself  
yet  
Mike  >ARG0
took  V01
the  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
greet  V01
each  
and  
every  
one  <ARG1
one  <ARG1
of  
us  
.  

He  >ARG1
is  V01
very  
professional  <ARG2
in  
his  
position  <ARGM-ADV
as  
a  
director  
and  
yet  
he  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-ADV
made  V01
time  >ARGM-ADV
to  
be  V01
compassionate  <ARG2
for  
what  >>ARG2
we  >>ARG1
were  V03
all  
going  V12
through  <C-ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
sure  V02
it  
s  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
every  
day  <ARG2
that  
a  
funeral  
director  >ARG0
sees  V01
the  
same  
family  <ARG1
in  
such  
a  
short  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

My  
grandfather  >ARG1
passed  V16
away  
silently  <ARGM-MNR
in  
his  
sleep  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
my  
grandmother  >ARG1
passed  V16
away  
after  
a  
short  >ARGM-TMP
struggle  V01
with  
cancer  <ARG1
.  

Both  
my  
grandparents  >>ARG1
looked  V02
as  >ARGM-CXN
natural  V03
as  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
expected  V01
.  

Thank  V01
you  <ARG1
Mike  <ARGM-DIS
for  
all  
your  >ARG0
help  V01
professionally  <<ARGM-MNR
and  
personally  
.  

The  
Peterson  
Family  

Poor  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02

If  
you  >ARG0
like  V01
the  
drama  >ARG1
described  V01
in  
popular  
sitcom  <ARGM-LOC
'  
Seinfeld  
'  
,  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
it  <ARG1
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

We  >ARG0
signed  V06
our  
name  <ARG1
in  <C-V
about  
6:00  
pm  <ARGM-TMP
.  

There  
were  V02
3  
names  <ARG1
before  
us  
.  

The  
greeter  >ARG0
said  V01
there  
was  V02
about  
15  
minutes  >ARGM-TMP
waiting  V01
.  

However  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
we  >>>ARG0
waited  V01
and  
waited  V01
and  
in  
the  
mean  
time  >ARGM-TMP
,  
saw  V01
4  
groups  >ARG0
of  
people  
simply  >ARGM-MNR
just  >ARGM-ADV
paraded  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
without  
signing  V01
there  
names  <ARG2
.  

This  
sign  
in  
policy  >>ARG1
is  V03
posted  V01
by  
the  
restaurant  <ARG0
“  
no  >ARGM-NEG
reservation  V01
,  
sign  V01
your  
name  <ARG2
here  <ARGM-LOC
”  
.  

I  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
ask  V01
the  
greeter  <ARG2
,  
he  >ARG0
explained  V01
his  
reasons  <ARG1
with  
broken  
English  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
understand  V01
any  
his  
reasons  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
take  V01
it  <ARG1
as  
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
seat  V01
the  
people  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
know  V02
first  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

My  >ARG0
conclusion  V01
is  V01
that  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
go  V02
there  <ARG4
if  
you  >>>ARG0
want  V01
to  
wait  V01
a  
least  
an  
hour  <ARGM-TMP
and  
see  V01
all  
kinds  >>ARG1
other  
people  
being  V03
seated  V01
before  
you  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Instructor  >ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
showed  V02
up  
!  

January  
15th  
--  
We  >>ARG1
were  V03
signed  V03
up  
for  
Saturday  
's  
2  
PM  
class  <ARG3
"  
Beginning  
Yoga  
with  
Brittany  
.  
"  

We  >ARG1
even  >ARGM-ADV
arrived  V01
10  
minutes  
early  <ARGM-TMP
as  
the  
website  >ARG0
suggests  V01
.  

The  
instructor  >>ARG1
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
show  V02
up  
!  

We  >>ARG0
waited  V01
until  
2:25  
PM  <ARGM-TMP
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
left  V11
.  

There  
were  V02
2  <ARG1
in  
our  
group  
,  
and  
a  
3rd  
person  >>ARG1
was  V01
also  <ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
parking  
lot  <ARG2
waiting  V01
for  
this  
class  <ARG2
.  

Well  
,  
not  
much  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
except  
I  >ARG1
'm  V01
very  
disappointed  <ARG2
with  
this  
experience  V01
.  

This  >ARG1
was  V01
our  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
visit  V01
to  
your  
studio  <ARG1
.  

In  
today  
's  
instant  
world  >ARGM-LOC
,  
there  
's  V02
no  
reason  <ARG1
for  
the  
instructor  
not  
to  
even  
have  V01
given  VLV
us  
a  
phone  >ARGM-MNR
call  V02
or  
e-mail  
if  
she  >>>ARG1
was  V03
going  V04
to  
be  V01
late  V02
.  

As  
a  
yoga  
studio  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
sure  V02
you  >>ARG0
're  V01
all  >ARGM-ADV
aware  V01
that  
all  
actions  V02
generate  V01
karma  <ARG1
…  

and  >ARGM-DIS
sometimes  >ARGM-TMP
karma  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
manifest  V01
itself  <ARG2
on  
a  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
review  V01
on  
Google  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Finest  
??  

Really  
??  

I  >>ARG0
beg  V01
to  
differ  V01
.  

This  
place  >>ARG1
is  V01
marginal  V02
at  
best  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Not  
very  
welcoming  
and  
focused  
mostly  
on  
keeping  V02
little  
kids  <ARG1
entertained  <ARG2
.  

I  >>>ARG1
was  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
impressed  V01
,  
and  
quite  >ARGM-EXT
frustrated  V01
at  
their  >ARG0
lack  V01
of  
rating  V01
for  
their  
courses  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
understand  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
wanting  V01
to  
put  V01
labels  <ARG1
like  
5.10  
on  
an  
indoor  
course  <ARG2
,  
because  
yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
same  <ARG2
,  
but  
some  
clear  >ARGM-ADJ
understanding  V01
of  
the  
difficulty  <ARG1
of  
one  
course  
to  
another  
is  V01
nice  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >>>ARG0
are  V01
an  
intermediate  
climber  >ARG0
looking  V04
to  
improve  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
waste  V01
my  
time  <ARG1
on  
routes  >ARG1
set  V02
for  
children  <ARG2
,  
but  
I  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
take  V09
on  
something  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
handle  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
to  
strain  V03
myself  <ARG1
to  
exhaustion  <ARGM-EXT
.  

Rate  V01
the  
routes  <ARG1
,  
with  
understandable  >ARGM-ADJ
markings  V02
and  
a  
more  
detailed  
system  
than  
easy  
,  
moderate  
,  
and  
hard  
.  

Again  
,  
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
outing  V07
for  
the  
kids  <ARG0
,  
a  
frustration  V01
for  
an  
out  
of  
town  
climber  <ARG1
.  

Best  
DJ's  
In  
Town  
!  

Wow  
!  

These  
guys  >ARG1
were  V01
the  
best  <ARG2
.  

They  >>>ARG0
were  V01
thorough  V01
,  
high  
class  
,  
and  
went  V02
above  <ARGM-ADV
and  
beyond  
.  

We  >>ARG0
never  
had  V02
to  
worry  V02
about  
a  
thing  <ARG1
,  
and  
they  >ARG0
led  V02
the  
way  V01
the  
whole  
time  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >>>ARG0
asked  V01
us  <ARG2
things  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
we  >>>ARG0
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
never  >>ARGM-NEG
have  V01
thought  V01
of  <C-ARG1
,  
and  
took  V01
extra  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
meet  V03
with  
us  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
needed  V01
it  <ARG1
before  
the  
wedding  V01
.  

Having  V03
a  
team  <ARG1
was  V01
the  
best  <ARG2
because  
they  >ARG0
kept  V02
the  
flow  V01
of  
the  
wedding  V01
going  V01
the  
whole  
time  <ARGM-TMP
!  

They  >>>ARG0
may  >>ARGM-MOD
look  V02
young  V01
but  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
let  V01
that  >ARG0
fool  V01
you  <ARG1
,  
as  
their  
knowledge  >ARG0
of  
music  
far  >ARGM-EXT
surpassed  V01
what  >ARG1
we  >ARG0
expected  V01
.  

I  >ARG1
am  V01
a  
music  
junkie  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
grew  V04
up  
in  
the  
80's  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
my  
dad  >ARG0
worked  V01
for  
a  
record  
label  <ARG2
in  
the  
1960's  <ARGM-TMP
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
we  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
expect  V01
them  >ARG0
to  
even  >ARGM-ADV
know  V01
some  <ARG1
of  
the  
requests  V01
that  >R-ARG1
we  >ARG0
asked  V02
that  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
really  >ARGM-EXT
know  V01
their  
stuff  <ARG1
!  

NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
fear  V01
going  V02
to  
the  
dentist  <ARG4
again  <<ARGM-TMP
!  

I  >>>ARG0
'm  V01
61  
years  >ARG2
old  V01
and  
have  V03
dental  
problems  <ARG1
my  
entire  
life  <ARGM-TMP
.  

By  
the  
age  >ARGM-TMP
of  
24  
I  >>ARG0
stopped  V01
going  V02
to  
the  
dentist  <ARG4
.  

My  >ARG0
fear  V01
and  
discomfort  
from  
dental  >ARG1
work  V01
scared  V01
me  <ARG1
!  

It  >ARG0
took  V10
all  
the  
courage  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
muster  V01
to  
make  VLV
an  
appointment  V02
.  

At  
the  
front  
door  >ARGM-LOC
of  
his  
office  
,  
I  >ARG0
nearly  >ARGM-ADV
turned  V01
around  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >>ARG0
considered  V02
just  >ARGM-ADV
leaving  V11
after  
going  V02
inside  <ARG4
and  
nearly  
did  V01
.  

Doctor  >ARG1
Gonzales  
and  
his  
entire  
staff  
are  V01
the  
most  
professional  
people  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
dealt  V01
with  <C-ARG1
.  

They  >>>ARG0
made  V02
me  >>ARG1
feel  V01
confident  V01
in  
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
,  
and  
treated  V01
me  <ARG1
like  
a  
member  <ARG2
of  
their  
own  
family  
.  

I  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
felt  V01
pain  <ARG1
or  
discomfort  
.  

The  
ability  >>>ARG1
to  
smile  V01
and  
eat  V01
again  <ARGM-TMP
can  >>ARGM-MOD
only  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V03
described  V01
as  
a  
whole  
new  
lease  <ARG2

HORRIBLE  >ARGM-ADJ
SERVICE  V02
AND  
FOOD  

not  
only  
is  V01
this  
place  >ARG1
too  >ARGM-CXN
expensive  V02
for  
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
it  >>ARG1
s  V01
horrible  V01
!  

In  
the  
past  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG0
got  V01
a  
steak  <ARG1
and  
there  
was  V02
more  
fat  <ARG1
and  
rough  
pieces  
than  
there  
was  V02
good  
steak  <ARG1
(  
and  
this  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
sirloin  <ARG2
!  
)  
,  
the  
sides  >>ARG1
were  V03
drenched  V01
with  
butter  <ARG2
and  
the  
salad  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
little  
on  
the  
brown  
side  <ARG2
.  

Today  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
went  V02
for  
a  
party  V01
(  
during  
lunch  
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
the  
place  >ARG1
was  V01
empty  <ARG2
)  
with  
about  
25  
other  
people  <<<ARGM-COM
.  

It  
took  V10
over  
1.5  
hours  <ARG1
for  
our  
food  >ARG1
to  
come  V09
out  
and  
by  
that  
time  >ARGM-TMP
my  
8  
month  >ARG0
old  
had  V03
it  <ARG1
!  

Does  V01
it  >ARG0
seriously  >ARGM-ADV
take  V10
that  
long  <ARG1
for  
a  
soup  <ARGM-PRP
and  
salad  
?  

I  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
waitress  <ARG2
for  
years  <ARGM-TMP
and  
a  
key  >ARGM-ADJ
rule  V01
is  V01
to  
serve  V02
customers  <ARG2
with  
small  
children  
before  
others  <ARGM-TMP
,  
as  
I  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
last  >ARG0
to  
get  V01
my  
food  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
recommend  V01
having  V03
a  
party  V01
here  <<ARGM-LOC
or  
even  >ARGM-ADV
going  V02
here  <ARG4
.  

Texas  
Roadhouse  >>ARG1
is  V01
WAY  >ARGM-EXT
better  V02
!!  

Spay  >ARG1
and  
neuter  
service  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  VLV
no  >ARGM-NEG
doubt  V01
that  
the  
rescue  V01
is  V01
wonderful  V03
.  

But  
I  >ARG0
had  V04
my  
cat  >ARG1
spayed  V01
through  
their  
reduced  
/  
free  
spay  
and  
neuter  
program  <ARGM-MNR
and  
the  
vet  >>ARG1
they  >ARG0
sent  V02
us  <ARG1
to  <C-ARG2
was  V01
first  <ARGM-ADV
of  
all  
a  
hour  
and  
a  
half  
away  <ARG2
,  
and  
4  
days  
later  
we  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
bring  V01
them  <ARG1
to  
our  
normal  
vet  <ARG2
because  
the  
vets  >ARG0
at  
the  
place  
in  
wisconsin  
did  V02
a  
crappy  
job  <ARG1
and  
they  >>ARG1
got  VLV
infections  V01
.  

My  
vet  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
said  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
my  >ARG1
fault  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
vet  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
did  V02
the  
surgery  <ARG1
,  
So  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
recommend  V01
getting  V01
that  
program  <ARG1
unless  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
an  
extra  
hundred  
dollars  <ARG1
or  
so  
for  
antibiotics  
and  
a  
vet  >ARG1
visit  V01
.  

You  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
think  V01
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
a  
good  
job  <ARG1
but  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
care  V01
unless  
they  >>>ARG2
are  V03
getting  V03
paid  V01
full  >ARGM-MNR
price  V01
.  

Which  >>ARG1
is  V01
so  >ARGM-EXT
dumb  V01
.  

Not  
to  
mention  
the  
fact  
that  
they  >ARG0
gave  V03
us  <ARG2
our  
cats  <ARG1
back  <C-V
not  
even  
30  
minutes  
after  
they  >ARG1
were  V01
out  <ARG2
from  
surgery  
.  

Billing  >ARG0
Issues  V02
...  

I  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
routine  
surgery  <ARG1
for  
an  
ingrown  
toenail  
.  

My  
insurance  
company  >ARG0
,  
Blue  
Cross  
/  
Blue  
Shield  
paid  V01
the  
fees  <ARG1
and  
everything  >>ARG1
was  V01
fine  V04
.  

Then  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
got  V01
a  
bill  <ARG1
for  
$  
483.00  
.  

The  
doctor  
's  
office  >ARG0
said  V01
that  
payments  V01
had  V01
been  V03
"  
reversed  V01
"  
.  

Blue  
cross  >ARG0
has  V03
no  
record  <ARG1
of  
aa  
reversal  V01
.  

The  
office  >ARG0
refused  V01
my  >ARG0
requests  V01
to  
see  V01
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
got  V01
from  
BC  <ARG2
/  
BS  
.  

They  >>ARG0
eventually  >>ARGM-TMP
turned  V12
it  <ARG1
over  <C-V
to  
a  
collection  
agency  <ARG2
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
discuss  V01
the  
matter  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
eventually  >ARGM-TMP
decided  V01
to  
just  >ARGM-ADV
pay  V01
the  
balance  <ARG1
even  
though  
the  
doctor  >>>ARG2
has  V01
already  >>ARGM-TMP
been  V03
paid  V01
,  
but  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
collection  
agency  >>>ARG0
is  V03
trying  V01
to  
say  V01
another  
reversal  V01
of  
$  <ARG1
160.00  
has  V01
come  V18
through  
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
an  
ingrown  
toenail  <ARG2
.  

How  
much  >ARG2
could  >ARGM-MOD
it  >ARG1
possibly  >ARGM-ADV
cost  V01
?  

Not  
only  
am  
I  >>ARG2
being  V03
bilked  V01
for  
money  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
owe  V01
,  
the  
office  
staff  >>ARG0
is  V01
rude  V01
to  
boot  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
this  
office  >>ARG1
has  VLV
some  
serious  >ARGM-ADJ
billing  
practice  >ARG0
issues  V02
!  

We  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
blessed  V01
to  
find  V01
Elite  
Flyers  <ARG1
online  <ARGM-LOC
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
use  V01
anyone  <ARG1
else  
to  
handle  V01
our  
postcards  <ARG1
,  
posters  
,  
etc  
.  

We  >>ARG0
were  V03
looking  V01
for  
a  
company  <ARG1
with  
decent  
rates  
as  
our  
company  >>>ARG1
was  V03
just  >>ARGM-TMP
getting  V03
started  V01
.  

They  >ARG0
have  V03
the  
best  
rates  <ARG1
and  
GREAT  >ARGM-ADJ
customer  >ARG2
service  V02
.  

On  
one  
order  V02
,  
we  >ARG0
needed  V01
it  >>ARG1
rushed  V01
and  
shipped  V01
to  
a  
different  
state  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG0
did  V02
that  <ARG1
with  
no  
problem  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
appreciate  V02
their  
honesty  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
sent  V01
a  
graphic  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V03
distorted  V01
if  
printed  V01
as  
it  
was  V03
.  

They  >>>ARG0
called  V02
and  
worked  V01
with  
me  <ARG3
to  
fix  V02
it  <ARG1
so  
that  
it  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
look  V02
perfect  V02
.  

They  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
surprised  V01
me  <ARG1
a  
larger  >ARGM-ADJ
order  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
ordered  V02
1000  
postcards  <ARG1
,  
we  >ARG0
normally  >ARGM-ADV
order  V02
5000  <ARG1
or  
more  
.  

Because  
they  >ARG0
had  V03
room  >ARGM-ADV
to  
do  V02
5000  <ARG1
,  
they  >>ARG0
created  V01
the  
larger  
amount  <ARG1
,  
and  
shipped  V01
them  <ARG1
early  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
recommend  V01
this  
company  <ARG1
to  
ANYONE  >ARG0
and  
everyone  
that  >R-ARG0
needs  V01
great  >ARGM-ADJ
work  V01
done  VLV
at  
a  
reasonable  
rate  <<ARGM-ADV
!  

They  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
customer  <ARG1
for  
life  
in  
us  <ARGM-ADV
!  

sheisters  

i  >>>ARG0
made  VLV
the  
mistake  V02
of  
buying  V01
from  
these  
thieves  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
paid  V01
2  
k  <ARG1
cash  <ARGM-MNR
for  
a  
truck  <ARG3
with  
a  
blown  
motor  
.  

Their  
so  
called  
mechanic  >ARG0
said  V01
the  
engine  >>ARG1
was  V01
good  V02
and  
"  
There  
is  V02
nothing  <ARG1
mechanicly  
wrong  
with  
this  
truck  
"  
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
think  V01
a  
blown  
engine  >ARG1
falls  V04
under  
the  
catagory  <ARG2
of  
mechanics  
right  <ARGM-DIS
?  

Anyway  >ARGM-DIS
they  >ARG0
jimmy  >ARGM-ADJ
rigged  V01
it  <ARG1
so  
i  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
drive  V01
it  <ARG1
home  <ARGM-GOL
.  

The  
next  
day  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
took  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
2  
auto  
shops  <ARG3
and  
they  >ARG0
both  
told  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
same  
thing  <ARG1
,  
engine  >ARG1
is  V01
junk  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
called  V02
and  
got  V01
the  
same  
runaround  <ARG1
on  
hold  V03
and  
noone  >ARG0
calls  V02
you  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
.  

From  
a  
moral  
standpoint  
,  
you  
guys  >>>ARG0
are  V03
really  
gon  V04
na  
take  V01
2,000  
bucks  <ARG1
from  
someone  >>>ARG0
that  >>>R-ARG0
needs  V01
that  
truck  <ARG1
to  
work  V01
and  
support  V01
his  
family  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
know  V01
it  >ARG1
s  V01
just  <ARGM-ADV
a  
piece  <ARG2
of  
scrap  
metal  
?  

If  
it  >ARG1
lasted  V01
1  
month  <ARG2
i  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
suck  V02
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
but  
1  
day  
?  

Grimy  >ARGM-ADJ

My  
boyfriend  >>ARG1
and  
I  
were  V03
woken  V02
up  
in  
the  
middle  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
night  
at  
our  
campsite  <ARGM-LOC
by  
drunken  
kids  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
'd  V01
arrived  V01
around  
1:00  
am  <ARGM-TMP
and  
were  V03
drinking  V01
at  
the  
springs  <ARGM-LOC
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
complained  V01
to  
the  
management  V01
(  
as  
we  >>ARG1
were  V03
instructed  V01
to  
do  V01
if  
there  
were  V02
any  
problems  <ARG1
)  
,  
nothing  >ARG1
happened  V01
!  

Then  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
next  
morning  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG0
,  
among  
many  
other  
irate  
guests  
,  
asked  V02
to  
speak  V01
to  
the  
owner  <ARG2
,  
he  >>ARG0
refused  V01
to  
do  V02
so  <ARG1
.  

Not  
only  
that  
,  
but  
he  >ARG0
told  V01
us  >>>ARG0
,  
via  
his  
manager  <ARGM-MNR
,  
that  
it  
was  V01
our  
responsibility  <ARG2
to  
get  V26
up  
a  
second  
time  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
middle  <ARG2
of  
the  
night  
and  
call  V02
the  
night  
staff  <ARG1
if  
the  
problem  >ARG1
continued  V01
,  
even  
though  
his  
manager  >>ARG0
did  V02
nothing  <ARG1
the  
first  
time  <ARGM-TMP
to  
stop  V01
the  
kids  <ARG1
.  

Orr  >>ARG0
is  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
relaxing  V01
,  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
safe  
space  <ARG2
,  
and  
the  
owner  >>ARG1
is  V01
awful  V01
.  

To  
add  V02
insult  V01
to  
injury  V01
,  
he  >>ARG0
refused  V01
to  
refund  V01
our  
money  <ARG1
.  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
!  

FHS  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
good  
high  
school  <ARG2
--  
c  <ARGM-TMP
/  
o  
1998  

I  >ARG0
enjoyed  V01
my  
time  <ARG1
at  
Franklin  
High  
School  
.  

We  >ARG0
had  V03
relatively  
good  
facilities  <ARG1
at  
the  
time  <ARGM-TMP
--  
decent  
science  
labs  <C-ARG1
,  
with  
multiple  
hoods  
and  
access  V01
to  
good  
equipment  <ARG1
;  
nice  
gymnasiums  
,  
and  
a  
well  
-  
funded  
music  
department  
(  
I  >ARG1
was  V01
in  
the  
guitar  
ensemble  <ARG2
)  
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
,  
of  >ARGM-DIS
course  
,  
there  
's  V02
a  
new  
building  <ARG1
,  
with  
presumably  
better  
facilities  
.  

All  
to  
the  
good  
.  

For  
those  >>ARGM-ADV
who  >R-ARG0
care  V01
,  
a  
good  
proportion  >ARG0
of  
the  
my  
class  
went  V02
on  <ARGM-DIR
to  
4  
-  
year  
colleges  <ARG4
,  
many  >ARG1
of  
them  
ranked  V01
in  
the  
top  
50  <ARG2
of  
US  
News  
.  

If  
I  >ARG0
remember  V01
,  
students  >ARG0
went  V02
to  
Dartmouth  <ARG4
,  
U.  
Penn  
,  
Duke  
,  
BU  
,  
William  
and  
Mary  
,  
Vassar  
,  
Howard  
,  
and  
Carnegie  
Mellon  
,  
among  
others  
.  

Many  
students  >ARG0
went  V02
to  
Rutgers  <ARG4
,  
including  
their  >ARG0
top  >ARG2
-  
ranked  V01
pharmacy  
program  <ARG1
.  

The  
point  >ARG1
is  V01
--  
FHS  >ARG0
gives  V01
you  <ARG2
the  
opportunity  <ARG1
to  
make  V14
it  
to  
a  
good  
college  <ARG1
,  
but  
you  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
work  V01
hard  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Absolutely  
the  
best  
little  
motel  
on  
the  
coast  
!  

I  >>ARG1
've  V01
stayed  V01
at  
this  
fabulous  
little  
motel  <ARG3
two  
years  >ARGM-TMP
running  V13
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
say  V01
it  >ARG1
's  V01
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
lodging  >ARG1
experiences  V01
I  <ARG0
've  V01
ever  <<ARGM-TMP
had  VLV
on  
the  
coast  <<<ARGM-LOC
...  
and  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
even  >ARGM-ADV
comparing  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
the  
big  
resorts  >>ARG3
I  >>ARG1
've  V01
stayed  V01
at  <C-ARG3
!  

A  
large  
group  >ARG0
of  
my  
friends  
and  
I  
rent  V01
almost  
the  
whole  
motel  <ARG1
every  
year  <ARGM-TMP
for  
a  
weekend  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
the  
experience  V01
and  
stay  V01
have  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
been  V01
five  
-  
star  <ARG2
.  

The  
rooms  >>ARG1
are  V01
SO  >ARGM-EXT
clean  V04
,  
the  
managers  >ARG1
/  
owners  
are  V01
the  
nicest  
people  <ARG2
,  
the  
place  >ARG1
feels  V05
so  
homey  <ARG2
,  
and  
the  
location  >>ARG1
and  
grounds  
are  V01
beautiful  V02
.  

There  
's  V02
a  
restaurant  <ARG1
nearby  
(  
walking  
distance  
)  
with  
a  
great  
breakfast  
,  
and  
a  
market  
across  
the  
street  
.  

The  
motel  >ARG1
is  V01
very  
well  
maintained  <ARG2
,  
and  
the  
managers  >ARG1
are  V01
so  
accomodating  <ARG2
,  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
kind  
of  
like  
visiting  V01
family  <ARG1
each  
year  <ARGM-TMP
!  
;-)  

I  >ARG0
honestly  >ARGM-ADV
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
rave  V01
enough  <ARGM-EXT
about  
this  
place  <ARG1
...  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
really  <ARGM-ADV
a  
hidden  
gem  <ARG2
worth  
checking  V05
out  
!  

My  
favorite  
cuban  
cafe  
in  
Orlando  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
eating  V01
Cuban  <ARG1
for  
a  
long  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
sandwiches  
mainly  
along  
with  
other  
dishes  
..  

I  >ARG0
love  V01
Cuban  
coffee  <ARG1
,  
colada  
...  
mmmm  
anyways  
I  >>>ARG0
found  V01
this  
place  <ARG1
and  
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
stop  V01
going  V02
there  <ARG4
,  
I  >ARG0
stop  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
at  
least  
once  <ARGM-TMP
a  
week  
and  
anytime  
I  >ARG1
'm  V01
in  
the  
area  <ARG2
for  
a  
Cuban  
coffee  <<ARGM-PRP
or  
snack  
.  

The  
place  >>ARG1
is  V01
chill  V03
and  
comfortable  
.  

They  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
speak  V01
the  
best  
English  <ARG1
but  
enough  
to  
get  V17
by  
.  

They  >ARG0
bake  V01
bread  <ARG1
fresh  <ARGM-PRD
daily  <ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
press  V01
their  
sandwiches  <ARG1
which  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
way  V01
I  >ARG0
like  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
the  
meat  >>ARG1
is  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
fresh  V04
.  

They  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
great  
lunch  
special  <ARG1
with  
your  >ARG0
choice  V01
of  
meat  <ARG1
,  
chicken  <ARG2
,  
steak  <ARG2
,  
or  
pork  <ARG2
and  
rice  
and  
black  
beans  
and  
fried  
plantains  
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
their  
breakfast  >>ARG0
is  V01
awesome  V01
!!  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
describe  V01
how  
delicious  <ARG1
the  
mango  
and  
cheese  
pastries  
and  
the  
omelets  >ARG1
are  V01
to  
die  V05
for  <ARG1
.  

Stop  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
and  
have  VLV
a  
bite  V01
you  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
regret  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

A  
slice  
of  
heaven  
in  
winter

off

!  

highly  
recommended  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
going  V02
to  
Warner  
Family  <ARG4
for  
a  
number  <ARGM-TMP
of  
years  
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
anyone  <ARG2
.  

I  >>>ARG0
've  V01
read  V01
some  <ARG1
of  
the  
reviews  V01
below  <ARGM-LOC
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
state  V01
that  
yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
like  
any  
other  
doctor  
s  
office  >ARGM-ADV
there  
is  V02
sometimes  <ARGM-TMP
a  
wait  <ARG1
(  
depending  
on  
what  >>>ARGM-PRP
other  
patients  >>>ARG1
are  V03
being  V03
seen  V01
for  <C-ARGM-PRP
)  
and  
some  >>>ARG1
of  
the  
tests  V01
and  
procedures  V01
that  >>R-ARG1
are  V03
ran  V01
can  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
costly  <ARG2
(  
just  
like  
they  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
for  
any  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
medical  >ARGM-ADJ
tests  V01
elsewhere  <<ARGM-LOC
if  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
insurance  <ARG1
)  
...  

I  >>>ARG2
have  V01
seen  V01
several  <ARG1
of  
the  
providers  
from  
the  
office  
and  
have  V01
not  >>ARGM-NEG
once  >>ARGM-TMP
been  V03
shown  V01
anything  <ARG1
but  
care  V03
and  
consideration  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
speak  V01
for  
them  <ARGM-PRP
but  
any  
tests  V01
or  
appointments  V02
they  >ARG0
recommend  V01
are  V01
probably  <ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
interests  V01
of  
us  <ARG1
(  
the  
patient  
)  
and  
you  >>ARG0
have  V03
the  
ability  <ARG1
to  
decline  V02
anything  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
they  >ARG0
suggest  V01
to  
you  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
personally  >>ARGM-ADV
have  V01
had  V03
wonderful  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02
and  
if  
you  >>ARG0
re  V03
truely  >ARGM-ADV
looking  V01
for  
a  
FAMILY  
practice  <ARG1
...  
Warner  
Family  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
place  <ARG2
for  
you  
.  

Not  
what  >ARG1
i  >ARG0
expected  V01
!  

We  >ARG0
read  V01
the  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
reviews  V01
before  
going  V02
and  
had  VLV
high  >ARGM-MNR
hopes  V01
..  
but  
to  
our  
dismay  >>ARGM-ADV
it  >>ARG1
did  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
turn  V11
out  
that  
way  V01
!  

~  
It  >>>ARG1
took  V10
over  
40  
mins  <ARG1
to  
be  V03
taken  V01
to  
our  
table  <ARG3
,  
once  
there  >ARGM-TMP
it  
took  V10
another  
20  
mins  <ARG1
to  
get  V01
our  >ARG0
orders  V02
and  
a  
further  
45  
mins  
till  
our  
starters  >ARG1
landed  V01
on  
our  
table  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Very  
frustrating  
for  
a  
restaurant  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
has  V03
1  
rosette  <ARG1
and  
is  V01
supposedly  <ARGM-ADV
renowned  <ARG2
for  
the  
service  V02
...  
hmm  
There  
was  V02
no  
canape's  >ARG0
or  
amuse  
to  
keep  V02
us  <ARG1
occupied  <ARG2
,  
once  
we  >ARG0
complained  V01
about  
the  
wait  <ARG1
they  >ARG0
took  V01
us  <ARG3
something  >ARG1
to  
nibble  V01
on  <C-ARG1
but  
that  >ARG0
took  V10
us  >>ARG0
getting  V05
out  <ARGM-PRD
our  
chairs  <ARG1
and  
wondering  V01
round  <ARG1
to  
do  V02
that  <ARG1
and  
it  
was  V01
impossible  V01
to  
get  V01
anyone  >ARG0
s  
attention  V02
.  

Scallops  >ARG1
were  V01
overcooked  <ARG2
and  
the  
foie  
gras  >>ARG1
was  V01
cold  V01
but  
the  
rest  >>ARG1
of  
the  
food  
was  V01
lovely  V01
.

your  
dish  <ARGM-LOC

Customer  >ARG2
Service  V02

It  >ARG1
was  V01
my  
birthday  <ARG2
and  
I  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
last  
minute  
idea  <ARG1
to  
have  V03
a  
bakery  
cake  <ARG1
instead  
of  
one  >ARG1
pre-made  V01
in  
a  
convenience  
store  <ARGM-LOC
,  
but  
the  
problem  >ARG1
was  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
day  <ARG2
before  
Valentine  
s  
and  
when  >ARGM-TMP
many  
bakeries  >ARG0
turned  V05
me  <ARG1
down  <C-V
for  
a  
plain  
vanilla  
rectangle  
cake  <ARGM-PRP
,  
Fiona  >>>ARG0
stepped  V01
up  <ARGM-DIR
to  
the  
plate  <ARG2
and  
was  V01
able  V01
to  
make  V01
a  
fantastic  
beautiful  
cake  <ARG1
.  

Not  
only  
did  
it  >>ARG1
taste  V02
wonderful  V03
,  
but  
the  
texture  >>ARG1
was  V01
unbelievable  V02
,  
the  
frosting  >>ARG1
was  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
overly  >ARGM-EXT
sweet  V04
to  
over  
power  V01
the  
cake  <ARG1
,  
and  
the  
cake  >>>ARG1
itself  
was  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
amazingly  >ARGM-EXT
soft  V02
,  
and  
fluffy  
,  
and  
just  >ARGM-ADV
perfect  V02
overall  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Although  
I  >>>ARG0
'll  
have  V02
to  
drive  V01
a  
little  
out  
of  
my  >ARG0
way  V01
to  
go  V02

to  
me  <ARG1
once  <ARGM-TMP
before  
that  <ARGM-TMP

my

DOCTOR  <ARG4
I  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
big  
baby  <ARG2
about

only  >ARGM-ADV
came  V01
because  
my  
boyfriend

It  >>ARG1
hurt  V01
very  
little  <ARGM-EXT
,  
felt  V05
more  
like  
pressure  <ARG2
than  
pain  
.  

What  >>ARG1
I  >ARG0
like  V01
most  <ARGM-EXT
about

that  
she  >ARG1

am  V01
SO  >ARGM-EXT
GLAD  V02
to  
have  V01
found  V01
Dr.  <ARG1
Liau  
.  

Now  >>ARGM-TMP

feel  V01
more  >ARGM-EXT
confident  V01
wearing  V01
my  
bathing  
suit  <ARG1
in  
the  
summer  <ARGM-TMP

An  
Asset  
to  
Richmond  

For  
a  
long  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
one  
big  
source  >>ARG1
of  
entertainment  
missing  
from  
the  
Richmond  >ARG1
City  >ARG1
Limits  V01
was  V01
a  
first  >ARGM-TMP
-  
run  V01
multiplex  <<ARG2
.  

Bowtie  >>ARG2
has  V01
filled  V01
that  
role  <ARG1
nicely  <ARGM-MNR
.  

The  
theatre  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
an  
old  
brick  
warehouse  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
a  
block  
away  <ARG2
from  
the  
Flying  
Squirrels  
stadium  
.  

The  
owners  >>>ARG0
of  
Bowtie  
manged  V02
to  
add  V02
something  <ARG1
new  
while  
preserving  V01
what  >ARG1
was  V01
already  <ARGM-TMP
there  <ARG2
.  

The  
theatre  >>ARG0
has  V01
greatly  >ARGM-EXT
improved  V01
the  
surrounding  
neighborhood  <ARG1
.  

There  
's  V02
plenty  <ARG1
of  
parking  V01
,  
and  
I  >>>ARG1
've  V01
never  >>ARGM-NEG
had  VLV
an  
issue  V02
with  
audience  
members  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
stop  V01
talking  V01
or  
answering  V01
their  
cellphones  <ARG1
.  

Best  >ARGM-ADV
of  
all  
,  
there  
are  V02
no  
ads  <ARG1
!!!!  
!  

Just  
previews  
and  
the  
main  
feature  
.  

Expect  V01
to  
pay  V01
full  >ARGM-EXT
price  V01
,  
and  
the  
theatres  >ARG1
themselves  
are  V01
on  
the  
small  
side  <ARG2
.  

But  >>>ARGM-DIS
if  
you  >>ARG0
like  V01
going  V02
to  
the  
movies  <ARG4
,  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
love  V01
Bowtie  <ARG1
.  

The  
mangers  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
play  V11
a  
classic  
movies  <ARG1
on  
Sundays  <ARGM-TMP
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
a  
beer  <ARG1
in  
the  
lobby  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
repeat  
customers  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
get  V01
discounts  V01
if  
they  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
member

A

.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
rent  V01
another  
machine  >ARG0
for  
like  
$  <ARG3
60  
that  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
it  <ARG2
a  
finished  >ARGM-PRD
look  V02
.  

So  
from  
$  
55  
to  
$  
260  
?  

Are  V01
they  >ARG1
serious  V01
?  

I  >ARG0
feel  V01
like  
they  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tell  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
pitfalls  <ARG1
before  
I  >ARG0
pulled  V01
out  <ARG2
this  
tile  <ARG1
and  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
that  
I  >ARG0
have  V03
no  
other  
options  <ARG1
they  >ARG0
want  V01
5  
TIMES  >ARGM-EXT
the  
price  V01
?  

Either  
these  
people  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
anything  <ARG1
about  
what  
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
renting  V01
,  
or  
worse  V07
-  
they  >>>ARG0
are  V03
bait  V02
and  
switching  V01
.  

One  >ARG0
suspects  V01
that  
earlier  
reviewer  >ARG0
works  V01
for  
another  
laundry  <ARG2
.  

Outside  >>>ARGM-ADV
of  
parking  V01
being  V01
at  
a  
premium  <ARG2
,  
especially  
on  
discount  
days  <ARGM-TMP
,  
The  
Laundry  
Tub  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
filthy  <ARG2
and  
it  >>ARG1
's  V01
no  >ARGM-NEG
smaller  V01
than  
any  <ARGM-CXN
of  
a  
dozen  
laundromats  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG1
've  V01
been  V01
in  <C-ARG2
.  

Yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
there  >>ARG1
are  V02
bigger  V01
,  
but  
bigger  >>ARG1
is  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
necessarily  >ARGM-ADV
better  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
availed  V01
myself  <ARG1
of  
the  
wash  V01
'n  
fold  V03
service  V01
,  
taking  V01
just  
about  
a  
year  
's  
worth  <ARG1
of  
dirty  
clothes  
in  <ARGM-DIR
and  
getting  V09
back  
neatly  >ARGM-MNR
folded  V03
,  
clean  
clothes  <ARG2
in  
clear  
plastic  
bags  
(  
I  >>ARG0
'd  V01
originally  >ARGM-ADV
brought  V01
them  <ARG1
in  <ARG3
,  
in  
six  
large  
yellow  
garbage  
bags  <ARGM-MNR
)  
.  

The  
cost  >>ARG1
was  V01
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
reasonable  V02
and  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
continue  V01
my  >ARG0
patronage  V01
of  
The  
Laundry  
Tub  <ARG1
in  
the  
future  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hurt  V01
any  <ARGM-EXT
that  
they  >>>ARG0
knew  V01
my  
name  <ARG1
by  
my  >ARG0
second  >ARGM-ADJ
visit  V01
and  
greeted  V01
me  <ARG1
warmly  <ARG3
then  <ARGM-TMP
and  
on  
my  >ARG0
third  >ARGM-ADJ
visit  V01
.  

Whereas  
my  >ARG0
answer  V01
to  
the  
question  V01
"  
Where  >>ARGM-LOC
do  V01
you  >ARG0
get  V04
your  
laundry  >>>ARG1
done  V02
?  
"  
used  V03
to  
be  V01
,  
"  
At  
the  
checkout  
line  <ARG2
at  
WalMart  
,  
"  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
honestly  >ARGM-MNR
say  V01
the  
answer  V01
now  >ARGM-TMP
is  V01
,  
"  
At  
The  
Laundry  
Tub  <ARG2

"  

Thank  V01
you  <ARG1
!  

I  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
took  V01
a  
rescue  
puppy  <ARG1
to  
this  
Clinic  <ARG3
and  
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
SHOCKED  V01
at  
how  
well  >>ARGM-MNR
Romeo  >>ARG1
and  
My  
family  
was  V03
treated  V01
.  

They  >>ARG0
worked  V01
around  
the  
clock  <ARGM-TMP
to  
ensure  V01
that  
my  
puppy  
life  >>ARG1
was  V03
saved  V02
.  

We  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
leave  V12
him  <ARG1
at  
the  
vet  <ARG2
for  
3  
days  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
told  V01
to  
call  V02
for  
check  
ups  V_
as  
often  <<ARGM-TMP
as  
I  >ARG0
wished  V01
that  
no  
matter  >>ARGM-ADV
how  
many  
times  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
called  V02
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
annoy  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

lol  >>>ARGM-DIS
They  >>>ARG0
where  V01
super  >ARGM-EXT
friendly  V01
towards  
us  <ARG2
and  
treated  V01
us  <ARG1
like  
people  <ARG2
not  
walking  V01
bags  <ARG0
of  
cash  
.  

In  
this  
day  >>ARGM-TMP
it  
s  V01
rare  V02
to  
find  V01
such  
wonderful  
people  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
CARE  V01
,  
Not  
the  
kind  
of  
want  V01
to  
make  V05
cash  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
strongly  >ARGM-MNR
suggest  V01
you  >ARG0
give  V01
them  <ARG2
the  
chance  V02
to  
prove  V01
to  
you  <ARG2
that  
not  
all  
people  >>ARG0
in  
this  
world  
are  V01
evil  V01
!  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
to  
another  
vet  <ARG4
as  
long  <ARGM-TMP
as  
I  >ARG0
have  V03
animals  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
live  V01
nearly  
two  
hours  
away  <ARGM-LOC
and  
yet  
I  >>>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
still  >>ARGM-TMP
make  VLV
the  
drive  V01
to  
see  V01
them  <ARG1
!  

In  
fact  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
look  V03
forward  
to  
taking  V01
my  
animals  <ARG1
to  
the  
vet  <ARG3
simply  
because  
of  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
my  
animals  >>ARG1
and  
I  
are  V03
treated  V01
.  

Okay  >ARGM-DIS
,  
here  >ARG2
's  V01
the  
scoop  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01
a  
regular  <ARG2
at  
the  
HH  
.  

The  
food  >>ARG1
is  V01
excellent  V02
,  
the  
serivce  >>ARG1
is  V01
horrible  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
they  >ARG1
're  V01
still  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
mindset  <ARG2
from  
when  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
was  V01
only  
smokers  >>ARG0
sitting  V01
around  <ARG2
and  
drinking  V01
...  
not  
in  
any  
hurry  V01
.  

In  
my  >ARG0
experience  V01
the  
food  >>>ARG1
has  V01
been  V01
excellent  V02
(  
for  
the  
most  
part  <ARGM-ADV
)  
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
bartenders  >>>ARG0
/  
waitresses  
definately  >ARGM-ADV
need  V01
to  
be  V03
re-trained  V01
(  
if  
they  >ARG0
ever  >ARGM-ADV
had  V03
any  <ARG1
to  
begin  V01
with  <ARG2
)  
and  
learn  V01
two  
things  <ARG1
:  
only  >ARGM-ADV
chat  V01
with  
customers  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
other  
customers  >>ARG1
are  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
impatiently  >ARGM-ADV
waiting  V01
and  
to  
look  V01
around  <ARGM-DIR
more  
often  <ARGM-TMP
to  
see  V01
if  
people  >>ARG1
are  V03
waiting  V01
.  

In  
some  
cases  V04
the  
result  >ARG1
is  V01
because  
of  
understaffing  V01
,  
in  
some  
cases  V04
the  
staff  >>>ARG0
just  >>>ARGM-ADV
does  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
care  V01
/  
know  V01
better  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-ADV
get  V01
something  >ARG0
to  
keep  V02
take  
-  
out  >ARG1
warm  V07
,  
so  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
room  
temperature  <ARG2
at  
best  <ARGM-ADV
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
get  V05
it  <ARG1
home  <ARG2
.  

You  >>ARG0
just  
have  V02
to  
know  V01
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
're  V03
getting  V04
into  <C-ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
go  V02
.  

Nice  
local  
pub  
,  
excellent  
food  
(  
especially  
wings  
)  
,  
and  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
if  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
limited  
amount  <ARG1
of  
time  
.  

Trust  V02
The  
Midas  >ARG0
Touch  V01

I  >ARG0
personally  >ARGM-ADV
trust  V01
this  
Midas  
store  <ARG2
with  
all  
my  
vehicles  <ARG1
,  
I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
going  V02
there  <ARG4
for  
years  <ARGM-TMP
&  
would  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
anywhere  <ARG4
else  
!  

the  
staff  >>ARG0
is  V01
very  
personable  <ARG2
&  
actually  >ARGM-ADV
care  V01
about  
the  
customers  
safety  <ARG1
rather  
than  
taking  V01
there  
money  <ARG1
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
however  <ARGM-ADV
a  
very  
busy  
shop  <ARG2
but  
there  
are  V02
appointments  V02
available  <ARGM-ADJ
&  
the  
staff  >ARG0
up  
front  
will  >ARGM-MOD
surely  >ARGM-ADV
make  V02
sure  V01
you  >ARG1
get  V10
back  
in  
a  
timely  
manner  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >>>ARG0
look  V01
at  
some  <ARG1
of  
these  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
comments  V01
&  
laugh  V01
because  
people  >ARG0
think  V01
that  
the  
world  >ARG1
revolves  V06
around  
them  <ARG2
!  

Like  
the  
girl  
with  
the  
fuse  
problem  
...  

Midas  >ARG0
has  V03
the  
most  
high  
tech  
equipment  <ARG1
in  
town  
&  
I  >ARG0
guarantee  V01
you  <ARG2
if  
they  >ARG0
told  V01
you  <ARG2
it  >ARG1
was  V01
electrical  <ARG2
then  >ARGM-ADV
in  
deed  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
s  V01
electrical  <ARG2
!  

maybe  >>>ARGM-ADV
you  >>>ARG0
should  >>>ARGM-MOD
understand  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
the  
world  >ARG1
works  V09
&  
realize  V01
you  >ARG1
are  V01
just  
like  
any  
other  
person  <ARG2
&  
not  >ARGM-NEG
put  V01
yourself  <ARG1
on  
a  
pedestal  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
continue  V01
going  V02
to  
Dave  <ARG4
at  
Midas  
because  
he  >ARG1
is  V01
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
most  
honest  
business  
owners  
in  
this  
town  
!  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
having  V04
your  
car  >ARG1
worked  V01
on  <C-ARG1
you  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
trust  V02
the  
mechanic  <ARG1
&  
this  
Midas  >ARG1
is  V01
truly  <ARGM-ADV
someone  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
trust  V02
!  

We  >>ARG0
decided  V01
to  
try  V01
this  
place  <ARG1
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
because  
we  >ARG0
noticed  V01
that  
it  >ARG0
had  V03
some  
interesting  
things  <ARG1
on  
the  
menu  <ARGM-LOC
aside  <ARGM-ADV
from  
the  
usual  >ARGM-ADJ
rolls  V01
--  
live  
scallop  
sashimi  <<C-ARG1
,  
duck  
breast  
nigiri  
with  
foie  
gras  
,  
panko  
mussels  
--  
but  
none  >>>ARG1
of  
these  
were  V01
particularly  >ARGM-ADV
great  V01
or  
worth  V01
the  
sticker  >ARGM-ADJ
price  V01
.  

Additionally  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
tried  V01
the  
Logan  
Circle  >ARGM-ADJ
roll  V01
,  
spicy  >ARGM-ADJ
crab  >ARG1
and  
tuna  
roll  V01
,  
and  
sweet  
potato  
tempura  >ARG1
roll  V01
(  
$  
15  
,  
$  
10  
,  
and  
$  
3.75  
respectively  
)  
.  

The  
sweet  
potato  
tempura  >ARG1
roll  V01
was  V01
actually  <ARGM-ADV
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
surprise  V01
:  
cheap  
and  
delicious  
,  
the  
only  
thing  >>>ARG1
we  >ARG0
tried  V01
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
was  V01
well  
worth  <ARG2
it  
and  
a  
great  
value  
(  
and  
I  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
vegetarian  >ARGM-ADJ
rolls  V01
)  
.  

The  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
rolls  V01
were  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
at  
all  >ARGM-EXT
special  V02
,  
especially  
given  <ARGM-ADV
their  >ARG1
pricing  V01
.  

The  
bottom  
line  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
the  
food  >>>ARG1
is  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
great  V01
and  
is  V01
relatively  
high  
-  
priced  <ARG2
.  

The  
service  V02
is  V01
solicitous  <ARG2
,  
the  
atmosphere  >>ARG1
is  V01
nice  V01
and  
mod  
except  
the  
out  
-  
of  
-  
place  
flat  
-  
screen  
TV  >ARG0
playing  V01
football  <ARG1
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
go  V02
elsewhere  <ARG4
unless  
the  
prices  V01
are  V03
cut  V02
.  

It  >>ARG1
's  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG
worth  V02
it  <ARG2
.  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
Expect  V01
Sleep  <ARG1
or  
Courtesy  

I  >>ARG2
was  V03
booked  V03
for  
2  
nights  <ARGM-TMP
at  
this  
hotel  
in  
Oct  <ARGM-TMP
2007  
.  

At  
3:15  
am  >ARGM-TMP
on  
night  
#  >ARGM-TMP
2  
,  
the  
fire  
alarm  >ARG1
and  
strobe  
light  
activated  V01
in  
my  
room  <ARGM-LOC
.  

These  >ARG1
are  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
household  
type  
alarms  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
sound  V03
off  
,  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
true  >ARGM-ADJ
audio  
/  
visual  >ARG1
experience  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
called  V02
the  
front  
desk  <ARG1
and  
got  V01
no  >ARGM-NEG
answer  V01
.  

After  
checking  V01
for  
signs  V07
of  
fire  V05
or  
smoke  
and  
seeing  V01
none  <ARG1
,  
I  >>>ARG0
decided  V01
to  
just  >ARGM-ADV
pack  V02
up  
and  
leave  V11
.  

The  
desk  
agent  >>ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
argued  V02
with  
me  <ARG1
,  
claiming  V01
that  
no  
such  
alarm  >>ARG1
had  V01
gone  V16
off  
(  
as  
if  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
make  V10
that  <ARG1
up  <C-V
?  
)  
.  

He  >ARG0
finally  >ARGM-TMP
admitted  V01
that  
only  
the  
4  
ADA  
room  
alarms  >>ARG1
had  V01
sounded  V02
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
only  
4  
guests  >>ARG1
were  V03
effected  V01
(  
no  >ARGM-NEG
big  >ARGM-ADJ
deal  V03
to  
him  <ARGM-GOL
)  
.  

This  
little  
drip  >>>ARG0
offered  V01
no  >ARGM-NEG
apologies  V01
whatsoever  <ARGM-ADV
,  
and  
even  >ARGM-ADV
refused  V01
to  
give  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
name  <ARG1
of  
the  
manager  
until  
I  >ARG0
pressed  V01
him  <ARG1
for  
it  <ARG2
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
.  

This  
hotel  >>>ARG1
is  V01
adequate  V01
enough  V01
,  
but  
there  
is  V02
an  
obvious  
problem  <ARG1
with  
the  
staff  
and  
management  V01
.  

Do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
there  <ARG4
if  
you  >>ARG0
expect  V01
to  
sleep  V01
through  
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Poor  >ARGM-ADJ
Service  V02
,  
Lack  V01
of  
Passion  <ARG1
:  
Do  V01
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02

I  >>>ARG0
began  V02
seeing  V01
Dr.  <ARG1
Romanick  
back  
in  
2000  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
have  V01
seen  V01
a  
significant  
decline  <ARG1
in  
the  
quality  
of  
care  V03
,  
patient  
-  
doctor  >ARG0
communication  V01
,  
and  
just  
the  
overall  
level  
of  
services  V01
.  

The  
poor  
quality  >>>ARG0
starts  V01
at  
the  
receptionist  
desk  >>ARGM-LOC
,  
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
the  
staff  >>ARG1
is  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
impatient  V01
and  
lack  V01
the  
efficiency  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
once  >ARGM-TMP
loved  V01
about  
the  
office  <ARGM-ADV
.  

It  
took  V10
them  >ARG0
nearly  
two  
months  <ARG1
to  
complete  V01
a  
simple  >ARGM-ADJ
task  V01
,  
and  
countless  >ARGM-ADJ
calls  V02
from  
my  
part  <ARG0
due  
to  
their  >ARG0
lack  V01
of  
response  V01
and  
passion  
(  
not  
that  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
requirement  V01
for  
the  
job  <ARG0
,  
but  
it  
helps  V01
to  
at  >ARGM-ADV
least  
pretend  V01
to  
be  V01
helpful  V04
)  
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
promised  V01
to  
have  V04
my  
test  
results  >ARG1
emailed  V01
to  
me  <ARG2
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
never  >ARGM-NEG
happened  V01
,  
and  
after  
a  
few  >ARGM-ADJ
attempts  V01
to  
get  V01
Dr.  >ARG0
Romanick  
on  
the  
phone  <ARGM-MNR
to  
brief  V01
me  <ARG1
on  
my  
condition  <ARG2
,  
I  >>ARG0
finally  >>ARGM-TMP
gave  V08
up  
and  
went  V02
to  
a  
different  
doctor  <ARG4
.  

Please  >>ARGM-DIS
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
there  <ARG4
if  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
professional  >ARGM-MNR
,  
friendly  >ARGM-MNR
,  
diligent  >ARGM-MNR
medical  >ARG1
services  V01
you  >>ARG0
're  V03
looking  V01
for  <C-ARG1
.  

Save  V01
yourself  <ARG2
the  
trouble  <ARG1
,  
money  
and  
time  
and  
visit  V01
a  
more  
caring  
facility  <ARG1
/  
doctor  
.  

The  
moving  
company  >>>ARG1
is  V03
actualy  >ARGM-ADV
based  V01
in  
Brooklyn  <ARGM-LOC
,  
but  
advertised  V01
all  
over  
NY  <ARGM-LOC
/  
NJ  
,  
including  
Fort  
Lee  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
the  
guys  >ARG1
arrived  V01
(  
2  
hours  
later  <ARGM-TMP
than  
agreed  V01
)  
they  >ARG0
told  V01
that  
you  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
pay  V01
all  
the  
tolls  >ARG1
they  >>ARG1
payed  V01
coming  V01
from  
Brooklyn  <ARG3
and  
extra  
$  >ARGM-ADV
100  
for  
them  >ARG0
to  
drive  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
from  
your  
destination  
.  

That  >ARG1
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
in  
agreement  V01
eather  <<ARGM-ADV
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
realy  >ARGM-ADV
demand  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

And  
another  
$  
100  
for  
wrapping  V01
the  
furniture  <ARG1
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
totalling  V01
$  <ARG2
212  
just  
for  
start  V01
before  
any  
work  V01
started  V01
.  

Guess  V01
what  <ARG1
,  
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
in  
the  
initial  >ARGM-TMP
agreement  V01
as  <<ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

I  >>ARG1
was  V03
moving  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR
from  
2  
bdr  
apartment  <ARGM-DIR
and  
it  >ARG0
took  V10
for  
3  
strong  
guys  <ARG2
6  
hours  <ARG1
to  
load  V01
a  
track  <ARG1
(  
from  
2  
pm  <<ARGM-TMP
-  
8  
pm  
)  
.  

The  
only  
reason  >>ARGM-CAU
I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
giving  V01
3  
stars  <ARG1
instead  
of  
1  <ARG1
or  
2  
,  
I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
admit  V01
,  
nothing  >>ARG1
was  V03
broken  V01
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
can  >ARGM-MOD
recomend  V01
them  <ARG1
but  
prepare  V02
pay  V01
twice  
as  
much  <ARG1
as  
they  >ARG0
tell  V01
you  <ARG2
initially  <ARGM-TMP
.  

One  
more  
thing  
,  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
take  V01
any  
credit  
cards  <ARG1
or  
checks  
.  

You  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
pay  V01
CASH  <ARG1
ONLY  
before  
they  >>ARG0
start  V01
unloading  V01
track  <ARG1
on  
your  
destination  <ARGM-GOL
.  

Worst  
Apartments  
EVER  

We  >ARG0
lived  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
for  
2  
years  <ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
first  
year  >ARG1
or  
so  
was  V01
okay  <ARG2
.  

Then  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  >ARG1
more  
power  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
gave  V01
to  
Linda  <ARG2
,  
the  
worse  >ARG2
the  
place  >ARG1
got  V03
.  

We  >>ARG0
were  V03
always  >ARGM-TMP
having  V04
our  
water  >ARG1
shut  V04
off  
,  
there  
were  V02
always  <ARGM-TMP
people  <ARG1
having  VLV
parties  V01
at  
the  
pool  <ARGM-LOC
,  
even  
after  
it  >>>ARG1
was  V03
supposed  V02
to  
be  V03
closed  V01
.  

The  
pool  >>>ARG1
was  V03
supposed  V02
to  
close  V01
at  
10  <ARGM-TMP
and  
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
people  <ARG1
down  
there  <ARG1
until  
11:45  <ARGM-TMP
yelling  V01
,  
playing  V11
music  <ARG1
and  
do  V02
who  >ARG0
-  
knows  V01
-  
what  <ARG1
in  
the  
dark  
corners  <<ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
pool  
.  

Then  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG1
moved  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR
,  
we  >ARG0
cleaned  V01
the  
apartment  <ARG1
top  <ARGM-MNR
to  
bottom  
,  
they  >>>ARG0
came  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
and  
tried  V01
to  
charge  V01
us  <ARG2
for  
two  
cleaning  
fees  <ARG3
(  
and  
we  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
got  V09
our  >ARG0
deposit  V01
back  <<C-V
)  
and  
past  
utilities  >>ARG3
(  
that  >>R-ARG3
were  V03
already  >ARGM-TMP
paid  V01
,  
we  >ARG0
have  V03
check  
numbers  <ARG1
and  
records  
of  
this  
)  
.  

Linda  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
rudest  
person  >ARG2
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
ever  >ARGM-TMP
talk  V01
to  <C-ARG2
and  
she  >ARG0
sticks  V04
up  
for  
all  <ARG1
of  
the  
trashy  
,  
rude  
people  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
live  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
,  
not  
the  
nice  
ones  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
give  V16
a  
crap  <ARG1
about  
respecting  V01
others  <ARG1
.  

Do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
live  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
,  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
regret  V01
it  <ARG1
!  

The  
Worst  >ARGM-ADJ
Experience  V01
Ever  <ARGM-TMP
!!!  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
worked  V01
with  
Ted  <ARG3
Jurek  
at  
Decor  <ARGM-LOC
and  
You  
,  
and  
it  >ARG1
started  V05
out  
as  
a  
decent  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
.  

He  >>ARG1
was  V03
referred  V02
to  
me  <ARG2
by  
a  
friend  >>>ARG0
,  
who  >>>R-ARG0
did  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
have  VLV
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
with  
Ted  <ARG1
,  
but  
said  V01
that  
Ted  >>>ARG0
was  V01
able  V01
to  
make  V16
up  
for  
his  >ARG0
lack  V01
of  
preparedness  <ARG1
at  
the  
end  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
figure  V01
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
this  
company  <ARG2
a  
chance  V02
.  

However  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
after  
giving  V01
a  
required  >ARGM-PRD
$  >ARG1
500.00  
(  
NON  
REFUNDABLE  >ARGM-ADJ
)  
deposit  V01
before  
seeing  V01
any  
plans  V01
or  
ideas  
,  
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
sorry  V01
I  
did  V01
.  

We  >ARG0
met  V02
a  
couple  
of  
weeks  
later  <ARGM-TMP
,  
Ted  >>ARG1
was  V01
late  V02
.  

He  >ARG0
brought  V01
fabric  
books  >ARG1
,  
and  
pictures  
of  
furniture  
only  
,  
which  >R-ARG1
all  
came  V05
way  
over  
budget  <ARG3
.  

By  
the  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG1
got  V05
to  
the  
budget  >>ARG1
i  >ARG0
told  V01
him  <ARG2
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
work  V01
with  <C-ARG1
,  
there  
was  V02
basically  <ARGM-ADV
no  >ARGM-NEG
design  V01
.  

Just  
curtains  
and  
a  
couple  
of  
accessories  
.  

WHAT  >ARG2
IS  V01
THAT  <ARG1
?????  

This  
company  >>ARG1
is  V01
way  >ARGM-ADV
too  >ARGM-EXT
expensive  V02
with  
nothing  >ARG1
to  
show  V01
for  
it  <ARGM-PRP
.  

Please  >>>ARGM-DIS
everyone  >>>ARGM-DIS
....  
take  VLV
heed  V01
and  
do  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
get  V03
caught  V07
up  
in  
the  
hype  <ARG2
about  
DECOR  >ARG0
and  
YOU  
working  V01
with  
every  
budget  <ARG1
...  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
just  >ARGM-ADJ
a  
way  V01
for  
them  >ARG0
to  
squirm  V01
their  >ARG0
way  V01
into  
your  
precious  
pocket  <<ARGM-GOL

Horrible  
.  

Horrible  
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
walked  V01
in  <ARG2
,  
the  
person  >ARG0
behind  
desk  
said  V01
:  
"  
oh  >ARGM-DIS
well  
,  
you  >ARG1
must  >ARGM-MOD
wait  V01
,  
I  >ARG1
am  V01
in  
the  
middle  <ARG2
of  
something  
.  
"  

After  
a  
good  
few  
minutes  >ARGM-TMP
,  
he  >ARG0
asked  V01
:  
"  
what  >>ARG1
do  V01
you  >ARG0
want  V01
?  
"  

Somewhere  >ARGM-LOC
in  
between  
his  
rudeness  
he  >ARG0
asked  V01
if  
we  >ARG0
smoked  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
asked  V01
if  
this  
hotel  >ARG0
had  V03
smoking  
rooms  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
immediately  >ARGM-TMP
said  V01
"  
no  >ARGM-DIS
,  
there  
is  V02
a  
$  >ARG1
50  
deposit  V01
now  <<ARGM-TMP
!  
"  

Sure  
enough  >ARGM-DIS
he  >ARG0
charged  V04
it  <ARG1
to  
the  
credit  
card  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
inquired  V01
he  >ARG0
rudely  >ARGM-MNR
replied  V01
"  
in  
the  
morning  >>>ARGM-TMP
when  >>ARGM-TMP
things  >>ARG1
are  V03
checked  V05
out  
you  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
get  V09
it  <ARG1
back  <C-V
.  
"  

I  >ARG0
called  V02
customer  >ARG2
service  V02
about  
it  <<ARGM-PRP
because  
the  
website  >ARG0
specifically  >ARGM-MNR
states  V01
that  
there  
are  V02
no  >ARGM-NEG
other  >ARGM-ADJ
charges  V01
at  
the  
check  
-  
in  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
mentioned  V01
to  
the  
reception  
person  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
responded  V01
"  
we  >ARG0
have  V03
problem  <ARG1
with  
'  
people  
'  
"  
.  

Imagine  V01
a  
hotel  >ARG0
having  V03
problems  <ARG1
with  
people  
.  

I  >ARG0
finally  >ARGM-TMP
alerted  V01
him  <ARG1
to  
his  
rudeness  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG0
said  V01
he  >>ARG0
's  V03
had  V03
a  
long  
and  
bad  
day  <ARG1
.  

We  >>>ARG0
had  V03
no  >ARGM-NEG
choice  V01
but  
to  
stay  V01
but  
will  >ARGM-MOD
take  V01
this  <ARG1
as  
far  <ARGM-ADV
as  
we  
can  
.  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
stay  V01
there  <ARG3
.  

I  >>ARG0
came  V01
to  
find  V03
out  
the  
person  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
hotel  
OWNER  <ARG2
also  <ARGM-DIS
.  

My  
friend  >>>ARG1
and  
I  
were  V01
to  
stay  V01
here  <ARG3
for  
a  
girls  
night  <ARGM-CAU
,  
catch  V04
up  
on  
our  
lives  <ARG2
evening  <ARGM-TMP
.  

We  >>>ARG1
live  V01
within  
20  
miles  <ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
hotel  
and  
wanted  V01
to  
get  V05
away  <ARGM-DIR
from  
our  
responsibilities  
for  
the  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Unfortunalty  
my  
husband  >>ARG0
and  
I  
had  V02
to  
put  V16
our  
13  
year  
old  
lab  <ARG1
down  <C-V
that  
morning  <ARGM-TMP
and  
we  >>ARG0
were  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
expecting  V01
this  <ARG1
.  

My  
friend  >>ARG0
called  V02
the  
hotel  <ARG1
to  
cancel  V01
our  
room  <ARG1
as  
soon  <<ARGM-TMP
as  
I  >ARG0
called  V02
her  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
said  V01
that  
we  >ARG1
were  V01
to  
be  V03
charged  V01
for  
this  
room  <ARG3
regardless  <ARGM-ADV
because  
we  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
cancel  V01
within  
the  
72  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
called  V02
them  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
a  
few  
hours  
after  
putting  V01
my  
Bodhi  <ARG1
down  <ARG2
and  
they  >ARG1
still  >ARGM-TMP
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
budge  V01
.  

Times  >>ARG1
are  V01
hard  V02
,  
I  >ARG0
know  V01
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
had  V03
no  >ARGM-NEG
compassion  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
called  V02
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
to  
talked  V01
to  
a  
manager  <ARG2
,  
never  
a  
call  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >ARG0
emailed  V01
4  
times  <ARGM-TMP
,  
never  
a  
response  V01
.  

In  
one  >>ARGM-LOC
of  
the  
emails  V01
I  >ARG0
attached  V01
the  
letter  >ARG0
from  
the  
Vet  
's  
that  >R-ARG0
expressed  V01
their  
sympathy  <ARG1
,  
this  
hotel  >ARG0
did  V02
nothing  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
emailed  V01
Mackinaw  
Tourist  <ARG2
and  
nothing  
.  

I  >>ARG0
am  V01
sure  V02
this  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
good  
place  >ARG3
to  
stay  V01
from  
reading  V01
the  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
reviews  V01
,  
but  
if  
something  >ARG1
unexpected  
happens  V01
in  
your  
life  <ARGM-LOC
,  
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
care  V01
.  

FANFUCKINGTASTIC  

Ok  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG1
am  V01
a  
New  
Yorker  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
has  V01
been  V03
going  V02
to  
school  <ARG4
in  
Oxford  <ARGM-LOC
,  
England  
.  

I  >ARG0
thought  V01
the  
UK  >>ARG1
was  V01
completely  >ARGM-EXT
devoid  V03
of  
good  
NYC  
style  
pizza  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
thought  V01
to  
get  V01
a  
decent  
pizza  <ARG1
the  
only  >ARGM-ADJ
way  V01
was  V01
at  
a  
fancy  
restaurant  <ARG2
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
get  V01
a  
whole  
pie  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
thought  V01
I  >>ARG1
would  
have  V02
to  
wait  V01
until  
I  >ARG0
went  V02
home  <ARG4
to  
NYC  
.  

Well  >>>ARGM-DIS
then  >>>ARGM-ADV
I  >>>ARG0
went  V02
on  
a  
trip  V03
to  
Glasgow  <ARG1
and  
was  V03
walking  V01
around  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
saw  V01
this  
place  <ARG1
and  
it  >ARG0
looked  V02
like  
the  
HOLY  
GRAIL  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
knew  V01
I  >>ARG0
had  V01
found  V01
the  
real  >ARGM-ADJ
deal  V03
,  
big  
pies  >ARG1
,  
sold  V01
by  
the  
slice  <ARGM-MNR
,  
with  
the  
pizzas  >ARG1
sitting  V01
under  
the  
glass  <ARG2
in  
the  
front  <ARGM-LOC
.  

They  >ARG0
have  V03
crushed  
red  
pepper  
flakes  <ARG1
and  
oregano  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
ordered  V02
a  
slice  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
tasted  V02
like  
I  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-ADV
flew  V01
back  
home  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >>ARG0
du  V01
n  >ARGM-NEG
no  V01
how  >ARGM-MNR
they  >ARG0
did  V02
it  <ARG1
,  
but  
Scottish  
friends  >ARGM-DIS
---  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
THE  
REAL  >ARGM-ADJ
DEAL  V03
.  

I  >ARG0
congratulated  V01
this  
establishment  <ARG1
for  
doing  VLV
the  
research  V01
on  
making  V01
NYC  
pizza  <ARG1
because  
these  
Scots  >ARG0
fcking  >ARGM-DIS
nailed  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

That  >>ARG1
being  V03
said  V01
,  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
how  >>ARG2
their  >ARG0
delivery  >ARG1
service  V02
is  V01
.  

They  >>>ARG1
might  >ARGM-MOD
want  V01
to  
change  V01
the  
name  <ARG1
to  
reflect  V01
the  
new  
yorkedness  <ARG2
of  
the  
pizza  
,  
scrummy  
yummy  >ARG1
sounds  V01
gimmicky  <ARG2
to  
me  <ARG3
.  

Good  
food  
,  
good  
wait  
staff  
,  
poor  >ARGM-ADJ
management  V01

We  >ARG0
visited  V01
on  
7/26/08  <ARGM-TMP
for  
dinner  <ARGM-PRP
We  >ARG0
received  V01
a  
gift  
certificate  <ARG1
for  
the  
Mama  
Mia  
's  
on  
Greenfield  
Ave  
.  

The  
food  >>ARG1
was  V01
good  V02
,  
and  
so  >ARG2
was  V01
our  
waitress  <ARG1
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
came  V04
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
pay  V01
the  
bill  <ARG2
up  
front  <ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
let  V01
me  >ARG0
use  V01
any  <ARG1
of  
the  
certificate  
for  
a  
tip  V02
(  
which  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
done  V08
with  
any  
other  
restaurant  <ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
gotten  V01
a  
gift  
certificate  <ARG1
for  
.  
)  

I  >ARG0
then  >ARGM-TMP
asked  V01
if  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
money  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
in  
cash  <ARGM-MNR
.  

The  
person  >>>ARG0
went  V05
to  
go  V05
check  V01
with  
the  
manager  >>>ARG0
,  
who  >>>R-ARG0
was  V03
sitting  V01
at  
a  
table  <ARG2
chatting  V01
with  
her  
friends  >>ARG0
who  >>R-ARG0
were  V03
eating  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Her  >ARG0
answer  V01
was  V01
short  V07
and  
manner  >ARG1
rather  >ARGM-EXT
rude  V01
.  

Sorry  
for  
interrupting  V01
I  >ARG0
guess  V01
.  

The  
cashier  >>>ARG0
was  V01
also  >ARGM-ADV
short  V08
,  
unapologetic  
and  
made  V02
me  >ARG0
feel  V01
as  
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
wasting  V01
her  
time  <ARG1
.  

There  
were  V02
no  
other  
options  <ARG1
available  
(  
I  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
brought  V01
my  
check  
card  <ARG1
to  
cover  V01
any  
overage  
cost  <ARG1
)  
and  
she  >>ARG0
rang  V03
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
and  
applied  V02
it  <ARG1
to  
the  
gift  
card  <ARG2
before  
telling  V01
me  <ARG2
about  
the  
tip  
policy  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
visiting  V01
Mama  
Mia  <ARG1
's  
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

There  
are  V02
other  
places  <ARG1
with  
food  
just  
as  
good  
with  
management  V01
that  >R-ARG0
values  V02
customers  <ARG1
and  
employees  
much  
more  <ARGM-EXT
.  

DINING  V01

ON  
A  
BAD  
NOTE  >ARGM-ADV
THE  
WAITING

NOT  <ARGM-NEG
ENJOYABLE  <ARG2

ENOUGH  
SEATS  
.  

ALSO  >ARGM-ADV

THERE  
SHOULD  >ARGM-MOD

BE  V02
PEANUTS  <ARG1
ALL  
OVER  
THE

.  

NEXT  >ARGM-ADV

THERE  
SHOULD  >ARGM-MOD
ONLY  >ARGM-ADV
BE  V02
ONE  
PERSON  >ARG0
BRINGING  V01
YOU  <ARG2
YOUR  
FOOD  <ARG1
.  

IT  >ARG1
S  V01
NOT  <ARGM-NEG
A  
BIG  >ARGM-ADJ
DEAL  V03
BUT  
I  >>ARG0
HAD  V02
TO  
TAKE  V01
MY  
SALAD  <ARG1
HOME  <ARG3
BECAUSE  
THEY  >>ARG0
FORGOT  V01
TO  
BRING  V01
IT  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
HAD  V02
TO  
ASK  V01
THE  
GIRL  >ARG0
WHO  >R-ARG0
BROUGHT  V01
MY  
FOOD  <ARG1
AND  
SHE  >>ARG0
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
CAME  V01
BACK  <ARGM-DIR
TO  
LET  V01
ME  >ARG0
KNOW  V01
.  

I  >>ARG1
HAD  V02
TO  
WAIT  V01
FOR  
MY  
WAITRESS  <ARG2
.  

WHEN  >ARGM-TMP
YOU  >ARG1
FIRST  >ARGM-TMP
COME  V01
IN  <ARGM-DIR
THE  
HOSTESS  >>ARG1
IS  V01
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
VERY  >ARGM-EXT
FRIENDLY  V01
,  
THERE  
IS  V02
JUST  <ARGM-ADV
A  
BUNCH  >ARG1
OF  
WORKERS  
STANDING  V01
THERE  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG1
WAS  V01
THERE  <ARG2
ON  
MARCH  <ARGM-TMP
6TH  
,  
2009  
.  

I  >ARG1
WAS  V01
ALSO  <ARGM-DIS
THERE  <ARG2
OF  
JULY  >ARGM-TMP
4TH  
2008  
,  
WHEN  >R-ARGM-TMP
MY  
DAUGHTER  
S  
BUFFALO  
WINGS  >ARG1
CAME  V01
OUT  <ARGM-DIR
WITH  
A  
FLY  
ON  
IT  <ARGM-MNR
.  

THE  
MANAGER  >>>ARG0
CAME  V01
OVER  <ARGM-DIR
AND  
SAID  V01
HE  >>ARG1
WAS  V01
SORRY  V01
AND  
GAVE  V01
A  
NEW  
BATCH  <ARG1
OF  
WINGS  
,  
HE  >ARG0
SAID  V01
WE  >ARG0
CA  >ARGM-MOD
NT  >ARGM-NEG
REALLY  >ARGM-ADV
DO  V02
ANYTHING  <ARG1
BECAUSE  
THE  
DOORS  >>>ARG1
ARE  V03
ALWAYS  >>ARGM-TMP
OPENING  V01
AND  
CLOSING  V01
.  

IN  
MY  
OPINION  >>ARGM-ADV
SHOULD  >>ARGM-MOD
OF  V01
JUST  >ARGM-ADV
TOOK  V07
OFF  
THE  
PRICE  V01
OF  
THE  
WINGS  <ARG1
FROM  
THE  
BILL  <<ARGM-DIR
.  

BUT  >ARGM-DIS
EVERYONE  >ARG0
HAS  V03
THERE  >ARG0
OWN  >ARGM-REC
WAY  V01
!!!!!!  

Mezza  
Luna  
FTW  
!  

their  
mezza  
luna's  >>ARG1
are  V01
deffly  >ARGM-ADV
better  V02
than  
the  
pizza  >ARG1
rolls  V01
.  

it  >ARG1
s  V01
like  
a  
pizza  >ARG1
roll  V01
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
toss  V01
ham  <ARG1
and  
cheese  
inside  <ARGM-DIR
.  

it  
seems  V01
like  
it  >>ARG1
s  V01
healthier  V01
too  <<<ARGM-DIS
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
s  V01
prolly  <ARGM-ADV
not  <ARGM-NEG
.  

also  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >>>ARG0
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
call  V02
em  <ARG1
ahead  <ARGM-TMP
of  
time  
,  
and  
then  
go  V04
to  
pick  V04
up  
ur  
food  <ARG1
,  
or  
have  V04
it  >ARG1
delivered  V01
**  
.  

that  >ARG0
cuts  V11
down  
on  
teh  
wait  
time  <ARG1
,  
cus  
u  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
other  
stuff  <ARG1
while  
u  >>ARG1
r  V03
waiting  V01
.  

it  >ARG0
usually  >ARGM-ADV
takes  V10
20  
mins  <ARG1
for  
a  
mezza  
luna  <C-ARG0
,  
as  
they  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
add  V02
pure  
delicious  
extract  <ARG1
to  
the  
mix  <ARG2
.  

their  
pizza  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
little  
salty  <ARG2
for  
me  <ARGM-GOL
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
s  V01
still  >ARGM-TMP
good  V02
.  

they  >ARG0
do  V02
that  
whole  
thing  >ARGM-ADV
where  >R-ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
sandwich  V01
the  
pepperoni  <ARG1
between  
layers  <ARG2
of  
cheese  
for  
+  
32  <ARGM-PRP
delicious  
.  

anyways  
,  
the  
mezza  
luna  
:  
you  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
try  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

it  >ARG1
runs  V03
you  <ARG3
about  
4  
bucks  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG0
deals  V02
crushing  
blows  V14
to  
hunger  <<ARG1
.

Edit  
:  
Living  V01
on  
campus  <ARGM-LOC
at  
Clarkson  
University  <ARGM-LOC
,  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
had  V04
food  >ARG1
delivered  V01
before  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

This  >ARG1
was  V01
back  <ARGM-ADV
between  
'05  <ARG2
and  
'09  
and  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
remember  V01
how  
many  
times  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG0
've  V01
had  V04
it  >ARG1
delivered  V01
.  

Perhaps  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
deliver  V01
anymore  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
the  
deliciousness  >ARG0
of  
a  
mezza  
luna  
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
warrants  V01
a  
pickup  <ARG1
.  

My  
2004  
x  
-  
type  >>>ARG1
was  V03
getting  V03
close  V10
to  
100,000  
miles  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
was  V01
time  <ARG2
for  
an  
upgrade  V02
.  

I  >>ARG0
sent  V02
my  
wife  <ARG1
and  
daughter  
over  <ARGM-DIR
to  
check  V05
out  
a  
pre-owned  
2009  
XF  <ARG1
.  

Michael  >>>ARG1
Chestney  
was  V01
very  >>ARGM-EXT
pleasant  V02
and  
patient  V01
with  
my  
wife  <ARG2
and  
she  >ARG0
suggested  V01
I  >>ARG0
go  V05
check  V05
it  <ARG1
out  <C-V
.  

I  >>ARG0
went  V02
in  <ARG4
later  <ARGM-TMP
that  
afternoon  <ARGM-TMP
and  
met  V03
with  
Michael  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
showed  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
car  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
interested  V01
in  <C-ARG2
and  
we  >>ARG0
took  VLV
a  
test  >ARGM-PRP
drive  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
loved  V01
the  
car  <ARG1
so  >ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0
began  V02
negotiating  V01
my  >ARG0
trade  V04
-  
in  <C-V
and  
the  
price  V01
of  
the  
09  
XF  <ARG1
.  

The  
entire  >ARGM-ADJ
negotiation  V01
took  V10
about  
20  
minutes  <ARG1
.  

Fair  
give  
and  
take  
on  
both  
sides  V01
until  
we  >ARG0
agreed  V01
on  
a  
deal  V01
that  >>>R-ARG1
was  V01
within  
my  
parameters  <ARG2
and  
was  V01
fair  V01
to  
both  
sides  V01
.  

10  
minutes  
of  
paperwork  
and  
I  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
owner  <ARG2
of  
a  
beautiful  
pre-owned  
09  
XF  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
purchased  V01
over  
15  
vehicles  <ARG1
(  
cars  
,  
rvs  
,  
and  
boats  
)  
in  
my  
lifetime  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
say  V01
the  
experience  V01
with  
Michael  <ARG1
and  
Barrett  
Motor  
Cars  
of  
San  
Antonio  
was  V01
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
best  
.  

Friendly  
,  
knowledgeable  
,  
and  
above  
all  
fair  
.  

That  >ARG1
's  V01
all  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
really  >ARGM-ADV
ask  V02
from  
a  
car  
dealer  <ARG2
and  
Michael  >ARG0
and  
Barrett  
hit  V01
all  
3  <ARG1
.  

Thanks  V01
for  
the  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
deal  V01
and  
the  
great  
car  
!  

Identity  
Theft  

Myself  
and  
my  
fiance  
's  
identity  >>ARG1
was  V03
stolen  V01
from  
the  
office  
staff  <ARG2
.  

We  >>>ARG0
were  V03
told  V01
by  
a  
detective  <ARG0
and  
asked  V02
to  
check  V01
our  >ARG1
credit  V01
for  
anything  <<ARG2
unusual  
.  

Luckily  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG0
caught  V03
the  
crooks  <ARG1
before  
they  >ARG0
did  V02
one  <ARG1
on  
us  
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
black  
female  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
use  V03
to  
work  V01
in  
the  
office  <ARGM-LOC
.  

She  >>ARG0
stole  V01
the  
information  <ARG1
and  
gave  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
another  
guy  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
did  VLV
all  
the  
work  V01
.  

The  
other  
guy  >>ARG1
was  V03
pulled  V05
over  
one  
day  <ARGM-TMP
and  
a  
cop  >ARG0
saw  V01
suspicious  
papers  <ARG1
with  
names  
and  
social  
security  
numbers  
on  
it  
.  

That  >ARG1
s  V01
how  >>ARGM-MNR
they  >>ARG1
were  V03
caught  V03
.  

They  >ARG0
both  
went  V02
to  
jail  <ARG4
and  
a  
new  
manager  >>ARG1
was  V03
put  V03
in  
charge  V08
of  
the  
apartments  <ARG2
.  

The  
apartment  >ARG0
across  
from  
mine  
belonged  V01
to  
a  
gang  <ARG1
of  
hookers  
.  

Nobody  >ARG0
lived  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

A  
girl  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
show  V02
up  
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
a  
guy  >ARG1
in  
a  
nice  
car  
would  >ARGM-MOD
show  V02
up  
.  

Short  
time  
later  >ARGM-TMP
the  
guy  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
leave  V11
,  
then  
the  
girl  
.  

My  
apartment  >>ARG1
was  V01
usually  >ARGM-TMP
quiet  V04
.  

I  >ARG0
lived  V01
in  
one  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
face  V01
the  
parking  
lot  <ARG1
.  

Parking  
spaces  >>>ARG1
are  V01
just  >>ARGM-EXT
big  V01
enough  V01
for  
a  
Mini  
Cooper  <ARG3
.  

It  
sucked  V03
having  V03
an  
SUV  <ARG1

If  
I  >ARG0
found  V01
a  
spot  <ARG1
,  
I  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
fit  V01
in  
it  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Gates  >ARG0
worked  V01
30  
%  <ARGM-EXT
of  
the  
time  
at  
best  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Bugs  >ARG1
were  V01
a  
small  
problem  <ARG2
,  
nothing  
too  
bad  
.  

The  
best  >ARG1
there  
is  V02
in  
service  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
recently  >ARGM-TMP
traveling  V01
down  
I  
-  
24  <ARG1
from  
Nashville  <ARG2
with  
my  
3  
young  
children  <ARGM-COM
and  
had  V03
a  
blowout  <ARG1
on  
the  
southeast  
side  <ARGM-LOC
of  
Murfreesboro  
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
4:50  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
a  
friend  >ARG0
told  V01
me  >ARG0
to  
call  V02
Bud  <ARG1
,  
he  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
take  VLV
care  V03
of  
me  <ARG1
.  

Not  
only  
did  
they  >ARG0
answer  V01
the  
phone  <ARG1
at  
4:50  <ARGM-TMP
on  
a  
Thursday  <ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >>ARG1
hit  V01
the  
ground  <ARG1
moving  V01
!.  

They  >>>ARG0
tracked  V02
down  
the  
only  
tire  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
fit  V01
my  
BMW  
330i  <ARG2
in  
Murfreesboro  
within  
minutes  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
secured  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
then  >>>ARGM-TMP
they  >>>ARG0
came  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR
,  
took  V07
off  
my  
tire  <ARG1
(  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
runflat  <ARG2
-  
but  
runflats  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
you  <ARG2
any  
good  <ARG1
if  
they  >ARG1
blow  V07
out  
)  
,  
and  
brought  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
their  
shop  <ARG2
to  
change  V01
the  
tire  <ARG1
.  

They  >>>ARG0
were  V01
back  <ARG2
quickly  <ARGM-ADV
considering  V02
how  
far  >ARG2
outside  
of  
Murfreesboro  
we  >ARG1
were  V01
and  
had  V04
us  <ARG1
on  
our  >ARG0
way  V01
by  
6:30  <<ARGM-TMP
that  
evening  
.  

Thanks  V01
Bud  <ARGM-DIS
for  
all  <ARG2
of  
your  >ARG0
help  V01
and  
taking  V05
time  <ARG1
away  <C-V
from  
your  
family  <ARGM-LOC
that  
evening  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
without  
a  
doubt  V01
,  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
service  >ARG1
experience  V01
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had  V03
and  
just  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
be  V01
clear  V06
,  
the  
price  V01
he  >ARG0
charged  V01
me  <ARG2
was  V01
the  
same  <ARG2
as  
my  
tire  
guy  >ARG0
in  
Nashville  
's  
price  V01
for  
putting  V01
on  <ARG2
the  
other  
rear  
tire  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
hope  V01
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
return  V02
the  
favor  <ARG1
in  
the  
future  <ARGM-TMP
!

Service  V01
and  
Client  
base  
not  
ok  
.  

I  >>ARG1
have  V01
stayed  V01
in  
this  
hotel  <ARG3
many  
times  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
while  
it  >ARG0
typically  >ARGM-ADV
offers  V01
a  
decent  
bang  <ARG1
for  
the  
buck  
,  
its  
client  
base  >ARG1
largely  >ARGM-EXT
consists  V01
of  
troubled  
youngsteers  <ARG2
and  
evictees  
from  
the  
local  
,  
not  
so  
pleasant  
hood  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
considered  V01
this  <ARG1
a  
real  
problem  <ARG1
as  
I  >>ARG0
travel  V01
without  
kids  <ARGM-COM
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
fend  V01
for  
myself  <ARG1
,  
but  
when  
I  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
listen  V01
to  
a  
(  
non-violent  >ARGM-ADJ
)  
domestic  >ARGM-ADJ
fight  V01
that  >R-ARG1
lasted  V01
from  
1  
AM  <ARG2
to  
5  
AM  <ARG2
during  
my  >ARG1
last  >ARGM-TMP
stay  V01
and  
I  >ARG0
found  V03
out  
that  
the  
front  
desk  >ARG1
was  V01
unmanned  <ARG2
during  
night  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
,  
my  >ARG0
choice  V01
was  V01
to  
either  
waste  V01
tax  
payers  
money  <ARG1
by  
calling  V03
for  
a  
yet  
another  
police  
dispatch  <ARG1
to  
this  
hotel  
,  
or  
just  >ARGM-ADV
get  V03
over  
it  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG1
chose  V01
the  
later  <ARG1
,  
but  
approached  V01
the  
front  
desk  <ARG2
about  
the  
hotel  
policy  <ARGM-PRP
to  
push  V01
over  <ARGM-DIR
their  
responsibilities  <ARG1
on  
local  
authorities  <ARG2
,  
not  
to  
mention  
the  
good  
night  
s  
sleep  >>>ARG1
i  >>>ARG0
paid  V01
for  <C-ARG3
but  
did  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
.  

I  >>ARG2
was  V03
told  V01
management  V01
would  >ARGM-MOD
call  V02
me  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-PRD
but  
still  >ARGM-TMP
waiting  V01
for  
that  
call  V02
.  

I  >>>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
stay  V01
here  <ARG3
again  <ARGM-TMP
because  
it  >>ARG1
s  V01
cheap  V02
and  
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
afford  V01
a  
better  
hotel  <ARG1
,  
but  
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
look  V03
forward  
to  
it  <ARG1
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG
recommend  V01
this  
hotel  <ARG1
for  
families  <ARG2
or  
single  
female  
travellers  
.  

Was  V01
there  <ARG2
this  
past  
weekend  <ARGM-TMP
and  
the  
guy  >ARG0
behind  
the  
counter  
yelled  V01
at  
me  <ARG2
and  
my  
son  
because  
we  >ARG0
believed  V01
he  >ARG0
left  V12
the  
grandma  
slice  <ARG1
in  
the  
oven  <ARG2
a  
little  
too  
long  <ARGM-TMP
and  
the  
cheese  
got  V03
all  
dried  
out  
and  
the  
slice  >ARG1
tasted  V02
more  
like  
a  
cracker  <ARG2
.  

He  >>>ARG0
preceded  V01
to  
grab  V01
the  
slice  <ARG1
off  
the  
countertop  <ARGM-LOC
and  
throw  V01
it  <ARG1
into  
the  
trash  <ARG2
while  
yelling  V01
at  
me  <ARG2
saying  V01
,  
"  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
order  V02
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
about  <C-ARG1
"  
and  
"  
you  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
how  >>ARGM-MNR
pizza  >>ARG1
is  V03
made  V01
"  
.  

It  
was  V01
very  
upsetting  <ARG2
to  
see  V01
this  
kind  <ARG1
of  
behavior  
especially  
in  
front  <ARGM-LOC
of  
my  
four  
year  
old  
.  

He  >ARG1
was  V01
in  
the  
process  V02
of  
making  V01
me  <ARG3
a  
pie  <ARG1
and  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG1
got  V05
home  <ARG2
,  
the  
pie  >>ARG1
was  V01
the  
worst  V07
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
seen  V01
.  

Cheese  >>ARG1
was  V03
falling  V01
off  <ARGM-DIR
,  
so  
oily  
and  
greasy  
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
he  >ARG0
did  V02
it  <ARG1
on  
purpose  <ARGM-MNR
because  
of  
my  >ARG0
simple  >ARGM-ADJ
request  V01
for  
another  
slice  >>ARG1
of  
grandma  
that  >>R-ARG1
was  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
so  >ARGM-EXT
well  >ARGM-MNR
-  
done  V08
(  
actually  
,  
burnt  
)  
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
back  <ARG4
to  
this  
place  
and  
I  >>ARG0
am  V03
reporting  V01
them  <ARG1
to  
the  
better  
business  
bureau  <ARG2
for  
such  >ARGM-EXT
horrible  >ARGM-MNR
customer  >ARG2
relations  V03
and  
basically  >ARGM-ADV
sabotaging  V01
my  
pizza  <ARG1
and  
taking  V01
my  
$  <ARG1
25  
.  

THIS  
STORY  >>ARG1
IS  V01
100  
%  >ARGM-EXT
TRUE  V01
.  

That  
little  
man  >>>ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
thinks  V01
he  >ARG0
invented  V01
pizza  <ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
kiss  V01

Long

Rules  V01
,  
Rude  
Staff  
,  
Ok  
Food  

The  
first  
thing  >>>ARG1
you  >ARG0
notice  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG1
arrive  V01
on  
location  <ARG4
is  V01
that  
the  
waiting  
line  >>ARG1
literally  >>ARGM-ADV
goes  V01
out  
the  
door  <ARG2
and  
spills  V01
into  
the  
parking  
lot  <ARG2
.  

A  
restaurant  >>>ARG1
with  
this  
many  
patrons  >ARG1
willing  
to  
stand  V01
in  
line  <ARG2
just  >ARGM-ADV
to  
order  V02
tacos  <ARG1
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
good  V02
,  
right  <ARGM-DIS
?  

I  >ARG0
mean  V01
,  
that  >ARG1
's  V01
the  
way  V01
it  >ARG1
works  V09
at  
amusement  
parks  <ARGM-LOC
:  
the  
longest  
lines  >ARG1
are  V01
at  
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
rides  V01
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
this  >ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
an  
exception  V01
.  

The  
staff  >>>ARG0
taking  V01
your  >ARG0
order  V02
and  
"  
waiting  V02
"  
on  
you  <ARG1
are  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
indifferent  V01
and  
have  V03
no  
sense  V01
of  
costumer  >ARG2
service  V02
at  
all  <<ARGM-EXT
.  

I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
gotten  V02
better  
results  <ARG1
talking  V01
to  
COMCAST  >ARG0
customer  >ARG2
service  V02
than  
with  
these  
folks  <<<C-ARG1
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
think  V01
about  
asking  V02
to  
speak  V01
to  
the  
manager  <ARG2
because  
this  
guy  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
and  
pardon  V01
my  
French  <ARG1
,  
a  
jerk  <<ARG2

If  
you  >>>ARG0
have  V01
gotten  V13
through  V_
ordering  V02
,  
dealing  V01
with  
the  
rude  
staff  <ARG1
and  
if  
you  >ARG0
followed  V02
the  
dumb  >ARGM-ADJ
rules  V01
,  
you  >>ARG2
are  V03
finally  >ARGM-TMP
presented  V01
with  
what  >ARGM-PRP
you  >ARG1
came  V01
for  <C-ARGM-PRP
..  
some  
tacos  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
are  V01
"  
ok  <ARG2
,  
"  
but  
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG
worth  V02
putting  V12
up  
with  
all  
the  
hassle  V02
.  

Save  V01
yourself  <ARG2
the  
trouble  <ARG1
and  
skip  V01
this  
place  <ARG1
all  
together  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
suggest  V01
you  >ARG0
go  V02
up  <ARGM-DIR
to  
Raging  
Taco  <ARG4

Raging

a

Wish  V01
this  >ARG1

in

We  >>ARG1

She  >ARG1
was  V01
dead  
on  <ARG2

this

wonderful  V03

do  V01

off  
by  
the  
one  
negative  >ARGM-ADJ

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
tell  V01
you  <ARG2
we  >>ARG1
were  V03
pleasantly  >ARGM-MNR
surprised  V01
--  
BT  >ARG0
has  V03
taste  
memory  <ARG1
and  
each  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
back  
the  
food  >>ARG1
was  V01
consistently  >ARGM-ADV
delicious  V01
--  
same  
dishes  >>ARG1
--  
were  V01
consistent  V01
.  

Our  
friend  >>ARG0
is  V01
a  
world  
traveler  <ARG2
and  
loves  V01
unpretentious  >ARGM-ADJ
dining  >ARG1
experiences  V01
and  
inspired  
food  
.  

This  
chef  >ARG0
knows  V01
what  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
is  V03
doing  V02
.  

Treat  V02
yourself  <ARG2
and  
go  V02
--  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
go  V02
back  <ARG4
!  

I  >>ARG0
am  V01
a  
business  
owner  <ARG2
in  
downtown  
Saratoga  
Springs  
and  
wish  V01
this  
restaurant  >ARG1
was  V01
in  
our  
town  <ARG2
!  

The  
affordable  
rent  >ARG0
makes  V02
it  <ARG1
possible  V01
for  
an  
inspired  
chef  >ARG0
to  
serve  V02
his  
high  
quality  
fare  <ARG1
at  
affordable  >ARGM-ADJ
prices  V01
!  

Unlike  
Saratoga  
.  

I  >>ARG0
rrly  >ARGM-TMP
seek  V02
the  
cehf  <ARG1
out  <C-V
to  
introduce  V01
myself  <ARG1
--  
but  
the  
second  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
went  V02
--  
i  >>ARG0
made  V01
a  
point  <ARG1
of  
asking  V02
our  
wait  
person  >ARG0
to  
introduce  V01
my  
friend  >ARG0
and  
myself  
to  
the  
chef  <ARG2
to  
tell  V01
him  <ARG2
just  
how  
good  >ARG2
our  
meals  >ARG1
were  V01
.  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
wait  V01
to  
go  V02
gain  <ARGM-TMP
.  

-  
R.  
Morris  
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
that  
the  >>ARG1
re  V01
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
good  V02
.  

First  >>>ARGM-TMP
of  
all  
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
call  V02
for  
an  
appointment  V02
they  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tell  V01
you  >ARG0
to  
call  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
a  
month  
later  <ARGM-TMP
so  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
then  >ARGM-TMP
make  V01
one  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
also  >>ARGM-DIS
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
tell  V01
you  <ARG2
that  
they  >>>ARG1
're  V03
going  V04
to  
mail  V01
you  <ARG2
an  
"  
application  V01
"  
to  
be  V03
admitted  V02
to  
be  V01
a  
patient  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
feel  V02
that  
the  
way  V01
some  
doctor  
s  
offices  >ARG1
work  V09
around  
here  <ARGM-LOC
is  V01
a  
little  
bit  >ARGM-EXT
absurd  V01
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
happy  V01
that  
these  
guys  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
those  
two  
things  <ARG1
in  
particlular  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Usually  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
seen  V01
the  
same  
week  <ARGM-TMP
or  
maybe  
the  
following  
week  
.  

The  
doctor  >>ARG0
did  V01
tell  V01
me  <ARG2
that  
my  
male  
pattern  
baldness  >ARG1
is  V01
due  
to  
my  
mother  
s  
father  <ARG2
because  
the  
gene  >>ARG1
is  V03
exclusively  >ARGM-ADV
passed  V09
on  
through  
maternal  
line  <ARGM-MNR
but  
that  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
common  >ARGM-ADJ
misconception  V01
(  
http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm  
)  
.  

In  
general  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
say  V01
that  
the  
staff  >>>ARG1
is  V01
attentive  V02
and  
nice  V01
.  

But  
then  
again  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
nice  V01
to  
them  <ARG2
so  >>ARGM-ADV
that  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V01
why  <ARG2
.  

Anyhow  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
after  
reading  V01
some  <ARG1
of  
the  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
reviews  V01
it  
seems  V01
like  
some  >>ARG0
of  
the  
other  
reviewers  
are  V03
expecting  V01
mircles  <ARG1
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
want  V01
miracles  <ARG1
you  >>ARG0
'll  
have  V02
to  
go  V02
to  
21st  
St  <ARG4
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
pretty  
typical  
primary  
care  
office  <ARG2
but  
for  
the  
area  >>ARGM-PRP
it  >>ARG1
's  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
good  V02
.  

They  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
certain  
things  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
are  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
annoying  V01
about  
other  
offices  <ARGM-ADV
.  

First  >ARGM-TMP
trip  V03
to  
Canada  <ARG1

I  >>>ARG0
recently  >>>ARGM-TMP
traveled  V01
to  
Canada  <ARG1
on  
business  <ARGM-MNR
and  
had  VLV
a  
most  
excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
work  V01
for  
a  
large  
retail  
company  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
expanding  V01
our  >ARG0
operations  V01
into  
Canada  <<ARG4
and  
had  V02
to  
travel  V01
to  
ensure  V01
all  >>ARG1
of  
our  
computer  
network  
equipment  
was  V03
installed  V01
properly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
on  
time  
.  

This  >>ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
tend  V02
to  
be  V01
a  
stressful  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
in  
itself  <<ARGM-ADV
let  
alone  
adding  V02
crossing  
boarders  <ARG1
for  
the  
first  
time  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
pleased  V01
to  
find  V01
my  >ARG1
accommodations  V01
and  
the  
hotel  
staff  
to  
be  V01
a  
very  
calming  
and  
comforting  
part  <ARG2
of  
my  >ARG0
trip  V03
.  

I  >ARG0
found  V02
the  
hotel  >>>ARG1
to  
be  V01
amazingly  >ARGM-ADV
clean  V04
,  
not  
to  
mention  
very  >ARGM-EXT
well  >ARGM-EXT
adorned  V01
with  
many  >ARGM-EXT
pleasant  >ARGM-ADJ
surprises  V01
.  

From  
my  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
encounter  V01
at  
check  
in  <ARGM-TMP
to  
my  
regrettable  
check  
out  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
found  V02
the  
staff  >ARG0
and  
facility  
to  
exceed  V01
my  >ARG0
expectation  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG1
completely  >>>ARGM-ADV
enjoyed  V01
my  >ARG0
whole  >ARGM-ADJ
check  >ARG1
in  
experience  V01
and  
was  V01
impressed  V01
with  
the  
friendliness  <ARG0
and  
professionalism  
of  
the  
staff  
as  
well  
as  
the  
accommodations  V01
themselves  <ARGM-PRD
.  

I  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
traveling  V01
in  
this  
area  <ARG1
in  
the  
future  <ARGM-TMP
and  
you  >>ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
assured  V01
that  
this  
experience  V01
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
helpful  V04
in  
my  >ARG0
choice  V01
of  
hotels  <ARG1
and  
Novotel  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
my  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
selection  V01
.  

Yes  >>ARGM-DIS
the  
parking  V01
can  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
challenge  V01
but  
being  V01
from  
NJ  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG1
am  V01
no  
stranger  <ARG2
to  
tight  
corners  
.  

Please  >ARGM-DIS
pass  V05
my  >ARG0
appreciation  V02
to  
the  
Staff  <<ARG2
and  
Management  V01
for  
their  
excellent  
hospitality  <<<ARGM-CAU
and  
good  
spirits  
as  
it  >>ARG0
helped  V01
make  V02
a  
stressful  >ARGM-ADJ
trip  V03
enjoyable  V02
.  

Favorite  
place  
in  
Tampa  
.  

Update  V02
:  
I  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
add  V02
to  
my  >ARG0
review  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
was  V01
just  <ARGM-ADV
in  <ARG2
last  
night  <ARGM-TMP
and  
had  V03
a  
chance  V02
to  
dine  V01
in  
their  
new  
dining  
room  <ARGM-LOC
.  

AMAZING  
!  

I  >ARG0
frequent  V01
this  
resturant  <ARG1
on  
a  
weekly  
basis  <ARGM-TMP
but  
usally  
only  
for  
lunch  
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG1
was  V01
in  
for  
a  
treat  <ARG2
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG1
was  V03
greeted  V01
by  
the  
friendly  
girls  >ARG0
at  
the  
counter  
who  >R-ARG0
asked  V01
if  
my  
wife  >>ARG1
and  
I  
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
sit  V01
in  
their  
"  
new  
"  
dining  
room  <ARG2
.  

Right  
away  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
told  V01
us  <ARG2
that  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
same  
great  
food  <ARG2
with  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
prices  V01
so  >ARGM-ADV
off  >ARGM-PRD
we  >ARG0
went  V02
.  

We  >>>ARG1
were  V03
greeted  V01
again  <ARGM-TMP
and  
sat  V01
promptly  <ARGM-TMP
.  

After  
looking  V01
at  
the  
menu  <ARG1
and  
seeing  V01
the  
new  
menu  
items  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
had  V03
,  
we  >ARG0
knew  V01
we  >ARG1
were  V01
in  
for  
a  
treat  <ARG2
!  

I  >ARG0
had  V03
the  
Chicken  
Parmesan  
Dinner  <ARG1
and  
my  
wife  >ARG0
had  V03
the  
Shrimp  
Scampi  
Dinner  <ARG1
.  

AMAZING  
!  

The  
portions  >>ARG2
were  V01
generous  V01
enough  <ARGM-CXN
that  
we  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
took  V01
some  <ARG1
home  <ARG3
!  

I  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
say  V01
the  
value  >ARG0
of  
this  
place  
always  >ARGM-TMP
amazes  V01
me  <ARG1
.  

It  
's  V01
nice  V01
to  
see  V01
that  
even  
in  
the  
economy  >>>ARGM-ADV
we  >>>ARG0
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
eat  V01
a  
place  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
has  V03
upscale  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02
,  
amazing  
atmosphere  
,  
and  
Incredible  
food  
,  
but  
not  >ARGM-NEG
break  V01
the  
bank  <ARG1
while  
enjoying  V01
it  <ARG1
!  

Bottom  
line  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
when  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
small  
privatly  
owned  
resturant  >>ARGM-TMP
like  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
tell  V02
that  
the  
owners  >>ARG0
and  
employees  
take  VLV
pride  V01
in  
their  >ARG0
product  <ARG1
and  
service  V01
.  

Well  
Done  
!  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
work  V01
and  
honest  
establishment  
!  

I  >ARG0
typically  >ARGM-ADV
have  V04
work  V01
done  VLV
on  
my  
Jeep  <<ARG1
at  
the  
dealership  <<ARGM-LOC
,  
but  
it  >>ARG1
is  V01
6  
years  >ARG2
old  V01
now  <ARGM-TMP
and  
getting  V03
charged  V01
dealership  >ARG0
prices  V01
just  >>ARGM-ADV
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem  V01
cost  >ARGM-MNR
effective  V04
anymore  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >>>ARG1
had  V01
tried  V05
out  
few  
place  <ARG1
around  
the  
area  
and  
had  V01
been  V03
ripped  V04
off  
a  
few  
times  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
had  V01
hear  V01
great  
things  <ARG1
about  
Phet  
and  
G&G  
Automotive  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >>>ARG0
decided  V01
to  
give  VLV
him  >ARG1
a  
try  V01
.  

The  
service  V02
was  V01
excellent  V02
and  
personable  
.  

He  >>>ARG0
checked  V05
out  
what  >>>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
needed  V01
to  
have  V04
done  V08
told  V01
me  <ARG2
what  >>>ARG1
needed  V01
be  V03
fixed  V02
before  
he  >>ARG0
did  VLV
any  
work  V01
and  
did  VLV
great  >ARGM-ADJ
repair  >ARG1
work  V01
.  

The  
price  V01
was  V01
actually  >ARGM-ADV
lower  V04
than  
what  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
had  V01
anticipated  V01
and  
used  
to  
compared  
to  
other  
places  
,  
plus  
he  >ARG0
showed  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
work  V01
he  <ARG0
did  VLV
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
came  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
to  
pick  V04
up  
the  
car  <ARG1
.  

Also  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
a  
week  
after  
the  
work  V01
,  
Phet  >ARG0
called  V08
me  >>>ARG0
up  <C-V
to  
see  V01
how  >>ARGM-MNR
my  
car  >>ARG1
was  V03
running  V01
and  
to  
let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
that  
they  >>>ARG0
had  V01
accidentally  >ARGM-ADV
overcharged  V01
me  <ARG2
for  
part  <ARG3
of  
the  
work  V01
and  
wanted  V01
to  
give  VLV
me  
a  
refund  V01
for  
that  
amount  <ARG1
.  

That  >>ARG1
is  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
unheard  V01
of  <ARGM-ADV
these  
days  <ARGM-TMP
!  

I  >>>ARG1
grew  V04
up  
in  
a  
small  
town  >>ARGM-LOC
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
you  >>ARG0
knew  V02
and  
trusted  V02
your  
mechanic  <ARG1
and  
was  V01
really  >ARGM-EXT
cynical  V01
about  
city  
auto  >ARG1
repair  V01
shops  <<ARG0
since  
I  >ARG1
moved  V01
here  <ARG2
,  
but  
Phet  >>ARG0
has  V01
shown  V01
that  
there  
really  >ARGM-ADV
are  V02
honest  
hard  
working  
mechanics  <ARG1
around  <ARGM-LOC
.  

He  >ARG1
is  V01
my  
mechanic  <ARG2
going  V02
forward  <ARGM-DIR
!  

Our  
company  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
high  
end  
designer  
handbag  
and  
fashion  
accessories  
company  <ARG2
,  
thus  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG1
are  V01
certainly  <ARGM-ADV
a  
niche  
market  <ARG2
.  

We  >>>ARG1
had  V01
been  V03
evaluating  V01
SEO  
providers  <ARG1
for  
quite  
some  
time  <ARGM-TMP
and  
finally  >ARGM-TMP
decided  V01
to  
take  VLV
the  
plunge  V01
with  
Stuart  <ARGM-COM
,  
and  
Ulistic  
.  

We  >>ARG0
made  VLV
the  
decision  V01
for  
a  
couple  <ARGM-CAU
of  
reasons  
.  

1  
.  
Social  
Media  
.  

We  >>ARG1
were  V01
familiar  V01
with  
Search  
Engine  >ARG1
Optimization  V01
strategies  <<ARG2
,  
but  
new  
nothing  
about  
Social  
Media  
-  
we  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
heard  V01
that  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
next  
big  
thing  <ARG2
.  

2  
.  
We  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
liked  V01
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
Stuart  >ARG0
sets  V02
defined  
objectives  <ARG1
and  
we  >>ARG0
meet  V03
once  <ARGM-TMP
a  
month  
to  
go  V26
over  V_
our  
Key  
Performance  
Indicators  <ARG1
.  

How  >>ARGM-MNR
has  V01
it  >ARG1
gone  V06
so  
far  <ARGM-TMP
?  

Well  >>>ARGM-DIS
we  >>>ARG0
have  V01
been  V03
working  V01
with  
Ulistic  <ARG3
for  
1.5  
months  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
have  V03
100  
people  >ARG0
following  V02
our  
site  <ARG1
on  
Facebook  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
our  
web  
site  >>ARG0
,  
www.designofashion.com  
has  V01
seen  V01
a  
3  
fold  >ARG2
increase  V01
in  
traffic  <ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG0
is  V03
significantly  >ARGM-EXT
beating  V03
our  >ARG0
expectations  V01
-  
SEO  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
process  V02
that  >R-ARG0
takes  V10
time  <ARG1
and  
to  
get  V01
results  <ARG1
this  
quickly  <ARGM-TMP
is  V01
exceptional  <ARG2
.  

We  >>ARG1
are  V01
absolutely  >ARGM-EXT
confident  V01
that  
Stuart  
's  
ethical  
and  
focused  
strategies  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
these  
trends  >>ARG1
continue  V01
to  
grow  V01
,  
and  
our  
business  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
reap  V01
the  
rewards  <ARG1
of  
this  
program  
.  

Finally  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
it  
must  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
said  V01
that  
Stuart  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
fantastic  
person  >ARG3
to  
work  V01
with  <C-ARG3
,  
because  
of  
his  
solid  
strategies  <ARGM-CAU
and  
equally  
as  
importantly  
because  
he  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
genuinely  
good  
person  <ARG2
and  
a  
great  
communicator  
.  

Excellent  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02
and  
quality  

I  >ARG0
had  V04
Hom  
-  
Excel  >ARG0
replace  V01
most  <ARG1
of  
the  
windows  
in  
my  >ARG0
Tampa  >ARG1
residence  V01
three  
years  
ago  <<<ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
excellent  
windows  >>ARG0
have  V01
performed  V01
without  
any  
problems  <ARGM-MNR
,  
but  
that  >ARG1
's  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
why  >>ARGM-CAU
I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
writing  V01
my  >ARG0
review  V01
.  

Three  
weeks  
ago  >ARGM-TMP
,  
burglars  >>ARG0
tried  V01
to  
gain  V02
entry  V01
into  
the  
rear  <ARG1
of  
my  
home  
.  

The  
intruders  >ARG0
slit  V01
the  
screen  <ARG1
of  
the  
window  
.  

Next  >ARGM-TMP
,  
they  >>>ARG0
tried  V01
to  
force  V01
the  
window  <ARG1
with  
a  
pry  
bar  <ARGM-MNR
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
to  
break  V01
the  
window  <ARG1
with  
a  
hammer  <ARG2
.  

The  
window  >>ARG1
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
break  V01
!  

My  
next  
-  
door  
neighbor  >>>ARG0
heard  V01
the  
noise  <ARG1
and  
turned  V13
on  
a  
light  <ARG1
,  
thankfully  >ARGM-MNR
scaring  V02
the  
two  
miscreants  <ARG1
away  <ARG3
(  
they  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
left  V18
their  
hammer  <ARG1
behind  <C-V
!  
)  
.  

I  >>>ARG1
called  V02
Home  
-  
Excel  <ARG1
the  
next  
day  <ARGM-TMP
to  
order  V02
a  
replacement  
screen  <ARG1
for  
the  
window  <ARG2
,  
and  
was  V03
happily  >ARGM-MNR
surprised  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
said  V01
that  
they  >>>ARG0
were  V03
n't  
even  
going  V04
to  
charge  V01
me  <ARG2
for  
the  
replacement  
screen  <ARG3
...  
that  
it  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
covered  V01
under  
their  
guarentee  <ARG0
.  

Lo  >>>ARGM-DIS
and  
behold  
,  
they  >>>ARG0
replaced  V01
the  
screen  >>>ARG1
(  
which  >>>R-ARG1
had  V02
to  
be  V03
ordered  V02
)  
yesterday  <<<ARGM-TMP
and  
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
charge  V01
me  <ARG2
a  
dime  <ARG1
.  

Their  
worker  >>ARG0
even  >>ARGM-ADV
cleaned  V01
3  <ARG1
of  
my  
windows  
and  
changed  V01
a  
lightbulb  <ARG1
for  
me  <ARGM-GOL
.  

In  
this  
day  >>ARGM-TMP
and  
age  
,  
it  
is  V01
so  >ARGM-EXT
rare  V02
to  
find  V01
a  
company  <ARG1
with  
such  
nice  
workers  
and  
such  
far  
ranging  
guarantee  
policies  
.  

I  >ARG0
rarely  >ARGM-TMP
write  V01
reviews  V01
such  
as  
this  
one  <ARGM-ADJ
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
deserve  V01
anyone  
's  
business  <ARG1
!  

Friendly  
staff  
,  
but  
definitely  
some  
problems  

May  
,  
2009  
.  

We  >>ARG2
were  V03
booked  V03
at  
the  
Sheraton  <ARG1
with  
a  
number  <ARGM-COM
of  
other  
out  
-  
of  
-  
town  
wedding  
guests  
.  

Got  V04
put  V01
into  
the  
wrong  
room  <ARG2
the  
first  
night  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
were  V01
quite  >ARGM-EXT
surprised  V01
to  
have  V04
someone  >ARG0
with  
the  
same  
room  
key  
trying  V01
to  
get  V05
in  
the  
door  <ARG2
at  
1:00  
am  <ARGM-TMP
!  

Next  
day  >>ARGM-TMP
got  V03
moved  V01
into  
another  
room  <ARG2
,  
on  
the  
same  
floor  
with  
other  
wedding  
guests  
.  

There  
were  V02
3  
adults  <ARG1
in  
our  
room  
but  
towels  
for  
only  
2  
,  
no  
linens  
for  
sofa  
bed  
.  

In  
the  
second  
room  >ARGM-LOC
it  
took  V10
3  
tries  <ARG1
to  
get  V01
all  
the  
towels  >ARG1
and  
linens  
we  >ARG0
requested  V01
.  

A  
package  >>ARG1
and  
some  
wedding  
cards  
were  V03
left  V12
in  
our  
first  
room  <ARG2
.  

They  >>>ARG1
were  V03
sent  V01
to  
our  
second  
room  <ARG2
and  
had  V01
been  V03
opened  V01
--  
the  
ribbon  
-  
wrapped  
present  <C-ARG1
,  
and  
all  
3  
envelopes  
.  

Security  >>>ARG0
in  
the  
hotel  
seemed  V01
to  
be  V01
excellent  V01
,  
but  
we  >>>ARG0
were  V03
never  >>ARGM-NEG
given  VLV
an  
explanation  V01
as  
to  
why  >ARGM-CAU
someone  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
open  V01
these  
items  <ARG1
.  

A  
mid-afternoon  
"  
fire  
drill  >>ARG0
"  
was  V01
disruptive  <ARG2
,  
putting  V01
everyone  <ARG1
out  
of  
the  
hotel  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
called  V02
the  
front  
desk  <ARG1
about  
an  
extremely  
boisterous  
crowd  <ARGM-CAU
in  
the  
hall  
outside  
our  
door  
quite  
late  
at  
night  
,  
it  >ARG1
seemed  V01
to  
take  V10
the  
hotel  
staff  <ARG2
quite  
a  
while  <ARG1
to  
quiet  V05
them  <ARG1
down  <C-V
.  

The  
staff  >>>ARG0
was  V01
friendly  V01
,  
especially  
the  
front  
desk  
female  
supervisor  >>>C-ARG0
,  
and  
seemed  V01
to  
want  V01
to  
help  V01
,  
but  
too  
many  
unusual  
things  >ARG1
happened  V01
to  
make  V02
us  >>ARG1
want  V01
to  
stay  V01
there  <ARG3
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Be  V01
Careful  V04
Of  
Who  >ARG2
Your  
Sales  
Guy  >ARG1
Is  V01

I  >>>ARG0
think  V01
this  
place  >>ARG1
is  V01
probably  >ARGM-ADV
really  >ARGM-EXT
great  V01
especially  >ARGM-ADV
judging  V01
by  
the  
reviews  V01
on  
here  <ARGM-LOC
.  

My  >ARG0
experience  V01
was  V01
awful  V01
though  <ARGM-DIS
.  

It  >>ARG0
ALL  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
do  V04
with  
the  
sales  
guy  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
was  V01
a  
young  
22  
year  >>>ARG0
old  
who  >>>R-ARG0
had  V01
admittedly  >>ARGM-ADV
only  >>ARGM-ADV
been  V03
working  V01
for  
2  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>>ARG0
was  V01
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
interested  V01
in  
the  
car  <ARG2
and  
very  
likely  >>ARGM-ADV
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
bought  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
but  
the  
sales  
guy  >>ARG0
I  >ARG0
dealt  V01
with  <C-ARG1
ruined  V01
the  
deal  V01
.  

Essentially  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
told  V01
him  <ARG2
I  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
trust  V02
him  <ARG1
cause  
he  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
car  
salesman  <ARG2
,  
but  
he  >>ARG1
got  V03
so  >ARGM-EXT
incredibly  >ARGM-ADV
offended  V01
at  
that  
statement  V01
that  
he  >>>ARG0
had  V02
to  
go  V05
cry  V01
to  
another  
salesman  <ARG2
and  
compose  V01
himself  <ARG1
before  
coming  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
if  
the  
kid  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
bad  
day  <ARG1
or  
what  
,  
but  
I  >>>ARG0
had  V02
to  
sit  V01
and  
apologize  V01
about  
nothing  <ARG1
for  
10  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
until  
he  >ARG0
dropped  V05
the  
issue  V02
.  

After  
that  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
tried  V01
to  
ignore  V01
his  >ARG0
lack  V01
of  
professionalism  <ARG1
and  
test  >ARGM-PRP
drive  V01
the  
car  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
played  V02
dumb  V01
and  
asked  V01
him  <ARG2
questions  V01
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
already  >ARGM-TMP
knew  V01
the  
answers  V01
to  <C-ARG1
and  
he  >ARG0
responded  V01
with  
half  
truths  <ARG2
and  
a  
few  
falsehoods  
.  

For  
instance  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
asked  V01
who  >ARG0
owned  V01
Mazda  <ARG1
and  
he  >ARG0
said  V01
with  
confidence  <ARGM-MNR
that  >ARG1
was  V01
GM  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
is  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
true  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
mean  V01
,  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
care  V01
if  
he  >>ARG0
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
,  
but  
if  
he  >>>ARG0
pretends  V01
to  
know  V01
and  
tells  V01
me  <ARG2
BS  <ARG1
to  
my  
face  <ARGM-MNR
,  
there  
's  V02
no  
way  V01
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V03
going  V04
to  
trust  V02
him  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
matters  >ARG1
turn  V01
to  
the  
price  V01
of  
the  
car  <ARG1
and  
financing  V01
.  

The  
Worst  
Chinese  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
Ever  >ARGM-TMP
Had  V03

This  >ARG1
is  V01
by  
far  <ARGM-ADV
the  
worst  
chinese  
food  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
had  V03
.  

The  
service  V02
stunk  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG1
called  V04
in  
my  >ARG0
order  V02
and  
upon  
arriving  V01
to  
pick  V04
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
,  
they  >ARG0
got  V04
my  >ARG0
order  V02
confused  V01
with  
someone  <ARG3
else  
s  
.  

They  >ARG0
helped  V01
about  
three  
other  
people  <ARG2
before  
they  >>ARG0
offered  V01
to  
help  V01
me  <ARG2
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >>>ARG0
also  >>>ARGM-DIS
got  V04
my  
friend  >ARG0
s  
order  V02
mixed  V02
up  
and  
wanted  V01
to  
charger  V01
her  <ARG2
$  
10  
more  <ARG1
than  
what  >>ARG1
she  >>ARG0
had  V01
wanted  V01
.  

She  >ARG0
asked  V02
for  
the  
dinner  
combo  <ARG1
and  
they  >ARG0
gave  V01
her  <ARG2
two  
dinner  
plates  <ARG1
instead  <ARGM-ADV
.  

We  >>>ARG0
were  V03
standing  V01
in  
the  
store  <ARG2
for  
20  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
to  
simply  >ARGM-ADV
pick  V04
up  
an  
order  V02
.  

Not  
to  
mention  
that  
the  
wait  
staff  >>ARG1
was  V01
about  >ARGM-EXT
as  >ARGM-CXN
pleasant  V02
as  
dealing  V01
with  
an  
angry  
bull  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
were  V01
abrasive  <ARG2
and  
rude  V01
-  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG1
were  V01
the  
ones  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
messed  V02
everything  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

We  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
throw  V06
out  
about  
80  
percent  <ARG1
of  
our  
meals  
because  
the  
food  >>ARG1
tasted  V02
so  >ARGM-EXT
horrible  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
how  >>ARGM-MNR
it  
is  V01
possible  V01
to  
make  V02
orange  
chicken  >>ARG1
,  
sesame  
chicken  
and  
kung  
pao  
chicken  
as  
well  
as  
cheese  
puffs  
taste  V02
THAT  >ARGM-EXT
bad  V07
but  
China  
Delight  >ARG0
accomplished  V01
that  <ARG1
.  

The  
only  
thing  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
was  V01
edible  <ARG2
was  V01
the  
steamed  V01
rice  <ARG1
and  
the  
vegetable  
lo  
mein  >>ARG1
was  V01
barely  >ARGM-EXT
tolerable  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
here  <ARG4
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Lucky  
Panda  >>ARG1
in  
Willis  
is  V01
a  
billion  
times  >ARGM-EXT
better  V02
in  
service  V02
and  
quality  
of  
the  
meal  
.  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
no  
idea  <ARG1
how  >ARGM-MNR
China  
Delight  >ARG0
won  V01
number  
1  
Chinese  
restaurant  <ARG1
in  
Montgomery  
-  
There  >ARG1
needs  V01
to  
be  V02
a  
recount  <ARG1
on  
that  
vote  V01
.  

Terrible  >ARGM-ADJ
Service  V02

One  
of  
the  
worst  >ARGM-ADJ
experiences  V01
I  <ARG0
've  V01
ever  <<ARGM-TMP
had  VLV
with  
a  
auto  >ARG1
repair  V01
shop  <<<ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
took  V01
our  
vehicle  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
for  
a  
repair  V01
to  
the  
air  >ARG1
conditioning  V02
.  

Approx  
4  
months  
later  >ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
compressor  >ARG1
went  V18
out  
.  

We  >>ARG0
took  V01
it  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-ADV
in  <ARGM-DIR
to  
have  V04
it  >ARG1
repaired  V01
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
less  
than  
a  
week  
later  >ARGM-TMP
the  
second  
compressor  >ARG1
went  V18
out  
.  

We  >ARG0
went  V02
in  <ARGM-DIR
for  
a  
third  >ARGM-ADJ
visit  V01
and  
they  >ARG0
fixed  V02
it  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
this  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
when  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
picked  V04
up  
the  
car  <ARG1
,  
the  
radio  >>ARG1
and  
clock  
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
work  V09
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
for  
the  
4th  
time  >ARGM-TMP
in  
5  
months  
and  
the  
third  
time  
in  
2  
weeks  
,  
we  >ARG0
brought  V01
the  
car  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
expressed  V01
our  >ARG1
discontent  V01
to  
the  
manager  <<ARG2
(  
that  >>ARG1
's  V01
right  V06
,  
the  
manager  
)  
,  
did  V01
he  >ARG0
say  V01
he  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
return  V02
some  
money  <ARG1
,  
did  V01
he  >ARG0
say  V01
he  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
a  
discount  V01
on  
our  >ARG0
next  >ARGM-ADJ
visit  V01
,  
did  V01
he  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
say  V01
"  
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
sorry  V01
"  
.  

Nope  
,  
none  
of  
the  
above  
.  

He  >>ARG0
stood  V01
there  <ARG2
and  
told  V01
us  <ARG2
how  >ARGM-CAU
he  >ARG1
was  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
at  
fault  V01
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
fault  V01
of  
the  
parts  
supplier  <ARG1
,  
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
we  >ARG0
imagine  V01
how  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
felt  V01
having  V02
to  
put  V01
another  
2  
hours  <ARG1
of  
work  V01
in  
the  
car  <<ARG2
.  

And  
what  >>ARG1
did  V01
we  >ARG0
expect  V01
...  
that  
he  >ARG0
bench  >ARGM-MNR
test  V01
every  
part  <ARG1
.  

At  
no  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
during  
the  
conversation  V01
did  
the  
words  >>>ARG1
,  
"  
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
sorry  V01
"  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
come  V01
out  
of  
his  
mouth  <ARG3
.  

I  >ARG0
,  
nor  
anyone  
else  
in  
my  
family  
,  
will  >ARGM-MOD
ever  >ARGM-TMP
go  V02
to  
Sun  
Devil  
Auto  <ARG4
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Well  
,  
unless  
of  
course  
the  
third  
compressor  >>ARG1
he  >ARG0
put  V01
in  
the  
car  <ARG2
goes  V24
out  
.  

Do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
use  V01
this  
company  <ARG1
!  

I  >ARG0
dropped  V03
off  
a  
sheet  
metal  
piece  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
needed  V01
copied  V01
due  
to  
th  
it  >>>ARG1
was  V03
needing  V01
to  
be  V03
replaced  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
asked  V02
if  
they  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
copy  V01
the  
piece  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
dropped  V03
off  
.  

They  >ARG0
said  V01
it  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
made  V01
exactly  
like  
the  
one  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
needed  V01
to  
replace  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG2
picked  V04
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V
when  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
finished  V01
and  
was  V03
charge  V01
30.00  <ARG1
.  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>>ARG0
got  V05
to  
the  
job  <ARG2
and  
tried  V01
to  
insert  V01
the  
new  
piece  <ARG1
of  
metal  
IT  >ARG1
WOULD  >ARGM-MOD
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
FIT  V01
!!  

I  >>ARG0
took  V01
the  
original  
piece  <ARG1
of  
metal  
and  
rigged  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
make  V02
due  <ARG1
since  
I  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
complete  V01
the  
job  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
took  V01
the  
receipt  <ARG1
and  
the  
metal  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
fit  V01
and  
asked  V02
Pomper  <ARG2
for  
my  
money  <ARG1
back  
.  

The  
girl  >>ARG0
at  
the  
desk  
was  V01
sooo  >ARGM-CXN
rude  V01
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
believe  V01
it  <ARG1
!  

She  >ARG0
told  V01
me  <ARG2
she  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
use  V01
the  
piece  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
returning  V02
and  
the  
company  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
only  >ARGM-ADV
put  V01
it  <ARG1
in  
the  
trash  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
return  V02
it  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
explained  V01
I  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
what  >ARG3
I  >ARG0
paid  V01
for  <C-ARG3
.  

She  >ARG0
asked  V02
me  >ARG0
to  
bring  V01
the  
original  
piece  <ARG1
back  <ARG3
and  
I  >ARG0
told  V01
her  <ARG2
I  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
use  V01
it  <ARG1
on  
the  
job  <ARGM-TMP
.  

She  >ARG0
told  V01
me  <ARG2
that  >>ARG1
was  V01
to  >ARGM-EXT
bad  V05
she  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
nothing  >ARG0
to  
help  V01
me  <ARG2
since  
she  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
use  V01
or  
resell  V01
the  
piece  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
said  V01
I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
going  V04
to  
trash  V01
it  <ARG1
also  <ARGM-DIS
and  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
I  >>ARG1
at  >>ARGM-ADV
least  
have  V03
a  
credit  V01
.  

With  
a  
smirk  >ARGM-MNR
on  
her  
face  
she  >ARG0
told  V01
me  <ARG2
NO  
MONEY  >>>ARG1
IS  V03
BEING  V03
RETURNED  V02
and  
THAT  >ARG1
IS  V01
THE  
WAY  V01
IT  >ARG1
WAS  V01
.  

DO  V01
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
USE  V01
THIS  
COMPANY  <ARG1
.  

There  
are  V02
to  
many  
people  >>>ARG0
that  >>>R-ARG0
need  V01
our  
business  <ARG1
to  
have  V02
to  
put  V12
up  
with  
this  
unfair  >ARGM-ADJ
treatment  V01
!!!!!  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
NEVER  >ARGM-NEG
recommend  V01
this  
gym  <ARG1
to  
anyone  <ARG2
and  
unfortunately  >>ARGM-ADV
this  >>ARG1
is  V03
based  V02
solely  
on  
the  
owner  
's  
own  
unprofessionalism  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
originally  >ARGM-ADV
joined  V04
in  
January  <ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
did  V02
so  <ARG1
because  
I  >>ARG2
was  V03
told  V01
I  >>>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
cancel  V01
the  
12  
month  
membership  <ARG1
if  
I  >>ARG0
was  V01
to  
move  V01
away  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >ARG0
signed  V03
up  
with  
one  >>ARG1
of  
the  
staff  
who  >>R-ARG1
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
pleasant  V02
and  
professional  
.  

Actually  >ARGM-ADV
working  V03
out  
there  <ARGM-LOC
was  V01
good  V02
-  
the  
machines  >>ARG1
are  V01
nice  V01
and  
the  
classes  >>ARG1
are  V01
fun  V01
.  

The  
locker  
room  >>ARG0
is  V03
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
lacking  V01
-  
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
never  >>ARGM-NEG
shower  V01
or  
change  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

They  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
update  V01
the  
locker  
rooms  <ARG1
ASAP  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Back  
to  
my  >ARG1
poor  >ARG2
rating  V01
-  
I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
excepted  V01
to  
medical  
school  <ARG3
and  
went  V02
in  <ARGM-DIR
to  
cancel  V01
my  
membership  <ARG1
as  
I  >>ARG2
was  V03
told  V01
I  
could  
do  V01
since  
I  >>ARG1
was  V03
moving  V01
away  <ARGM-DIR
.  

The  
owner  >>>ARG0
was  V01
VERY  >ARGM-EXT
rude  V01
,  
accused  V01
me  <ARG1
of  
not  >ARGM-NEG
reading  V01
my  
contract  <ARG1
,  
and  
basically  >ARGM-ADV
told  V01
me  >ARG1
to  
shut  V06
up  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
trying  V01
to  
ask  V01
questions  V01
to  
further  >ARGM-EXT
understand  V01
the  
process  V02
of  
canceling  V01
my  
membership  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
was  V01
able  V01
to  
cancel  V01
it  <ARG1
but  
only  
after  
paying  V01
a  
$  
50  
fee  >>>ARG1
(  
which  >>>R-ARG1
the  
staff  
person  >>ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
signed  V03
me  <ARG1
up  <C-V
stated  V01
I  >>ARG0
would  
not  
have  V02
to  
pay  V01
if  
I  >>ARG0
had  V03
proof  V01
of  
moving  V01
)  
and  
being  V03
spoken  V01
to  <ARG2
in  
a  
very  
belittling  
manner  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
understand  V01
if  
I  >>>ARG1
was  V03
being  V03
treated  V01
this  
way  V01
by  
a  
staff  
member  <<ARG0
but  
the  
club  
's  
actual  
OWNER  
?!  

Bad  
for  
business  
.  

I  >ARG1
was  V01
appalled  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
recommend  V01
this  
gym  <ARG1
to  
any  
woman  <ARG2
.  

The  
equipment  >>>ARG1
and  
classes  
are  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
good  V02
enough  V01
to  
deal  V01
with  
the  
rudeness  <ARG2
from  
the  
staff  
!!!  

There  
are  V02
better  
places  <ARG1
on  
the  
Cape  <ARGM-LOC
-  
FITNESS  
500  
!  

The  
Salon  >ARG1
Experience  V01
from  
Hell  <ARGM-ADJ

I  >>ARG0
feel  V01
obligated  <ARG1
to  
share  V01
this  
story  <ARG1
.  

Right  
out  
of  
college  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
called  V02
the  
salon  <ARG1
and  
explained  V01
my  
situation  <ARG1
.  

Just  >ARGM-TMP
graduated  V01
,  
just  >ARGM-TMP
moved  V01
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
rich  V01
,  
and  
starting  V01
new  
job  <ARG1
soon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
got  V01
a  
price  >ARG3
quote  V01
over  
the  
phone  <<ARGM-MNR
and  
they  >>>ARG0
take  V01
your  
cc  
info  <ARG1
just  >>ARGM-ADV
to  
make  VLV
the  
appointment  V02
because  
if  
you  >>ARG1
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
show  V02
up  
,  
they  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
charge  V01
you  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
had  V03
this  
ridiculous  
celebrity  
stylist  >ARG1
from  
LA  
named  V01
Derrick  <ARG2
.  

After  
he  >ARG0
already  >ARGM-TMP
put  V01
product  <ARG1
on  
my  
hair  <ARG2
he  >ARG0
said  V01
"  
I  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
warn  V01
you  <ARG2
,  
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
expensive  V02
.  
"  

What  >>>ARG1
was  V03
I  >>ARG0
supposed  V02
to  
do  V02
,  
say  V01
I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
afford  V01
you  <ARG1
and  
walk  V01
out  <ARG2
with  
crap  <ARGM-MNR
all  
over  
my  
hair  
.  

I  >>>ARG1
wanted  V01
to  
be  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
blonde  V01
and  
instead  >ARGM-ADV
he  >ARG0
pulled  V01
my  
root  
color  <ARG1
throughout  
my  
whole  
hair  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
a  
gross  
mousey  
brown  <ARG2
.  

The  
other  
stylists  >>>ARG0
around  
me  
kept  V02
pressuring  V01
me  <ARG1
saying  V01
he  >>ARG1
's  V01
so  >ARGM-EXT
wonderful  V03
,  
you  >>>ARG0
're  V03
going  V04
to  
love  V01
your  
hair  <ARG1
.  

$  
400  
later  >ARGM-ADV
my  
jaw  >ARG1
dropped  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
receptionist  >ARG0
told  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
total  <ARG1
.  

Derrick  >>ARG1
did  V02
a  
terrible  
job  <ARG1
,  
was  V01
a  
complete  
jerk  <ARG2
the  
entire  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
I  >>ARG2
had  VLV
no  >ARGM-NEG
warning  V01
as  
to  
the  
price  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
cried  V02
the  
entire  
way  
home  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >ARG0
then  >ARGM-TMP
"  
fixed  V02
"  
it  <ARG1
for  
free  <ARGM-ADV
but  
it  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
looked  V02
like  
crap  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
salon  >ARG1
experience  V01
from  
absolutely  
Hell  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
told  V01
me  <ARG2
that  
he  >ARG0
worked  V01
on  
the  
cast  <ARG1
of  
will  
and  
grace  
and  
that  
they  >ARG1
were  V01
all  <ARGM-ADV
jerks  <ARG2
.  

That  >ARG1
's  V01
my  >ARG2
favorite  >ARGM-ADJ
show  V04
of  
all  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
sure  V02
for  
the  
cast  <ARGM-GOL
that  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
other  
way  
around  <ARG2
.  

Maybe  >>ARGM-DIS
he  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do  V02
a  
good  
job  <ARG1
and  
they  >ARG0
told  V01
him  <ARG2
so  <ARG1
.  

Absolute  
Nightmare  
!  

STAY  V01
AWAY  <ARG3
!  

Very  
unhappy  
...  

Working  V01
with  
Rod  <ARG3
Jacobsen  
was  V01
my  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
experience  V01
working  V01
with  
a  
CPA  <ARG3
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
what  >ARG1
to  
expect  V01
.  

That  >ARG1
said  V01
-  
he  >ARG1
seemed  V01
to  
be  V03
doing  V02
well  
enough  <ARGM-MNR
.  

However  >ARGM-ADV
,  
then  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>>ARG0
asked  V02
to  
amend  V01
my  >ARG0
return  V02
to  
apply  V02
a  
credit  V01
I  >>>ARG1
had  V01
just  >>ARGM-TMP
become  V01
eligible  V01
for  <C-ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
expected  V01
to  
pay  V01
for  
this  
service  V01
,  
but  
imagine  
my  >ARG1
surprise  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
received  V01
a  
bill  <ARG1
for  
MORE  
than  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
paid  V01
to  
have  V04
the  
original  >ARGM-ADJ
return  V02
prepared  V01
.  

Asked  V01
why  <ARG1
,  
Rod  >ARG0
simply  >ARGM-ADV
told  V01
me  <ARG2
that  
he  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
research  V01
how  >>ARGM-MNR
to  
do  VLV
the  
amendment  V01
(  
it  >ARG1
was  V01
an  
amended  >ARG0
to  
show  V01
that  
I  >>ARG0
had  V01
purchased  V01
a  
home  <ARG1
-  
nothing  <<<ARGM-ADV
out  
of  
the  
ordinary  
,  
one  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
think  V01
)  
and  
that  >ARG0
took  V10
time  <ARG1
to  
figure  V05
out  
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
that  >ARG1
was  V01
strike  V11
one  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
n't  
going  V04
to  
use  V01
them  <ARG1
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
going  V04
to  
leave  V14
it  <ARG1
at  
that  <ARG1
.  

However  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
now  >>>ARGM-TMP
that  
I  >>>ARG0
have  V01
come  V04
to  
realize  V01
that  
I  >>>ARG0
am  V03
going  V04
to  
owe  V01
the  
IRS  <ARG2
$  <ARG1
6,000  
+  
despite  
doing  V02
exactly  
what  >>ARG1
Rod  >ARG0
told  V01
me  >ARG0
to  
do  V02
,  
I  >ARG0
feel  V02
I  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
voice  V01
my  
opinion  <ARG1
.  

Last  
year  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
after  
all  >>>ARG1
was  V03
said  V01
and  
done  V02
,  
I  >ARG0
asked  V01
Rod  <ARG2
whether  
my  
payment  
structure  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
leave  V13
me  <ARG1
with  
no  
/  
little  
tax  
liability  <ARG1
at  
the  
end  V01
of  
the  
year  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG0
said  V01
yes  <ARG1
.  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
again  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG0
am  V03
now  >ARGM-TMP
faced  V01
with  
a  
tax  
bill  <ARG1
of  
$  
6,000  
+  
,  
all  >ARG1
due  V03
on  
April  <ARGM-TMP
15  
,  
2010  
and  
all  >>>ARG1
that  >>ARG1
Rod  >ARG0
has  V03
to  
say  V01
to  
the  
matter  <ARG3
is  V01
'  
well  
,  
you  >>ARG0
wo  
n't  
have  V02
to  
pay  V01
a  
penalty  <ARG1
.  
'  

I  >>ARG0
may  
not  
have  V02
to  
pay  V01
a  
penalty  <ARG1
,  
yet  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
NOT  <ARGM-NEG
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
had  V03
in  
mind  <ARGM-LOC
when  >ARGM-TMP
hired  V01
these  
guys  <ARG1
.  

In  
the  
words  >ARGM-ADV
of  
my  
new  
accountant  
,  
THEY  >ARG0
LET  V04
ME  <ARG1
DOWN  <C-V
!  

Bit  
sketchy  
,  
sporadic  
delivery  
times  

I  >ARG0
bought  V01
about  
half  <ARG1
of  
the  
furniture  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
own  V01
from  
this  
place  <<ARG2
.  

Why  
?  

Because  
they  >ARG0
cut  V03
me  <ARGM-GOL
good  >ARGM-ADJ
deals  V01
if  
I  >ARG0
paid  V01
in  
cash  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Sketchy  
,  
right  
?  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG0
came  V17
through  
and  
delivered  V01
almost  
all  <ARG1
of  
my  
items  
within  
a  
few  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

(  
They  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
got  V01
me  <ARG4
a  
couch  <ARG1
pretty  
quickly  <ARGM-TMP
.  
)  

The  
guy  >>>ARG1
who  >>>R-ARG0
was  V03
cutting  V03
me  <ARGM-GOL
the  
deals  V01
and  
getting  V01
me  <ARG4
the  
furniture  <ARG1
quickly  <ARGM-TMP
,  
Ahmed  
,  
was  V01
nice  V01
and  
mostly  
professional  
,  
except  
the  
semi-sketchiness  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Then  >ARGM-ADV
one  
day  >ARGM-TMP
,  
Ahmed  >>ARG1
left  V11
the  
country  <ARG1
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
to  
return  V01
for  
months  <ARGM-TMP
,  
WITHOUT  
informing  V01
me  <ARG1
.  

He  >>ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
neglected  V01
to  
tell  V01
the  
other  
person  >ARG0
working  V01
at  
the  
store  <ARG2
about  
a  
dining  
room  
table  >>>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
had  V01
ordered  V02
and  
that  >>>R-ARG1
was  V03
supposed  V02
to  
be  V03
coming  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
.  

The  
other  
person  >>>ARG0
working  V01
at  
the  
store  <ARG2
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
that  
I  >ARG0
still  >ARGM-TMP
had  V04
this  
table  >ARG1
coming  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
had  V01
paid  V01
in  
cash  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
said  V01
he  >ARG0
had  V03
no  
receipt  <ARG1
/  
record  
of  
my  >ARG0
purchase  V01
.  

I  >ARG1
came  V01
back  <ARGM-DIR
with  
the  
receipt  >>ARG1
Ahmed  >>ARG0
had  V01
provided  V01
upon  
my  >ARG0
purchase  V01
,  
and  
the  
guy  >>>ARG0
took  V10
forever  <ARG1
to  
copy  V01
it  <ARG1
but  
said  V01
that  
he  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
take  VLV
care  V03
of  
the  
situation  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG1
waited  V01
.  

And  >ARGM-DIS
waited  V01
.  

He  >ARG0
never  >ARGM-NEG
once  >ARGM-ADV
contacted  V01
us  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
've  V01
had  V02
to  
pester  V01
this  
new  
guy  <ARG1
several  
times  <ARGM-TMP
to  
ask  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
my  
table  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
arrive  V01
.  

He  >>>ARG1
kept  V02
saying  V01
different  
arrival  V01
/  
delivery  V01
dates  <<<ARG1
and  
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem  V01
terribly  
apologetic  <C-ARG1
.  

It  >>ARG1
has  V01
been  V01
3  
weeks  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG0
STILL  >>ARGM-TMP
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
my  
table  >>ARG1
(  
which  >>R-ARG1
was  V01
NOT  >ARGM-NEG
cheap  V02
,  
I  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
add  V01
)  
.  

Point  >ARG1
is  V01
:  
You  >>>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
get  VLV
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
deal  V01
on  
some  
nice  
furniture  <ARG2
--  
which  
I  
did  V01
--  
but  
they  >ARG1
're  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
very  
communicative  <ARG2
and  
god  >ARG0
forbid  V01
something  >ARG1
goes  V08
wrong  <ARG2
,  
you  >>>ARG0
'll  
have  V02
to  
fight  V01
to  
get  V04
it  >ARG1
resolved  V01
.  

Poor  >ARGM-ADJ
Service  V02

Run  V02
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
walk  V01
.  

My  >ARG0
experience  V01
with  
Home  
Delivery  
Service  <ARG1
has  V01
been  V01
one  <ARG2
of  
disappointment  V01
and  
anger  
.  

If  
I  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
give  VLV
them  >ARG1
a  
lower  >ARGM-CXN
rating  V01
than  
poor  <C-ARGM-CXN
I  
would  
.  

On  
August  >>ARGM-TMP
21st  
,  
2009  
I  >>ARG0
ordered  V02
furniture  <ARG1
from  
Hickory  
Furniture  
Mart  <ARG3
and  
contracted  V02
for  
HDS  >ARG0
to  
deliver  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

After  
seventeen  
days  >ARGM-TMP
the  
delivery  
van  >ARG1
showed  V02
up  
at  
my  
home  <ARGM-LOC
minus  
two  
pieces  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >>ARG2
was  V03
later  >ARGM-TMP
told  V01
they  >>>ARG1
had  V01
been  V03
left  V12
at  
the  
warehouse  <ARG2
and  
some  
future  
date  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
delivered  V01
.  

No  
one  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
give  V01
me  <ARG2
a  
date  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
spent  V01
$  <ARG3
2300  
on  
the  
bedroom  
suite  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
was  V01
complete  <ARG2
and  
excellent  
condition  
on  
the  
showroom  
floor  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Upon  
delivery  V01
it  
was  V01
clear  V06
the  
entire  
set  >>ARG1
was  V03
damaged  V01
:  
a  
piece  >ARG1
of  
wood  
was  V01
broke  <ARG2
on  
the  
headboard  <ARGM-LOC
;  
the  
chest  >>ARG0
of  
drawers  
was  V03
missing  V01
all  
four  
pieces  <ARG1
necessary  
to  
attach  V01
the  
legs  <ARG1
;  
the  
dresser  
back  
legs  >>>ARG0
were  V03
pushed  V01
in  <ARG2
causing  V01
the  
dresser  >ARG0
to  
lean  V01
into  
the  
wall  <ARG2
;  
and  
a  
nighstand  >>ARG0
was  V03
missing  V01
a  
drawer  <ARG1
.  

How  >>ARGM-MNR
do  V01
you  >ARG0
lose  V02
a  
drawer  <ARG1
.  

After  
complaining  V01
on  
September  <ARGM-TMP
10th  
to  
National  
Home  
Furnishings  <ARG2
,  
Boyles  
,  
the  
Hickory  
Furniture  
Mart  
and  
Home  
Delivery  
Service  
the  
latter  >>ARG0
finally  >>ARGM-TMP
called  V02
me  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
and  
said  V01
they  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
up  <ARG2
to  
pick  V01
the  
dresser  <ARG1
and  
chest  
of  
drawers  
at  
some  
future  
point  <ARGM-TMP
and  
at  
some  
later  
point  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
professional  >ARGM-MNR
repaired  V01
and  
at  
some  
later  
point  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
returned  V02
.  

The  
customer  >ARG2
service  V02
at  
Home  
Delivery  
Service  <ARG0
was  V01
terrible  V01
let  
alone  
their  >ARG0
promise  V01
to  
proper  >ARGM-MNR
set  V03
up  
furniture  <ARG1
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG1
am  V01
in  
limbo  <ARG2
regarding  
a  
bedroom  
suite  <ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >ARG0
hope  V01
the  
owners  >ARG0
and  
employees  
of  
this  
store  
have  V03
broken  
bedroom  
suites  <ARG1
in  
their  
homes  
and  
furniture  >ARG1
sitting  V01
in  
someone  
's  
warehouse  <ARG2
.  

Maybe  >ARGM-ADV
then  >ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
begin  V02
to  
understand  V01
poor  >ARGM-ADJ
customer  >ARG2
service  V02
and  
terrible  >ARGM-ADJ
sit  >ARGM-ADJ
up  
service  V02
.  

Excellent  
Driving  
School  

I  >>ARG1
was  V03
involved  V01
in  
a  
car  
accident  <ARG2
20  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
and  
since  
then  >>>ARGM-TMP
I  >>>ARG1
've  V01
been  V01
a  
nervous  
wreck  <ARG2
and  
have  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
been  V01
behind  
the  
wheel  <ARG2
.  

Unfortunately  >ARGM-ADV
,  
a  
family  
emergency  >ARG0
required  V01
me  >ARG0
to  
conquer  V01
this  
fear  V01
.  

A  
very  
good  
friend  >ARG0
of  
mine  
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommended  V01
the  
Professional  
Driving  
School  <ARG1
and  
I  >>>ARG0
was  V03
told  V01
to  
specifically  >ARGM-MNR
ask  V02
for  
Gerry  <ARG1
.  

She  >>ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommended  V01
him  <ARG1
and  
described  V01
him  <ARG1
as  
the  
"  
Saintly  
Instructor  <ARG2
and  
Simply  
the  
Best  
Instructor  >ARG1
there  
is  V02
....  
very  
calm  
,  
pleasant  
and  
very  
detailed  
in  
giving  VLV
instructions  V01
"  
.  

I  >ARG0
called  V02
the  
school  <ARG1
most  
probably  <ARGM-ADV
10  
times  <ARGM-ADV
before  
I  >ARG0
finally  >ARGM-TMP
enrolled  V01
in  
a  
20  
hour  
package  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
cancel  V01
my  >ARG2
initial  >ARGM-TMP
lesson  V01
4  
times  <<ARGM-TMP
and  
on  
the  
5th  >ARGM-TMP
attempt  V01
the  
management  V01
was  V01
quick  V02
enough  <ARGM-CXN
to  
associate  V01
my  >ARG0
cancellations  V01
with  
my  >ARG0
fear  V01
and  
finally  >ARGM-TMP
encouraged  V01
me  <ARG1
into  
taking  VLV
my  >ARGM-GOL
initial  >ARGM-TMP
lesson  V01
.  

Five  
minutes  
before  
my  >ARG2
initial  >ARGM-TMP
lesson  V01
,  
I  >>ARG1
got  VLV
a  
call  V02
from  
Gerry  <ARG0
advising  V01
me  <ARG1
of  
his  >ARG1
arrival  V01
and  
to  
come  V01
down  <ARGM-DIR
as  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
as  
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
ready  V02
.  

My  
heart  >>>ARG1
pounded  V05
as  
I  >ARG0
walked  V01
down  <ARG2
and  
pounded  V05
even  
faster  <ARGM-MNR
upon  
seeing  V01
Gerry  <ARG1
in  
an  
SUV  <ARGM-LOC
-  
Lexus  
!  

I  >>ARG0
thought  V01
of  
canceling  V01
the  
lesson  V01
once  
again  <<ARGM-TMP
because  
I  >>>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
feel  V01
comfortable  <ARG1
driving  V01
an  
SUV  <ARG1
.  

Gerry  >ARG0
pleasantly  >ARGM-MNR
said  V01
"  
since  
I  >ARG1
am  V01
already  <ARGM-TMP
here  >>>ARGM-CAU
why  >>>ARGM-CAU
do  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
we  >>ARG0
give  VLV
it  >ARG2
shot  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
trust  V02
you  <ARG1
and  
believe  V01
that  
you  >>>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
handle  V01
this  <ARG1
and  
all  >>>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
have  V02
to  
do  V02
is  V01
to  
reciprocate  V01
!  

Trust  V02
me  <ARG1
and  
most  
especially  >ARGM-ADV
trust  V02
and  
believe  V01
in  <ARG1
yourself  <ARG1
.  

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
worry  V02
,  
I  >>ARG0
'll  >>ARGM-MOD
take  VLV
care  V03
of  
you  <ARG1
!  
"  

.......  
the  
rest  >ARG1
was  V01
history  <ARG2
!  

Here  >ARG2
I  >>ARG0
am  V01
now  <ARGM-TMP
driving  V01
confidently  <ARGM-MNR
on  
my  
own  <ARGM-MNR
.  

Gerry  >ARGM-DIS

I  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
thank  V01
you  >ARG0
enough  <ARGM-EXT

To

Review  V01
on  
House  
of  
Joy  
Chinese  
Restaurant  <ARG1

My  
family  >>>ARG0
and  
I  
moved  V01
to  
San  <ARG2
Antonio  
a  
year  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
and  
have  V01
tried  V01
almost  
all  <ARG1
of  
the  
Chinese  
Restaurants  
because  
we  >ARG0
love  V01
Chinese  
food  <ARG1
.  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
it  
took  V10
us  >ARG0
a  
while  <ARG1
to  
find  V01
one  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
we  >ARG0
liked  V01
.  

But  
we  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADV
like  V01
House  <ARG1
of  
Joy  
WE  >ARG0
LOVE  V01
IT  <ARG1
.  

Everything  >>>ARG1
we  >>ARG0
have  V01
gotten  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
has  V01
been  V01
more  
authentic  <ARG2
and  
better  
tasting  
than  
any  
other  
Chinese  
restaurant  >>ARG2
in  
the  
San  
Antonio  
area  
we  >>ARG1
have  V01
been  V01
to  <C-ARG2
--  
and  
trust  V02
me  <ARG1
we  >>ARG1
have  V01
been  V01
to  
a  
lot  <ARG2
of  
them  
.  

We  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
happen  V02
to  
stumble  V01
across  
this  
little  
restaurant  <ARG1
one  
day  <ARGM-TMP
when  
we  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
visit  V01
the  
Bexar  
County  
Tax  
Office  <ARG1
off  
of  
Bandera  
Road  
.  

We  >>>ARG0
stopped  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
and  
got  V01
some  
take  
out  <ARG1
and  
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
stop  V01
going  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
.  

They  >ARG0
have  V03
the  
best  
Egg  
Drop  
Soup  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
tasted  V01
.  

We  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
love  V01
their  
Egg  
Rolls  <ARG1
and  
Spring  
Rolls  
.  

And  >>>ARGM-DIS
every  
entree  >>>ARG1
we  >>ARG0
have  V01
ordered  V02
is  V01
perfect  V02
.  

Everything  >>>ARG1
is  V03
always  >ARGM-TMP
cooked  V01
fresh  <ARGM-MNR
and  
tastes  V02
fresh  V04
.  

Their  >ARG0
prices  V01
are  V01
extremely  >ARGM-EXT
reasonable  V02
for  
the  
amount  >ARG1
of  
food  
you  >ARG0
receive  V01
.  

The  
staff  >>ARG1
is  V01
also  >ARGM-ADV
just  >ARGM-DIS
so  >ARGM-EXT
pleasant  V02
to  
deal  V01
with  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG1
are  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
quick  V02
at  
getting  V04
your  >ARG0
order  V02
out  <<ARG1
to  
you  
.  

You  >>>ARG1
do  V01
n't  
have  V02
to  
sit  V01
and  
wait  V01
around  <ARGM-ADV
forever  <ARGM-TMP
like  
most  
places  <ARGM-ADV
!!  

So  >>>ARGM-DIS
anyone  >>>ARG0
looking  V01
for  
an  
Excellent  
night  <ARG1
out  
for  
Chinese  
or  
maybe  
just  
lunch  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
stop  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
and  
try  V01
it  <ARG1
because  
I  >ARG0
promise  V01
you  <ARG1
2  
things  <ARG2
---  
You  >ARG0
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
regret  V01
it  <ARG1
!!  

and  >ARGM-DIS
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
go  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
for  
more  <ARGM-PRP
!!!

PS  
I  >>ARG0
have  V01
noticed  V01
on  
here  <ARGM-LOC
that  
someone  >ARG0
left  V12
a  
comment  V01
that  
"  
all  >>ARG1
of  
the  
nice  >ARGM-ADJ
comments  V01
must  >ARGM-MOD
come  V01
from  
co  
workers  <ARG3
or  
friends  
"  
and  
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
tell  V01
you  <ARG2
that  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V02
these  
people  <ARG1
except  
from  
eating  V01
at  
their  
restaurant  <ARGM-LOC
.  

We  >>ARG1
are  V01
from  
Virginia  <ARG2
and  
just  >ARGM-TMP
moved  V01
here  <ARG2
a  
year  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

So  >>ARGM-ADV
that  
comment  V01
is  V01
completely  
false  <ARG2
.  

Because  
we  >ARG0
think  V01
IT  >ARG1
'S  V01
THE  
BEST  <ARG2
!!!  

and  >>ARGM-DIS
we  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V02
them  <ARG1
except  
for  
eating  V01
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Dr.  >ARG1
Strzalka  
at  
Flagship  
CVTS  
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
good  
doctor  <ARG2

I  >>ARG0
am  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure  V01
about  
the  
quality  <ARG1
of  
the  
other  
doctors  
there  
,  
but  
i  >>ARG0
do  V01
know  V01
from  
personal  >ARGM-MNR
experience  V01
that  
Dr.  >>>ARG0
Christopher  
T.  
Strzalka  
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
man  <ARG2
of  
his  
word  
,  
and  
is  V01
also  >ARGM-ADV
very  >ARGM-EXT
CRUEL  V01
AND  
UNCARING  
!!  

He  >>>ARG0
was  V03
going  V04
to  
operate  V01
and  
replace  V01
my  
bicuspid  
aortic  
valve  <ARG1
due  
to  
critical  
aortic  
stenosis  <ARGM-CAU
.  

I  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
surgery  
date  <ARG1
of  
July  
17  
,  
2008  
.  

Then  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
renigged  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
read  V01
my  
Health  
Care  
Proxy  <ARG1
,  
even  
though  
i  >>ARG1
agreed  V01
to  
be  V01
on  
the  
ventilator  <ARG2
for  
2  
months  <ARGM-TMP
following  
surgery  <ARGM-TMP
(  
as  
he  >>ARG0
had  V01
twice  >ARGM-TMP
stated  V01
i  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
agree  V01
to  <ARG1
)  
.  

He  >ARG0
later  >ARGM-TMP
said  V01
that  
by  
2  
months  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
"  
meant  V01
at  
least  
two  
months  <ARG2
"  
.  

Two  
months  >ARG1
and  
at  
least  
two  
months  
are  V01
totally  
different  
things  <ARG2
.  

He  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
give  V01
me  <ARG2
the  
chance  V02
to  
say  V01
i  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
stay  V01
on  
the  
ventilator  <ARG3
longer  <ARGM-TMP
,  
which  
i  
would  
have  V01
.  

A  
Health  
Care  
Proxy  >>>ARG1
is  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
written  V01
in  
stone  <ARGM-MNR
and  
can  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
changed  V01
.  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
never  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
said  V01
he  >>ARG1
was  V01
sorry  V01
.  

Just  >>>ARGM-DIS
said  V01
i  >>ARG1
was  V01
inoperable  V01
and  
walked  V01
out  
of  
the  
hospital  
room  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
,  
therefore  >ARGM-DIS
,  
now  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
says  V01
i  >>ARG1
am  V01
inoperable  V01
(  
even  
though  
i  >>ARG1
am  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
100  
%  >ARGM-EXT
inoperable  V01
)  
,  
and  
he  >>ARG0
is  V03
letting  V01
me  >ARG1
die  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG1
am  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
middle  >ARG2
aged  V01
and  
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
die  V05
,  
but  
thanks  V01
to  
this  
doctor  <ARG1
i  >ARG0
have  V03
no  
other  
alternatives  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
,  
along  
with  
my  
friends  >ARGM-ADV
,  
consider  V01
this  
doctor  >ARG1
to  
be  V01
the  
cause  <ARG2
of  
my  >ARG1
death  V01
as  
he  >>>ARG0
is  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
trying  V01
to  
save  V02
my  
life  <ARG1
by  
operating  V01
.  

Even  
my  
PA  >>ARG0
i  >ARG0
went  V02
to  <C-ARG4
the  
other  
day  <ARGM-TMP
said  V01
"  
it  
must  >ARGM-MOD
by  V01
comforting  <ARG2
to  
have  V01
gone  V02
to  
a  
heart  
surgeon  >ARG0
like  
him  
who  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
nothing  <ARG1
for  
you  <ARG2
"  
.  

He  >ARG0
said  V01
it  <ARG1
sarcastically  <ARGM-MNR
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
want  V01
a  
doctor  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
will  >>>ARGM-MOD
lie  V08
to  
you  <ARG2
and  
say  V01
he  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
operate  V01
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
change  V01
his  
mind  <ARG1
,  
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
what  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
is  V03
talking  V01
about  <C-ARG1
when  >>>ARGM-TMP
he  >>>ARG0
recommends  V01
procedures  V01
at  
other  
hospitals  <ARGM-LOC
and  
says  V01
they  >ARG1
are  V01
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
need  V01
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
work  V01
for  
you  <ARG2
,  
go  V02
to  
this  
doctor  <ARG4
...  
he  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
one  <ARG2
for  
you  
.  

What  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
learn  V01
from  
the  
below  >ARGM-LOC
'  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
'  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
suggest  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
avoiding  V01
Second  
Home  <ARG1
based  
on  
the  
'  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
'  
review  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG0
'd  >>ARGM-MOD
probably  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V01
more  >ARGM-EXT
inclined  V01
to  
board  V02
my  
two  
dogs  <ARG0
here  <ARG1
,  
seeing  V01
that  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
just  >ARGM-ADV
take  V01
every  
dog  >ARG1
coming  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
.  

I  >>>ARG1
've  V01
toured  V01
this  
place  <ARG1
and  
was  V03
impressed  V01
by  
how  
clean  >ARG2
the  
place  >ARG1
was  V01
,  
and  
all  
the  
options  
for  
the  
dogs  
.  

It  
's  V01
unfortunate  V01
that  
bmil  >ARG0
believed  V01
that  
his  
'  
perfect  
'  
dog  >>ARG2
was  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
given  V01
the  
right  
opportunity  <ARG1
to  
prove  V01
himself  <ARG1
.  

But  
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
done  V02
hundreds  <ARG1
of  
dog  >ARG1
introductions  V01
myself  <<ARGM-REC
(  
another  
place  
,  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
work  V01
here  <ARG2
)  
,  
and  
owners  >>>ARG0
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  VLV
unrealistic  >>ARGM-MNR
expectations  V01
and  
views  V02
of  
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
see  V01
when  >ARGM-TMP
their  
dogs  >ARG0
meet  V02
other  
dogs  <ARG1
.  

Workers  >>>ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
do  V02
these  
introductions  V01
look  V01
at  
the  
interaction  V01
objectively  <<ARGM-MNR
;  
and  
it  >>>ARG0
's  V01
good  V02
to  
see  V01
they  >>>ARG0
are  V01
able  V01
and  
willing  V02
to  
say  V01
no  <ARG1
if  
they  >ARG0
feel  V02
there  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V02
a  
problem  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
sounds  V01
(  
according  
to  
your  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-ADJ
statement  V01
)  
that  
they  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
roomful  <ARG1
of  
dogs  
,  
so  >>>ARGM-ADV
they  >>>ARG0
must  >>>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
doing  V02
something  <ARG1
right  <ARGM-MNR
-  
and  
are  V03
keeping  V02
those  
dogs  >ARG1
safe  V01
from  
potential  
problems  <ARG2
.  

You  >ARG0
say  V01
you  >ARG0
work  V01
a  
lot  <ARGM-EXT
,  
and  
that  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
young  
dog  <ARG1
;  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
I  >>ARG0
have  VLV
little  >ARGM-ADJ
doubt  V01
that  
your  
dog  >>>ARG0
is  V03
just  >ARGM-ADV
filled  V01
with  
energy  >ARG1
to  
burn  V01
;  
and  
it  
is  V01
good  V02
of  
you  <ARGM-CAU
to  
look  V01
for  
a  
place  >ARG3
to  
take  V01
him  <ARG1
.  

But  
not  
at  
a  
risk  V01
to  
other  
people  
's  
pets  <ARG2
.  

You  >>ARG2
were  V03
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
given  V01
another  
alternative  <ARG1
by  
Second  
Home  <ARG0
,  
to  
board  V02
him  <ARG0
-  
which  >>ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
given  V01
your  
dog  <ARG2
a  
chance  V02
to  
come  V01
and  
go  V02
from  
Second  
Home  <ARG3
a  
couple  
times  <ARGM-TMP
,  
getting  V03
used  V02
to  
the  
place  <ARG1
and  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
facilitating  V01
another  
attempt  V01
to  
get  V05
into  
daycare  <ARG2
later  <ARGM-TMP
.  

No  
business  >>>ARG0
is  V03
going  V04
to  
push  V01
customers  <ARG1
away  <ARG2
without  
good  
reason  <ARGM-CAU
;  
so  V01
is  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
it  <ARG1
reasonable  V02
to  
think  V01
they  >ARG0
might  >ARGM-MOD
know  V01
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
're  V03
doing  V02
?  

My  
dogs  >ARG1
are  V01
far  <ARG2
from  
perfect  
,  
and  
one  >>ARG1
of  
them  
I  >ARG0
believe  V01
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
little  
much  <ARG2
for  
daycare  
here  
herself  <ARGM-REC
(  
at  <ARGM-ADV
least  
initially  
)  
.  

Be  V01
a  
little  
more  >ARGM-EXT
reasonable  V02
with  
your  >ARG0
expectations  V01
of  
a  
place  <ARG1
like  
this  
;  
and  
maybe  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
jump  V03
to  
personal  >ARGM-ADJ
attacks  V01
suggesting  V01
that  
they  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
work  V01
hard  <ARGM-MNR
,  
just  
because  
you  >ARG0
bruised  V01
your  
own  
ego  <ARG1
.  

Dumbest  
F'ers  
ever  

I  >ARG0
called  V02
dominos  <ARG1
tonight  <ARGM-TMP
,  
it  >ARG1
rang  V04
forever  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>>ARG0
get  V03
put  V03
on  
hold  V03
twice  <<ARGM-TMP
without  
saying  V01
a  
word  <ARG1
and  
FINALLY  >ARGM-TMP
someone  >ARG0
says  V01
,  
MAY  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
HELP  V01
YOU  <ARG2
?  

So  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
say  V01
:  
I  >ARG1
'm  V01
at  
the  
Radison  
Warwick  
hotel  >ARG1
in  
Rittenhouse

1926  <ARGM-TMP
)  
do  V01

They  >ARG0
say  V01
no  
,  
Warwick  <ARG1
in  
New  
Jersey  
,  
Call  V02
New  
Jersey  <ARG1

I  >>ARG0
laugh  V01
and  
say  V01
,  
no  >ARGM-DIS
,  
that  
Warwick  >ARG1
is  V01
in  
New  
York  <ARG2
,  
but  
I  >ARG1
'm  V01
at  
the  
Radison  
-  
Warwick  <ARG2

And  >ARGM-DIS
he  >ARG0
says  V01
:  
You  >ARG1

Pennsylvania  
?  

and  
I  >ARG0
said  V01

YES

PHILLY  <ARG1

and  
he  >ARG0
says  V01
,  
NO  >ARGM-DIS

Warwick  >ARG1

a  
township  <ARG2
,  
If  
you  >ARG1

I  >ARG1
am  V01
at  
the  
RADISON  
WARWICK  
HOTEL  <ARG2

He  >ARG0
says  V01
:

that  
town  <ARG1
,  
I  >>ARG1
have  V02

Yes  >ARG1

16th  
and  
15th  
YES

one  
mile  
west  
of  
you

You  >ARG1
're  V01
at  
7th  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG1
am  V01
just  
south  <ARG2
of  
Walnut  
.  

She  >ARG0
says  V01

Is  V01

past

YES  >ARGM-DIS

is  V01
14th  
street  <ARG2
and  
I  >ARG1
am  V01
3  
blocks  
west  <ARG2
of  
broad  
and  
one  
south  
of  
walnut  
.  

Hmmm  
,  
she  >ARG0
says  V01
,  
Then  
why  >>ARGM-CAU
are  V03
you  >ARG0
calling  V02
here  <ARG1
,  
we  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
past  
broad  <ARG1
?  

Anyway  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
after  
much  >>ARGM-ADJ
yelling  V01
and  
cussing  V01
I  >>>ARG0
hung  V03
up  
,  
grabbed  V01
a  
cab  <ARG1
,  
and  
went  V02
to  
Geno  <ARG4
's  
.  

Quick  
to  
take  V01
money  <ARG1
but  
not  
quick  
to  
fix  V02
a  
problem  <ARG1
!  

B&B  >>ARG0
came  V01
out  <ARGM-DIR
very  
quickly  <ARGM-TMP
to  
give  V01
us  <ARG2
our  >ARGM-GOL
quote  V01
back  
in  
June  <<<ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >>>ARG0
were  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
polite  V01
,  
eager  V01
to  
answer  V01
any  
questions  V01
and  
willing  V02
to  
wait  V01
for  
us  >ARG1
to  
return  V01
from  
vacation  V01
to  
begin  V02
installing  V01
our  
fence  <ARG1
.  

Our  
fence  >>ARG1
was  V03
installed  V01
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
in  
August  <ARGM-TMP
and  
they  >>>ARG0
had  V03
their  
money  <ARG1
and  
left  V11
saying  V01
"  
Workmanship  >>ARG1
is  V03
guaranteed  V01
for  
a  
year  <ARGM-TMP
!  
"  
.  

Within  
a  
week  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
noticed  V01
one  >ARG1
of  
the  
boards  
on  
our  
gate  
splitting  V01
where  >>ARGM-LOC
a  
nail  >>ARG1
had  V01
gone  V01
in  <ARGM-DIR
.  

We  >ARG0
called  V02
our  
representative  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
assured  V01
me  <ARG1
he  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
call  V02
the  
office  <ARG1
and  
have  V04
it  >>ARG1
taken  VLV
care  V03
of  <C-ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
heard  V01
nothing  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
then  >ARGM-TMP
called  V02
the  
office  <ARG1
and  
the  
man  >>ARG0
we  >ARG0
spoke  V01
to  <C-ARG2
said  V01
he  >>>ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD
send  V02
someone  >ARG0
out  <ARGM-DIR
to  
look  V01
at  
it  <ARG1
but  
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
promise  V01
when  <ARGM-TMP
-  
two  
weeks  >>ARG1
came  V01
and  
went  V01
and  
we  >ARG0
heard  V01
nothing  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG2
just  >>>ARGM-TMP
called  V02
again  <ARGM-TMP
and  
was  V03
told  V01
that  
workmanship  >>ARG1
,  
not  
wood  
,  
is  V03
guaranteed  V01
for  
a  
year  <ARGM-TMP
-  
well  >ARGM-DIS
in  
my  
opinion  >ARGM-ADV
-  
the  
wood  >ARG1
split  V01
due  
to  
a  
nail  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
part  <ARG2
of  
workmanship  
!  

She  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-DIS
went  V02
so  
far  <ARGM-ADV
as  
to  
say  V01
"  
You  >>ARG0
r  V03
calling  V02
about  
one  
board  <ARGM-PRP
?  
"  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
-  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
pay  V01
over  
$  <ARG1
1000  
for  
something  <ARG3
you  >ARG0
want  V01
it  >>>ARG1
to  
hold  V11
up  
and  
look  V02
good  V02
!!!  

YES  
!  

I  >>ARG0
WAS  V03
calling  V02
about  
one  
board  <ARGM-PRP
!!  

I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
frustrated  V01
at  
this  
point  <ARGM-TMP
-  
it  
would  >ARGM-MOD
take  V10
all  
of  
10  
min  <ARG1
for  
them  >>ARG0
to  
come  V01
by  <ARGM-DIR
and  
replace  V01
the  
one  
board  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is  V03
cracked  V02
(  
the  
crack  >>ARG1
is  V01
deep  V02
enough  <ARGM-CXN
to  
stick  V01
a  
penny  <ARG1
in  
it  <ARG2
and  
it  >ARG1
goes  V01
clear  
through  <ARGM-DIR
)  
yet  
they  >>>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
take  V01
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
bother  V02
with  
what  >>>ARG1
once  >>>ARGM-TMP
WAS  V01
a  
happy  
customer  <ARG2
and  
has  V01
now  >ARGM-TMP
become  V01
a  
dissatisfied  
customer  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
figure  V01
if  
they  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
take  V01
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
fix  V02
the  
fence  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
they  >ARG0
installed  V01
then  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
take  V01
the  
time  <ARG1
to  
let  V01
everyone  >ARG0
I  
can  
know  V01
about  
how  >ARG2
they  >ARG0
treat  V01
customers  <ARG1
once  
they  >ARG0
have  V03
your  
money  <ARG1
!!!  

STAY  V01
AWAY  <ARG3
!!!  

YOU  >ARG0
GET  V01
WHAT  >ARG3
YOU  >ARG0
PAY  V01
FOR  <C-ARG3
!!!  

They  >ARG1
came  V07
in  
under  
a  
lot  <ARG2
of  
other  >ARGM-ADJ
quotes  V01
and  
now  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
know  V01
why  <ARG1
!!!  

When  >>ARGM-TMP
the  
fence  >>ARG1
was  V03
first  >ARGM-TMP
installed  V01
I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
given  V01
them  <ARG2
five  
stars  <ARG1
,  
now  >>>ARGM-TMP
for  
their  
poor  >ARGM-ADJ
customer  >ARG1
follow  V03
-  
up  >>>ARGM-CAU
and  
unwillingness  
to  
fix  V02
the  
fence  <ARG1
they  >>ARG1
have  V01
dropped  V01
to  
a  
one  
-  
star  <ARG4
in  
my  
opinion  <ARGM-ADV
!  

Lots  
of  
rules  V01
,  
phantom  
innkeeper  
,  
last  
minute  >ARGM-TMP
price  V01
was  V01
worth  V02
it  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
called  V02
the  
"  
207  
"  
number  <ARG1
and  
listened  V01
to  
the  
same  
recording  
loop  <ARG1
3  
times  <ARGM-TMP
before  
I  >ARG0
gave  V07
up  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
then  >>>ARGM-TMP
called  V02
the  
800  
number  <ARG1
(  
which  >>ARG1
was  V03
answered  V01
)  
and  
inquired  V01
about  
last  
minute  
rates  <ARG1
.  

They  >ARG0
had  V03
a  
room  >ARG1
with  
a  
$  
99  
rate  
,  
which  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
booked  V03
.  

The  
room  >>>ARG1
was  V03
supposed  V02
to  
be  V01
on  
the  
2nd  
floor  <ARG2
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
put  V01
us  <ARG1
on  
the  
3rd  <ARG2
.  

The  
email  >ARGM-MNR
confirmation  V01
(  
which  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
read  V01
in  
the  
car  <ARGM-LOC

warned  V01
about  
large  
suitcases  <ARG1
,  
declaring  V01
that  
we  >ARG1
are  V01
innkeepers  <ARG2
,  
not  
longshoreman  
.  

In  
other  
words  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
help  V01
with  
suitcases  <ARG1
,  
but  
they  >ARG0
promise  V01
totes  >ARG0
to  
help  V01
.  

However  
upon  
our  >ARG1
arrival  V01
no  
one  
there  
(  
the  
inn  >>ARG1
was  V01
open  V01

.  

So  
no  
totes  
.  

Finally  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
chambermaid  >>ARG0
stuck  V01
her  
head  <ARG1
around  
the  
corner  <ARG2
from  
the  
top  <ARGM-DIR
of  
the  
stairs

told  V01
us  <ARG2

be  V03
accommodated  V01
until

no  >ARGM-NEG

Then  >>ARGM-TMP
she  >>ARG1
was  V01
gone  V02
.  

We  >>ARG0
returned  V01
after

found  V01
no

pay  V01
their  
rack

Quit  V01
with  
the  
overstatements  <ARG1
!  

The  
worst  
thing  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
happen  V01
for  
any  
restaurant  <ARG2
like  
Zahav  
is  V01
to  
have  V04
too  
many  
people  >ARG0
write  V01
hyperbolic  >ARGM-ADJ
reviews  V01
making  VLV
claims  V01
that  
"  
everyone  >>>ARG0
"  
is  V03
going  V04
to  
"  
love  V01
"  
the  
food  <ARG1
,  
decor  
and  
service  V02
.  

The  
truth  >ARG1
is  V01
,  
in  
my  >ARG0
and  
my  
dining  
partners  
'  
experience  V01
,  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
fine  
little  
restaurant  <ARG2
with  
some  
unique  
food  
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
an  
entirely  
up  >ARGM-ADJ
and  
down  
experience  V01
,  
however  <<ARGM-DIS
.  

Now  >ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
best  >ARG1
of  
that  
unique  
food  
comes  V01
at  
the  
very  >ARGM-ADJ
beginning  V01
of  
the  
meal  <ARG1
.  

The  
salatim  
salads  >ARG1
are  V01
the  
smallest  
plates  >>>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
've  V01
ever  >ARGM-TMP
seen  V01
placed  V01
in  
front  <ARG2
of  
me  
(  
you  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
most  
likely  >ARGM-ADV
think  V01
they  >ARG1
were  V01
condiments  <ARG2
if  
it  >>ARG1
were  V03
n't  >ARGM-NEG
explained  V01
to  
you  <ARG2
)  
.  

Though  
they  >>ARG1
are  V01
mostly  >ARGM-ADV
excellent  V02
,  
you  >>ARG0
generally  >>ARGM-ADV
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
get  V01
enough  
forkfuls  >ARGM-ADV
to  
know  V01
if  
you  >ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
love  V01
them  <ARG1
.  

That  >>ARG1
being  V03
said  V01
,  
the  
laffa  >ARG1
and  
hummus  
are  V01
out  
of  
this  
world  <ARG2
.  

Then  
again  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
for  
the  
three  >>ARGM-GOL
of  
us  
who  >R-ARG0
dined  V01
together  <ARGM-ADV
,  
two  
pieces  >ARG0
of  
flatbread  
left  V13
us  >>ARG0
fighting  V01
for  
more  <ARG2
,  
and  
licking  V01
the  
hummus  <ARG1
from  
our  
fingers  <ARGM-DIR
(  
and  >>ARGM-DIS
yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
those  
two  
pieces  >>ARG0
of  
flatbread  
did  V01
represent  V01
a  
three  
-  
person  >ARG2
order  V02
)  
.  

Dinner  >ARG1
was  V01
also  <ARGM-ADV
an  
up  >ARGM-ADJ
-  
and  
-  
down  
experience  V01
.  

The  
vegetarian  
dishes  >ARG1
and  
lighter  
fare  
were  V01
almost  
always  <ARGM-TMP
spot  
-  
on  <ARG2
,  
while  
the  
lamb  >ARG1
was  V01
often  <ARGM-TMP
dry  <ARG2
and  
/  
or  
overcooked  
.  

The  
duck  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
65  
%  
glob  <ARG2
of  
chewy  
fat  
with  
no  
resemblance  
to  
the  
juicy  
,  
crispy  
delicacy  >ARG1
it  >ARG0
usually  >ARGM-TMP
represents  V01
at  
other  
establishments  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Dessert  >ARG1
was  V01
...  
hmmm  
,  
that  >>ARG2
's  V01
interesting  V01
,  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
remember  V01
dessert  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
guess  V01
that  >ARG0
tells  V01
you  <ARG2
a  
lot  <ARG1
.  

Oh  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
yes  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
chocolate  
semifreddo  >>ARG1
was  V01
quite  >ARGM-EXT
good  V02
.  

The  
warm  
chocolate  
cake  >>>ARG1
was  V01
very  
tasty  <ARG2
,  
but  
served  V02
at  
room  
temperature  <ARGM-MNR
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
warm  V07
by  
any  
stretch  <ARGM-ADV
of  
the  
imagination  V01
.  

And  
my  
--  
no  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
remember  V01
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
had  V03
.  

Service  V02
was  V01
average  <ARG2
,  
but  
nothing  
special  
,  
and  
restaurants  >>>ARG0
that  >>>R-ARG1
are  V03
supposed  V02
to  
be  V01
excellent  V02
should  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
a  
better  
job  <ARG1
of  
training  V01
their  
waitstaff  >>>ARG1
to  
be  V01
communicative  <ARG2
and  
friendly  V01
,  
not  >ARGM-NEG
merely  >ARGM-EXT
capable  V01
.  

Perhaps  >>>ARGM-ADV
had  
we  >>ARG0
not  >ARGM-NEG
gone  V02
into  
this  
restaurant  <ARG4
believing  V01
Zahav  >>>ARG1
was  V03
going  V04
to  
be  V01
golden  <ARG2
as  
its  
name  >ARG0
suggests  V01
(  
and  
as  
the  
many  >ARGM-ADJ
golden  >ARGM-ADJ
reviews  V01
seem  V01
to  
attest  V01
)  
,  
we  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
enjoyed  V01
a  
decent  >ARGM-ADJ
little  >ARGM-ADJ
expensive  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
one  >>ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
here  <ARG4
expecting  V01
something  <ARG1
fantastic  
,  
unless  
perhaps  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
've  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
had  V03
middle  
-  
eastern  
food  <ARG1
before  <ARGM-TMP
,  
or  
succulent  
duck  <C-ARG1
,  
tasty  
lamb  <C-ARG1
,  
decent  >ARGM-ADJ
portion  >ARG1
sizes  V01
or  
actually  
warm  
chocolate  
desserts  <<C-ARG1

PS

When  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
called  V02
for  
a  
reservation  V01
,  
we  >>ARG2
were  V03
told  V01
that  
5:00  >ARG1

9:30  
were  V01
their  >ARG1
only  >ARGM-ADJ

When  >>ARGM-TMP
we  >>ARG0
arrived  V01
at

Do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
waste  V01
your  
time  <ARG1
in  
this  
store  <ARGM-LOC
.  

At  
my  >ARG0
appointment  V02
the  
girl  >>>ARG0
helping  V01
me  <ARG2
was  V01
unable  V01
to  
adequately  >ARGM-MNR
lace  V01
up  <ARGM-PRD
some  <ARG1
of  
the  
dresses  
.  

They  >ARG0
felt  V01
like  
they  >>>ARG1
were  V03
going  V04
to  
fall  V01
off  <ARGM-DIR
of  
me  
and  
it  
was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
difficult  V01
to  
see  V01
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
actually  >ARGM-ADV
look  V02
like  <C-ARG1
were  <ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
to  
purchase  V01
some  <ARG1
of  
these  
dresses  
.  

I  >ARG0
thought  V01
it  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
good  
idea  <ARG2
to  
see  V01
how  >>ARG1
a  
few  >>ARG0
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
liked  V01
would  >ARGM-MOD
look  V02
like  <C-ARG1
on  
a  
model  <ARGM-LOC
(  
by  
looking  V05
the  
dress  <ARG1
up  <C-V
online  <ARG2
)  
.  

So  >>>ARGM-DIS
,  
as  
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
leaving  V11
I  >ARG0
asked  V01
for  
the  
designer  
/  
dress  
name  >ARG1
or  
style  
number  
associated  V01
with  
my  
top  
picks  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG0
said  V01
they  >>>ARG0
were  V01
"  
unable  V01
to  
tell  V01
me  <ARG2
until  
they  >ARG0
ordered  V02
my  
dress  <ARG1
"  
.  

Hmmm  >>>ARGM-DIS
...  
A  
person  >>>ARG0
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
not  >>>ARGM-NEG
call  V02
a  
company  <ARG1
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
have  V03
no  
idea  <ARG1
its  
name  
(  
since  
the  
designer  >>ARG1
is  V01
unknown  V01
...  
SUPPOSEDLY  <ARGM-ADV
)  
,  
and  
order  V02
a  
gown  <ARG1
without  
a  
dress  
name  <ARGM-ADV
or  
style  
number  
.  

Do  V01
other  
brides  >ARG1
fall  V10
for  
this  <ARG2
???  

They  >>>ARG0
either  
:  
a  
)  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
give  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
me  <ARG2
because  
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
me  >ARG0
purchasing  V01
the  
dress  <ARG1
elsewhere  <ARGM-LOC
or  
b  
)  
are  V03
recreating  V01
the  
dresses  <ARG1
themselves  <ARGM-REC
(  
ie  >>>ARGM-DIS

by  
their

)  
.  

I  >ARG1
'm  V01
no  
detective  <ARG2
but  
...  
uhh  
...  
seriously  
?!?  

Whatever  
type  >>>ARG1
of  
operation  V01
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
running  V01
,  
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
interested  V01
and  
if  
you  >>ARG1
're  V01
smart  V06
,  
you  >ARG1
wo  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
either  <ARGM-ADV
.  

What  
a  
waste  V01
of  
TIME  <ARG1
.  

Aside  >ARGM-ADV
from  
that  
little  
*  
mystery  
*  
,  
one  >>ARG0
of  
the  
sales  
ladies  
was  V01
quite  
comfortable  <ARG2
telling  V01
me  <ARG2
how  
wrong  >ARG2
I  >ARG1
was  V01
about  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
another  
dress  >>ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
loved  V01
compared  V01
to  
one  >>ARG1
of  
her  
dresses  
that  >>R-ARG1
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
trying  V01
on  <ARGM-PRD
.  

Somehow  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
since  
she  >>ARG0
supposedly  >>ARGM-ADV
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
any  
names  <ARG1
of  
designers  
/  
dresses  
,  
after  
I  >ARG0
told  V01
her  <ARG2
the  
designer  
and  
dress  
name  <ARG1
of  
the  
one  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
comparing  V01
,  
she  >>>ARG0
knew  V01
"  
exactly  
which  
dress  >>ARG1
"  
I  >>ARG0
was  V03
referring  V01
to  <C-ARG1
and  
disagreed  V01
with  
my  >ARG0
observation  V01
;  
she  >ARG0
said  V01
that  
the  
bodice  >>ARG1
did  V01
come  V01
as  
low  <ARG2
as  
the  
one  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
had  V03
on  <ARGM-PRD
.  

My  
point  
:  
Even  
if  
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
wrong  V04
,  
do  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
sit  V01
there  <ARG2
and  
argue  V02
with  
the  
customer  <ARG1
.  

Say  V01
something  <ARG1
like  
,  
"  
Huh  
.  

I  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
think  V01
so  <ARG1
but  
you  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
right  V06
.  
"  

Unless  
you  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
take  V01
the  
"  
tell  V01
the  
customer  >ARG2
how  
wrong  >R-ARG2
she  >ARG1
is  V01
and  
try  V01
and  
force  V01
her  <ARG1
into  
a  
dress  >>ARG1
she  >>ARG0
's  V03
obviously  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG
loving  V01
"  
approach  V02
which  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
likely  >ARGM-ADV
get  V05
you  <ARG1
...  
uh  <ARGM-DIS
...  
nowhere  <ARG2
.  

Seriously  
:  
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
waste  V01
your  
time  <ARG1
.  

Other  
shops  >ARG0
around  
this  
city  
have  V03
MUCH  
NICER  
and  
more  
TRANSPARENT  
owners  <ARG1
.  

Not  
owners  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
seem  V01
like  
they  >>>ARG0
have  V03
something  >ARG1
to  
hide  V01
and  
know  V01
nothing  <ARG1
about  
common  
courtesy  
and  
customer  >ARG2
service  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
felt  V01
very  
much  
like  
Wedding  
Gallery  >>>ARG1
was  V03
being  V01
dishonest  V01
and  
I  >>>ARG0
would  >>>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>>ARGM-NEG
trust  V01
them  >ARG0
to  
lace  V01
me  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-PRD
in  
another  
gown  <ARGM-LOC
let  
alone  
trust  V01
them  <ARG2
with  
the  
gown  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
wear  V01
on  
the  
most  
important  
day  <ARGM-TMP
of  
my  
life  
.  

AWFUL  >ARGM-ADJ
SERVICE  V02
!  

After  
happily  >ARGM-MNR
visiting  V01
Sear's  
Automotives  <ARG1
in  
the  
past  <ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
shocked  V01
at  
the  
horrible  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02
received  V01
at  
their  
Greensboro  
location  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
brought  V01
my  
car  <ARG1
in  <ARG3
on  
a  
Sunday  <ARGM-TMP
to  
replace  V01
a  
shredded  V01
tire  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
waited  V01
about  
20  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
in  
the  
store  
part  <ARGM-LOC
before  
anyone  >>>ARG0
was  V01
able  V01
to  
assist  V01
me  <ARG1
and  
was  V03
then  >ARGM-TMP
told  V01
to  
pull  V01
my  
car  <ARG1
into  
the  
shop  <ARG2
(  
that  >ARG1
is  V01
apparently  <ARGM-ADV
what  >>>ARG1
you  >>>ARG0
are  V03
supposed  V02
to  
do  V02
,  
but  
the  
big  
signs  >>>ARG1
pointing  V01
you  <ARG1
that  
way  V01
are  V03
for  
some  
reason  >ARGM-PRP
kept  V02
inside  
the  
garage  <ARG2
,  
so  >>ARGM-DIS
you  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
see  V01
them  <ARG1
drving  V01
up  <ARGM-DIR
,  
and  
they  >ARG0
purposely  >ARGM-MNR
block  V01
the  
front  
pull  
-  
up  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
all  
other  
Sear's  >ARG0
use  V01
)  
.  

Once  
inside  
,  
I  >>ARG1
had  V02
to  
stand  V01
around  <ARG2
for  
at  
least  
10  
more  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
before  
--  
FINALLY  >ARGM-TMP
--  
a  
technician  >ARG1
got  V05
to  
me  <ARG2
.  

Once  
I  >>ARG0
returned  V01
to  
pick  V04
up  
my  
car  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
believe  V01
I  >>>ARG1
spent  V02
quite  
a  
bit  
MORE  
time  <ARG1
standing  V01
around  <ARG2
waiting  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG2
had  V01
wanted  V01
to  
split  V01
the  
total  <ARG1
between  
a  
credit  
card  <ARG2
and  
check  
card  
since  
I  >>>ARG2
was  V03
being  V03
reimbursed  V01
for  
the  
tire  <ARG3
but  
was  V03
told  V01
this  >>ARG1
was  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
possible  V01
.  

Once  
I  >ARG1
actually  >ARGM-ADV
got  V05
back  <ARGM-PRD
in  
my  
car  <ARG2
,  
it  >>>ARG0
was  V01
dirty  V02
and  
had  V03
grease  <ARG1
all  
over  
the  
steering  
wheel  
.  

OK  
,  
one  
bad  >ARGM-ADJ
experience  V01
...  
fine  
.  

The  
following  
Friday  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >>>ARG0
returned  V01
with  
my  
car  <ARGM-MNR
to  
go  V06
ahead  <ARG2
and  
replace  V01
the  
other  
3  
tires  >ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG1
were  V01
worn  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
have  V01
gone  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
find  V01
the  
particular  
tire  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
'd  V01
used  V01
in  
stock  <<<ARGM-PRD
anywhere  <<<ARGM-LOC
else  
.  

Once  
again  >ARGM-TMP
,  
I  >ARG1
waited  V01
for  
quite  
a  
bit  <ARGM-TMP
before  
being  V03
attended  V01
to  <ARG1
.  

I  >>>ARG0
got  V04
the  
order  V02
completed  V01
,  
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
questioned  V03
the  
technician  <ARG1
since  
it  >ARG1
came  V09
out  
about  
$  <ARG2
40  
less  
than  
I  >ARG0
expected  V01
.  

He  >>>ARG0
said  V01
it  >>>ARG0
was  V01
the  
same  
tire  <ARG2
,  
and  
verified  V01
this  <ARG1
,  
after  
checking  V01
both  
the  
actual  
tire  <ARG1
on  
my  
car  
and  
my  
service  
papers  
from  
earlier  
in  
the  
week  
.  

However  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
printed  V02
out  
the  
service  >ARG3
quote  V01
,  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
that  
it  >>ARG1
was  V01
NOT  <ARGM-NEG
the  
correct  
tire  <ARG2
,  
and  
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
even  <ARGM-ADV
an  
appropriate  
tire  <ARG2
for  
my  
car  
model  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
pointed  V02
this  <ARG1
out  <C-V
to  
him  <ARGM-GOL
,  
at  
which  
point  >ARGM-TMP
he  >ARG0
said  V01
they  >ARG0
only  >ARGM-ADV
had  V03
one  <ARG1
of  
the  
correct  
tires  
in  
stock  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Ok  
--  
fine  
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
got  V04
just  <ARGM-TMP
my  
other  
rear  
tire  >ARG1
replaced  V01
.  

They  >ARG0
promised  V01
it  >>ARG1
'd  
be  V03
done  V02
within  
an  
hour  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG1
waited  V01
in  
the  
lobby  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Over  
two  
hours  
later  >>>ARGM-TMP
(  
and  
ten  
minutes  
before  
they  >ARG1
closed  V01
)  
my  
car  >>ARG1
was  V03
finally  >ARGM-TMP
finished  V01
.  

A  
few  
minutes  
after  
I  >ARG0
left  V11
,  
I  >>>ARG1
was  V03
called  V02
and  
informed  V01
that  
"  
I  >ARG0
"  
left  V12
my  
wheel  
lock  >>ARG1
(  
which  >>R-ARG1
they  >>ARG0
should  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
left  V12
in  
the  
car  <ARG2
)  
.  

Of  >>ARGM-DIS
course  
,  
they  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
closing  V01
in  
5  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
,  
so  
I  >>>ARG0
would  
have  V02
to  
hurry  V01
up  <ARGM-PRD
or  
get  V01
it  <ARG1
the  
next  
day  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Of  >ARGM-DIS
course  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
make  V14
it  
back  <ARG1
in  
time  <ARGM-TMP
(  
and  
they  >>ARG1
apparently  >ARGM-ADV
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
stay  V01
5  
extra  
minutes  <ARG3
to  
wait  V01
for  
me  <ARG2
)  
.  

The  
next  
day  >ARGM-TMP
,  
no  
one  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
find  V01
my  
wheel  
lock  <ARG1
and  
that  
particular  
technician  >ARG1
was  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
in  <ARG2
.  

Of  >ARGM-DIS
course  
,  
they  >>ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
call  V02
him  <ARG1
either  <ARGM-ADV
to  
ask  V01
about  
it  <ARG1
because  
apparently  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
keep  V01
their  
employees  
'  
phone  
numbers  <ARG1
(  
riiight  
)  
,  
so  
I  >>>ARG0
would  
have  V02
to  
return  V01
on  
Monday  <ARGM-TMP
(  
driving  V01
for  
3  
days  <ARGM-TMP
now  <ARGM-TMP
with  
no  
wheel  
lock  <ARGM-MNR
should  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
get  V01
a  
flat  <ARG1
)  
.  

On  
Monday  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
called  V02
and  
again  >ARGM-TMP
it  
was  V01
a  
big  
to  
-  
do  <ARG2
to  
find  V01
anyone  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
knew  V01
anything  <ARG1
about  
it  
.  

Supposedly  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
holding  V03
it  <ARG1
for  
me  <ARG2
this  
evening  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
sure  V02
that  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-ADV
be  V01
a  
huge  
ordeal  <ARG2
.  

The  
employees  >ARG1
at  
this  
Sear's  
are  V01
completely  
apathetic  <ARG2
and  
there  >>>ARG1
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem  V01
to  
be  V01
any  
sort  <ARG2
of  
management  V01
that  >R-ARG1
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
see  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
return  V01
there  <ARG4
again  <ARGM-TMP
(  
and  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
have  VLV
some  
serious  >ARGM-ADJ
doubts  V01
about  
the  
quality  <ARG1
of  
work  V01
they  <ARG0
actually  <ARGM-ADV
performed  VLV
on  
my  
car  <<ARG1
)  
.
