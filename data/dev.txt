He  >>ARG1

killed*  
years

the  
israelians  >ARG0
have*  
all  
the  
reasons  <ARG1

since  
he  >ARG0

he  >ARG1

Today

his  >ARG0

killing*  
several

near  
Habbaniyah  <ARGM-LOC

the  
Sunni

,  
but  
this  
time  >>ARGM-TMP

safe*

In  
Fallujah  >ARGM-LOC

hundreds  >ARG1

out  <ARGM-DIR

a

(  
I  >ARG0

that  
the

an  
enormous  
amount  <ARG1

information  
from

because  
otherwise  >>ARGM-ADV

a

bad  >ARGM-ADJ

.  

The  
US  
troops  >>ARG0
fired*  
into  
the  
hostile  
crowd  <ARGM-GOL
,  
killing*  
4  <ARG1

It  >>ARG1
seems*  
clear*  
to  
me  <<ARG2
that  
the  
manhunt  >>ARG1
for  
high  
Baath  
officials  
in  
the  
Sunni  
heartland  
is*  
being*  
done*  
wrong  <ARGM-MNR
,  
or  
at

in  
ways*  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1

bad*  
for

Google  >>ARG0

finally  >ARGM-TMP

an

a  
chance*

just  >ARGM-ADV

this

"  
Arafat  
's  
secular

by  
the

The  
hottest  
item  >ARG1
on  
Christmas  
wish  
lists  
this  
year  
is*  
nuclear  
weapons  <ARG2

Al

them  <ARG1

Iran  >ARG0
wants*  
them  <ARG1

Russia  >ARG0

the

all  >>ARG1

wants*  
is*  
to  
give*  
them  <ARG2
all  
a  
piece  <ARG1
of  
coal  
.  

For  
the  
last  
few  
years  >>ARGM-TMP
there  
have*  
been*  
tensions*  
with  
Iran  
’s  
nuclear  
program  <ARG0
with  
word  >ARG1
coming*  
this  
week  <ARGM-TMP
that  
a  
deal*  >>ARG1
was*  
reached*  
through  
the  
European  
Union  <ARGM-MNR
that  >R-ARG1
meets*  
with  
the  
approval*  
of  
the  
International  
Atomic  
Energy  
Agency  <ARG1
.  

At  
the  
same  
time  >ARGM-TMP
,  
an  
Iranian  
Opposition  
Group  >ARG0
released*  
what  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
call*  
proof*  
of  
a  
covert  
nuclear  
weapons  
program  <ARG1
.  

Arial  >ARGM-ADJ

,  
loose  >ARGM-ADJ
connections*

AQ  <ARG2

and  
Libya  
make*  
up  
the  
evidence  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
the  
group  >ARG0
presented*  
.  

Russia  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
announced*  
that  
it  >>ARG0
was*  
seeking*  
and  
building*  
the  
best  
nukes  >>ARG1
the  
world  >>ARG0
’s*  
ever  >ARGM-TMP
seen*  
.  

President  >ARG0
Vladimir  
Putin  
said*  
Russia  >ARG0
is  
will  >ARGM-MOD
have*  
new  
nuclear  
weapons  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
other  
countries  >>ARG0
do*  
not  
and  
will  
not  
have*  
.  

With  
the  
demand*  >ARG1
so  >ARGM-EXT
high*  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
the  
question*  >ARG1
arises*  
on  
to  
who  >>ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
or  
has*  
the  
right*  
to  
be*  
the  
Santa  <ARG2
of  
nuclear  
weapons  
.  

Right  
now  >ARGM-TMP
that  >>ARG1
seems*  
to  
be*  
the  
US  <ARG2
,  
EU  
,  
and  
IAEA  
.  

But  
not  
always  >>ARGM-TMP
do*  
those  
three  >ARG0
agree*  
,  
and  
not  
always  >>ARGM-TMP
are*  
their  >ARG0
decisions*  >ARG1
equal*  
.  

The  
US  >>ARG0
has*  
strongly  >ARGM-EXT
opposed*  
a  
nuclear  
weapons  
program  <ARG1
of  
Iran  
,  
yet  
Israel  >>ARG1
,  
which  >>R-ARG0
to  
this  
day  >>ARGM-TMP
has*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
officially  >ARGM-MNR
said*  
that  
they  >ARG0
posses*  
nuclear  
weapons  <ARG1
,  
ranks*  
around  
fifth  <ARG2
in  
nuclear  
strength  <ARG4
.  

It  
is*  
estimated*  
that  
Israel  >ARG0
has*  
over  
200  
nuclear  
weapons  <ARG1
yet  
neither  
the  
US  >ARG0
nor  
any  
of  
her  
allies  
expresses*  
the  
slightest  >ARGM-EXT
concern*  
.  

North  
Korea  
’s  
Kim  >ARG0
Jong  
Ill  
also  >ARGM-DIS
has*  
the  
bomb  <ARG1
at  
the  
top  <ARGM-LOC
of  
his  
list  
and  
Santa  >>ARG1
seems*  
to  
have*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
come*  
a  
few  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >>ARG1
is*  
rumored*  
that  
North  
Korea  >ARG0
has*  
at  
least  
a  
couple  
nuclear  
weapons  <ARG1
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
getting*  >>ARG1
past  
who  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
them  <ARG1
,  
is*  
who  >>ARG1
has*  
them  <ARG1
,  
and  
who  >>R-ARG1
is*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
close*  
.  

The  
case*  >>ARG2
against  
Iran  <ARG2
has*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
feeling*  
of  
Déjà  
vu  <ARG1
.

somewhat  
like  
those  <<ARGM-MNR
of  
chemical

stockpiles  
in  
Iraq  
.  

America  >ARG0
cried*  
wolf  <ARG1
in  
Iraq  <ARGM-LOC
,  
and  
what  >>ARG0
’s*  
scary*  >ARG1
is*  
that  
sooner  >ARGM-TMP
or  
later  
,  
that  
wolf  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
probably  >ARGM-ADV
get*  
us  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
ran*  
across  
this  
item  <ARG1
on  
the  
Internet  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Sooooo  
.  

The  
United  
States  >>ARG0
goes*  
into  
a  
war  
zone  <ARG4
and  
evacuates*  
a  
bunch  >ARG1
of  
U.S.  
citizens  
(  
most  >R-ARG1
of  
whom  
were*  
"  
dual  
-  
citizens  <ARG2
"  
)  
.  

Then  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
eschewing*  >>ARGM-ADV
normal  >ARGM-ADJ
procedure*  
,  
the  
Department  >ARG0
of  
State  
waived*  
the  
fees  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
they  >ARG0
charge*  
for  
evacuating*  
U.S.  
citizen  <ARG2
.  

Why  
?  

To  
pander*  
to  
the  
mythical  
"  
Arab  
street  <ARG1
"  
,  
of  
course  
.  

Now  >ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
argue*  
that  
one  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
reasonably  >ARGM-ADV
predicted*  
that  
some  
form  >>ARG1
of  
military  
violence  
was*  
likely*  
to  
occur*  
in  
Lebanon  <ARGM-LOC
(  
considering*  
that  
the  
country  >>ARG0
has*  
been*  
experiencing*  
some  
form  <ARG1
of  
conflict*  
for  
approximately  
the  
last  
32  
years  <<ARGM-TMP
)  
.  

In  
other  
words  >ARGM-ADV
,  
those  
Americans  >>ARG1
were*  
there  <ARG2
by  
their  >ARG0
own  >ARGM-REC
choice*  
,  
mired*  
in  
a  
situation  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
was*  
totally  >ARGM-EXT
predictable*  
.  

Yet  >>ARGM-DIS
we  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
charge*  
them  <ARG2
for  
the  
evacuation*  
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
unlike  
the  
situation  <ARG2
last  
year  
in  
Asia  
when  
we  >ARG0
evacuated*  
U.S.  
citizens  <ARG2
from  
areas  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
were*  
hit*  
by  
the  
tsunami*  
-  
a  
phenomenon  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is*  
much  
less  >ARGM-CXN
predictable*  
than  
the  
Hezbollah  
-  
provoked  >ARGM-CAU
destruction*  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
rained*  
down  <ARGM-DIR
on  
Lebanon  <ARG2
.  

And  
what  >>ARG1
do*  
we  >ARG0
get*  
for  
this  
effort*  
?  

A  
lawsuit  
.  

That  >>ARG2
's*  
right*  
,  
folks  <ARGM-DIS
.  

The  
American  
-  
Arab  
Discrimination  
Committee  >>ARG0
is*  
suing*  
Condoleeza  <ARG1
Rice  
and  
Donald  
Rumsfeld  
,  
charging*  
that  
they  >ARG0

the  
evacuation  >ARG1

so  
we  >ARG0

another  
announcement*  
on  
March  <ARGM-TMP

,

I  >>ARG0

to  
use*  
this  
opportunity  <ARG1
to  
welcome*  
Brian  <ARG1
Ryner  
to

Brian  >>ARG1

Great

you  <ARG1
on

Now  >>ARGM-TMP

none  >>ARG1
of  
this  
has*  
been*  
confirmed*  
by  
Google  <ARG0
at  
the  
present  
time  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
it  >ARG1
's*  
an  
old  
adage  <ARG2
that  
you  >>ARG0
follow*  
the  
money  <ARG2
to  
see*  
who  >ARG1
is*  
behind  
something  <ARG2
.  

In  
this  
case*  
,  
following*  >ARG0
the  
talent  <ARG2
leads*  
me  >ARG0
to  
think*  
that  
Google  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
making*  >ARGM-LVB
an  
announcement*  >ARG0

the

you  >>ARG0
have*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
already  >ARGM-TMP
seen*  >>ARGM-ADV

Flash  
movie  <ARG1

you  >>ARG1

take*  
a  
few  
minutes  <ARG1
and  
view*  
the  
future  
history  <ARG1
of

as  
conceived*  
by  
Robin  <ARG0
Sloan  
and  
Matt  
Thompson  
,  
with  
music  <ARGM-ADV

McLeran

In  
this  
movie  >ARGM-LOC

Amazon  
(

create*  
a  
brave  
new  
world  <ARG1

This  >ARG1

one  
thought  
-  
provoking  
film  <ARG2

Every  
move*  >>ARG0

brings*  
this

future  <ARG1

Just  
one  
small  
commment

it  
's*  
not  >ARGM-NEG

as  
far  <ARGM-ADV

the  
point  >>ARGM-ADV
where  >>R-ARGM-ADV
it  >>ARG0
has*  
turned*  
even  
Iraqi  
Shiites  >>ARG0
,  
who  >>R-ARG0
were*  
initially  >ARGM-TMP
grateful*  
for  
the  
removal*  
of  
Saddam  <ARG1
Hussein  
,  
against  
the  
United  
States  <<ARG2
?  

Where  >ARGM-ADV
it  >>ARG0
risks*  
fighting*  
dual  
Sunni  
Arab  
and  
Shiite  
insurgencies  <ARG1
simultaneously  <ARGM-TMP
,  
at  
a  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
when  >>R-ARGM-TMP
US  
troops  >>ARG0
are*  
rotating*  
on  
a  
massive  
scale  <ARGM-EXT
and  
hoping*  
to  
downsize*  
their  
forces  <ARG1
in  
country  
?  

At  
a  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
when  >>R-ARGM-TMP
the  
Spanish  
,  
Thai  
and  
other  
contingents  >>ARG1
are*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
committed*  
to  
leaving*

and  
the  
UN  >>ARG1
is*  
reluctant*  
to  
get*  
involved*  
?  

One  
answer*  >ARG1
is*  
that  
the  
Pentagon  >ARG0
prevented*  
the  
State  
Department  <ARG1
from  
running*  
the  
CPA  <ARG1
.  

State  >ARG1
is*  
the  
body  <ARG2
with  
experience*  
in  
international  
affairs  <ARG1
and  
administration*  
.  

The  
civilians  >ARG0
in  
the  
Department  
of  
Defense  
only  >ARGM-ADV
know*  
how  >ARGM-MNR
to  
blow*  
things  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

Rumsfeld  >ARG0
,  
Wolfowitz  
and  
Feith  
staffed*  
the  
CPA  <ARG1
with  
Neoconservatives  >>ARG0
,  
most  >>R-ARG0
of  
whom  
had*  >ARGM-LVB
no  >ARGM-NEG
administrative  >ARG1
experience*  
,  
no  
Arabic  
,  
and  
no  
respect*  
for  
Muslim  
culture  <ARG1
(  
or  
knowledge  
about  
it  
)  
.  

They  >ARG0
actively  >ARGM-MNR
excluded*

Iraq  
hands  <ARG1
like  
Tom

Only  
recently  >>ARGM-TMP

)  

The  
Neocons  >ARG0
in  
the  
CPA  
have*  
all  
sorts  <ARG1
of  
ulterior  
motives  
and  
social  >ARG1
experiments*

the  
Iraqi

including

some  
sort  
of

and  
maybe  >ARGM-ADV
even  >ARGM-ADV
breaking*  
the

three  
parts  <ARG2

Commission  
member  
Philip  >>ARG0
Zelikow  
,  
who  >>R-ARG1
is*  
close*  
to  
the  
Bush  >ARG0
administration*  
,  
admitted*  
on  
Sept.  <ARGM-TMP
10  
,  
2002  
,  
that  
the  
ulterior  
motive  >>ARG1
of  
the  
Bush  >ARG0
administration*  
for  
the  
Iraq  
War  
was*  
to  
"  
protect*  
Israel  <ARG1
,  
"  
according  
to  
the  
Asian  
Times  <<ARGM-ADV
.  

I  >>ARG1
have*  
long  >ARGM-TMP
been*  
a  
trenchant  
critic  <ARG2
of  
the  
Sadrists  
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG1
have*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
been*  
up  
to  
anything  <ARG2
extraordinary  
as  
far  <ARGM-ADV
as  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
see*  
in  
recent  
weeks  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Someone  >>ARG0
in  
the  
CPA  
sat*  
down  
and  
thought*  
up  
ways*  >ARGM-MNR
to  
stir*  
them  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-PRD
by  
closing*  
their  
newspaper  <ARG1
and  
issuing*  
28  
arrest  
warrants  <ARG1
and  
taking*  
in  
people  <ARG1
like  
Yaqubi  
.  

This  >>ARG1
is*  
either  
gross  
incompetence  <ARG2
or  
was*  
done*  
with  
dark  
ulterior  
motives  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
can  >>ARGM-MOD
scarcely  >>ARGM-ADV
be*  
guessed*  
at  <C-ARG1
.  

There  
is*  
a  
classical  
logical  
fallacy  <ARG1
,  
post  
hoc  
ergo  
propter  
hoc  
(  
Z  >ARG1
happens*  
after  
X  <ARGM-TMP
,  
therefore  >>ARGM-ADV
Z  >>ARG1
is*  
caused*  
by  
X  <ARG0
)  
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
keep*  
revising*  
this  
posting*  
this  
evening  <<ARGM-TMP
because  
I  >>ARG1
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
fall*  
into  
it  <ARG2
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
sometimes  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
of  >>ARGM-ADV
course  
,  
when  >ARGM-TMP
Z  >ARG1
happens*  >ARGM-TMP
after  
X  <ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
is*  
because  
of  
X  <ARG2
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
as  >ARGM-ADV
well  
just  >ARGM-ADV
come*  
out  
with  
it  <ARG1
:  
It  
is*  
pretty  
suspicious  <ARG2
,  
given  
the  
Neocon  
predominance  <ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
CPA  
and  
in  
the  
upper  
reaches  
of  
the  
Defense  
Department  
that  
on  
April  >ARGM-TMP
2  
AP  >ARG0
reported*  
of  
Muqtada  <ARG1
:  

'  
A

said*  
that  
he  
should  >>ARGM-MOD

the

"  
striking  
arm  <ARG1

in  
Iraq  
.  

"  
I  >>ARG0
have*  
said*  >>ARG1
and  
I  >ARG0
repeat*  
my  >ARG0
expression*  
of  
solidarity  >>ARGM-ADV
which  >R-ARG1
Hassan  >ARG0
Nasrallah  
called*  
for  <C-ARG1
to  
stand*  
with  
Hamas  <ARGM-COM
,  
"  
Shiite  
cleric  
Muqtada  >ARG0
al

Sadr

Friday  <ARGM-TMP
in  
a  
reference*  
to  
Nasrallah  <ARG1

the  
leader  
of  
the  
militant  
Lebanese  
Shiite  
group  
Hezbollah

Last  
month  >ARGM-TMP

Nasrallah  >ARG0
announced*  
that  
his  
party  >ARG0

close*  
ranks  <ARG1

"  
Let*  >>ARG1
(  
Hamas  >ARG0
)  
consider*  
me  <ARG1
their  
striking  
arm  <ARG1
in  
Iraq  
because  
the  
fate  >ARG1

Iraq  
and  
Palestine  
is*  
the  
same  <ARG2
,  
"  
al  >ARG0
-  
Sadr  
said*  
during  
a  
Friday  
prayer  
sermon  <ARGM-TMP
in  
Kufa  
,  
his  
home  
base  
south  
of  
Baghdad  
.  

He  >>ARG0
did*  
comment*  
on  
what  >ARG2
he  >ARG0
meant*  
by  
the  
phrase  <ARG1
.  
'  

And  
on  
April  >>ARGM-TMP
3  
his  
chief  
aide  >>ARG1
in  
Najaf  
was*  
suddenly  >ARGM-TMP
arrested*  
along  
with  
13  
other  
members  <ARGM-ADV
of  
his  
organization  
,  
and  
the  
Coalition  
forces  >>ARG1
are*  
put*  
into  
violent  >ARGM-MNR
conflict*  >ARG0
with  
his  
organization  <ARG1
,  
which  >R-ARG0
leaves*  
7  
US  
soldiers  <ARG1
dead  <ARG1
.  

The  
Army  >>ARG0
is*  
unlikely*  
to  
forgive*  
or  
forget*  
;  
but  
who  >ARG0
provoked*  
it  <ARG1
and  
why  
?  

I  >ARG1
'm*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
even  <ARGM-ADV
in  
Iraq  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have*  
predicted*  
to  
you  <ARGM-GOL
the  
consequences  <ARG1
of  
doing*  
what  >>ARG1
the  
CPA  >>ARG0
has*  
been*  
doing*  
.  

Anthony  >ARG0
Shadid  
of  
the  
Washington

reveals*  
that  
the  
warrants  >>ARG1

the

had*  
been*  
issued*  
months

Why  >>ARGM-CAU

i  >>ARG0

a

All  
:  

It  
is*  
my  >ARG0
understanding*  
,  
from  
good  
sources  <<ARGM-DIR
in  
the  
Gov  
s  
office  
that  
the  
Gov  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
order*  
Loretta  >ARG0
Lynch  
to  
expeditiously  >ARGM-ADV
implement*  
the  
provision*  >ARG0
to  
suspend*  
all  
parties  
auhtority  <ARG1
to  
enter*  
into  
direct  >ARGM-MNR
access*  
contracts  <<ARG1
.  

The  
premise  >>ARG1
with  
which  >>R-ARG1
the  
administartion  >>ARG0
is*  
acting*  
is*  
that  
if  
they  >ARG0
expeditiously  >ARGM-MNR
suspend*  >>ARGM-ADV
everyone  >ARG1
's  
right*  
to  
bilateral  
contracts  <ARG2
quickly  <<ARGM-MNR
,  
it  >ARG0
sets*  
up  
a  
barrier  >>ARG1
which  >>R-ARG1
the  
direct  >ARGM-MNR
access*  
coalition  >ARG0
must  >ARGM-MOD
break*  
through*  
.  

In  
other  
words  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
table  >>ARG1
is*  
set*  
.  

Deal*  
your  
meal  >>ARGM-LOC
from  
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
the  
dishes  >>ARG1
are*  
located*  
.  

I.E.  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
Davis  >ARG0
Administration*  >>ARG0
wants*  
to  
place*  
all  
direct  
access  
advocates  <ARG1
in  
the  
position  <ARG2
of  
having*  
to  
justify*  
why  >ARGM-CAU
each  
and  
every  
party  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
the  
exception*  
to  
the  
suspension*  
rather  
than  
have*  
a  
general  >ARGM-ADJ
rule*  
concerning  
how  >>ARGM-MNR
direct  >ARGM-MNR
access*  >ARG1
should  >ARGM-MOD
work*  
for  
all  
parties  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG0
clearly  >ARGM-ADV
gives*  
the  
Admin  <ARG2
a  
very  
strong  
upper  
hand  >ARGM-MNR
to  
control*  
who  >>ARG2
when  >>ARG2
and  
where  
direct  >ARGM-MNR
access*  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
occur*  
without  
having*  
to  
say*  
that  
they  >ARG0
oppose*  
direct  >ARGM-MNR
access*  
.  

Power  >ARG1

where  >ARG2
power  >ARG1

you  >>ARG0

sixth  >>ARG1
,  
that  >>R-ARG1

He  >>ARG0

My

It  >>ARG0
is*  
n't  <ARGM-NEG
about  
finding*  
the  
meaning*  
of

at  
work*  
.  

It  >ARG1

all

the

Dear  
All

My

Visit

I  >>ARG0
used*  
to  
e-mail*  
Vince  <ARG2
Kaminski  
about  
the  
advice  <ARG1
on  
his  
article  
"  
The  
Challenge  
of  
Pricing*  
and  
Risk  >ARGM-ADJ
Managing*  
Electricity  
Derivatives  <ARG1
"  
and  
he  >>ARG0
had*  
mailed*  
me  <ARG2
the

.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
modelling*  
the  
Queensland

using*  
Geometric  >>ARGM-ADJ
Brownian  >>ARGM-ADJ
Mean  >ARG2
Reverting*  >>ARGM-ADJ
Jump  >ARGM-MNR
Diffusion*  >ARG1
Model*  
and  
have*  
followed*  
your  
paper  <ARG1
"  
Making*  
the  
most  <ARG1
of  
mean  
reversion  <ARG2
"  
to  
estimate*  
the  
mean  
reversion*  
speed  <ARG1
.  

I  >ARG0
use*  
Queensland  >ARGM-LOC
half

hourly  >ARGM-TMP

during  
13  
December  <<ARGM-TMP

30  
June  
2001  
giving*  
about  
44,000  
price  >ARG3
observations*  
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
the  
result  >ARG1
from  
Ordinary  
Least  
Squares  
was*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
as  
expected*  
due  
to  
different  >ARGM-ADJ
sign*  
for  
both  
slope  <ARG1
&  
intercept  
.  

The  
coefficient  >>ARG1
and  
standard  >ARGM-ADJ
error*  
are*  
as  
followed*  
:  

Intercept  
:  
-  
0.3931  
(  
0.0076  
)  

Slope  
:  
0.1171  
(  
0.0022  
)  

R  
Square  
:  
0.0585  

Therefore  >ARGM-DIS
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
estimate*  
the  
mean  
reversion*  
rate  <ARG1
as  
the  
estimated  
slope  >ARG0
has*  
the  
positive  >ARG1
sign*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
also  >ARGM-DIS
tried*  
monthly  
data  <ARG1
and  
the

Traci

I  >>ARG0
have*  
visited*  
Georgia  
Tech  <ARG1
on  
Thursday  <ARGM-TMP
.  

One  >ARG0

the

indicated*  
that  
he  >>ARG1
is*  
interested*  
in  
a  
summer  
internship  <ARG2
.  

He  >ARG1
came*  
across  
as  
a  
very  
bright  
person  <ARG3
,  
very  
personable  
.  

I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD

Dear  
Dr.  
Vincent  
Kaminski  
,  

Hi  
.  

How  >>ARGM-MNR
are*  
you  >ARG0
doing*  
?  

I  >ARG0
hope*  
you  >>ARG1
have*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
flight*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
to  
home  
.  

It  
was*  
a  
good  
opportunity  <ARG2
to  
know*  
about  
Enron  <ARG1
and  
its  
finance  
sector  
.  

Thank*  
you  <ARG1
for  
your  
time  <ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
already  >ARGM-TMP
submitted*  
my  
resume  <ARG1
and  
cover  
letter  
right  
after  
the  
talk*  
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
you  >ARG0
ask*  
me  >ARG0
to  
send*  
a  
copy*  
of  
resume  <ARG1
and  
cover  
letter  
again  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

Those  
attachments*  >ARG1
are*  
what  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG2
was*  
asked*  
.  

Again  >ARGM-ADV
,  
it  >ARG1
was*  
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
chance*  
for  
me  >>ARG0
to  
get*  
to  
know*  
what  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do*  
in  
this  
field  <ARGM-LOC
and  
what  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG0
have*  
to  
more  >ARGM-EXT
focus*  
on  <C-ARG2
in  
school  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
looking*  
forward  
to  
hearing*  
from  
you  <ARG2
soon  <ARGM-TMP
and  
have*  
a  
nice  
day  <ARG1
.  

Thank*  
you  <ARG1

law  >ARG1
works*  
,  
the  
tax  
basis  >>ARG1
for

will  >>ARGM-MOD

based*  
on  
the

the

preceding*

As  
such  >ARGM-ADV

we  >>ARG0

calculating*  
the

at

the  
day  <<ARGM-TMP
prior  
to

We  >>ARG0

If

to

the

with  
a

we  >ARG0

Please  >ARGM-DIS

If

Renee

Thank*  
you  <ARG1
for  
digging*  
in  <ARG2
to  
the  
issue*  
of  
Deferred*  
Phantom  
Stock

It  
is*  
clear*  
that  
the  
payment*  >>ARGM-PRR
will  
be*  
made*  
in  
shares*  
.  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
still  >>ARGM-TMP
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
understand*  
which  
date  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
used*  
to  
determine*  
the  
value  <ARG1
and  
calculate*  
how  
many  >ARGM-EXT

.  

The

Amount  >ARG1
of

reads*  
"  
The

Can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
help*  
me  >>ARG0

Let*  
me  >ARG0
know*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
get*  
the  
quotes*  
from  
Pauline  <<ARG2
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
expecting*  
to  
pay*  
something  <ARG1
in  
the  
$  
3,  
to  
$  
5,000  
range  
.  

I  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like*  
to  
see*  
the  
quotes*  
and  
a  
description*  
of  
the  
work*  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
done*  
.  

It  >ARG1
is*  
my  >ARG0
understanding*  
that  
some  
rock  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
removed*  
and  
replaced*  
with  
siding  <ARG2
.  

If  
they  >>ARG0
are*  
getting*  >>ARGM-ADV
quotes*  >ARGM-ADV
to  
put*  
up  <ARG2
new  
rock  <ARG1
then  >ARGM-ADV
we  >>ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need*  
to  
clarify*  
.  

Jacques  >>ARG0
is*  
ready*  
to  
drop*  
in  <ARGM-PRD
a  
dollar  
amount  <ARG1
on  
the  
release*  
.  

If  
the  
negotiations*  >ARG1
stall*  >ARGM-ADV
,  
it  >ARG1
seems*  
like  
I  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
go*  
ahead  <ARG2
and  
cut*  
off  
the  
utilities  <ARG1

Hopefully  >ARGM-ADV
things  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
smoothly  <ARGM-MNR

Several  
years  
ago  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
developed*  
a  
short  >ARGM-ADJ
paper  >ARGM-MNR
and  
pencil  
screening  >ARGM-ADJ
test*  >>ARG0
which  >>R-ARG0
,  
in  
a  
small  >ARGM-ADJ
pilot  >ARGM-ADJ
study*  >ARGM-LOC
,  
discriminated*  
between  
ADHD  <ARG1
,  
LD  
,  
and  
control  
subjects  
.  

I  >ARG0
recently  >ARGM-TMP
converted*  
this  
test*  
to  
an  
online  >ARGM-ADJ
test*  
in  
order  
to  
norm*  
it  <ARG1
to  
a  
larger  >ARGM-ADJ
population*  
and  
,  
subsequently  >ARGM-TMP
,  
to  
make*  
it  >ARG2
available*  
to  
any  
one  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
has*  
access*  
to  
a  
computer  <ARG1
and  
the  
Internet  
.  

The  
test*  >ARG1
itself  <ARGM-REC
is*  
what  >>ARG1
is*  
called*  
a  
substitution  >ARG2
test*  
.  

It  >ARG0
has*  
two  
parts  >>ARG1
,  
both  >>R-ARG1
of  
which  
are*  
timed*  
for  
90  
seconds  <ARG2
each  
and  
the  
differential  >>ARG0
between  
the  
resulting*  >ARGM-ADJ
two  
scores*  
determines*  
the  
likelihood  <ARG1
of  
having*  
a  
learning  
disability  <ARG1
or  
attention  
deficit  
disorder  
.  

I  >>ARG0
am*  
in  
need*  
of  
test  
subjects  <ARG1
and  
hope*  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
it  <ARG1
.  

The  
test*  >>ARG2
,  
along  
with  
an  
information  
form  <ARGM-ADJ
,  
is*  
available*  
at  <ARGM-LOC
:  
.  

I  >ARG0
think*  
a  
test*  >>ARG1
like  
this  
one  <ARGM-ADJ
is*  
much  >ARGM-EXT
needed*  
.  

A  
person  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
it  <ARG1
directly  <ARGM-MNR
instead  
of  
others  >ARG0
completing*  
behavioral  
checklists  <ARG1
or  
a  
completing*  
a  
lengthy  >ARGM-ADJ
program  
intensive  >ARGM-ADJ
test*  
like  
TOVA  <ARGM-ADJ
.  

Perhaps  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
are*  
willing*  
to  
recommend*  
this  
site  <ARG1
and  
,  
if  
you  >ARG0
have*  >ARGM-ADV
a  
website  <ARG1
,  
place*  
a  
link  <ARG1
on  
your  
website  <ARG2
.  

are*  
there  
any  
sadists  >ARG0
out  
there  <ARGM-LOC
who  >R-ARG0
share*  
the  
same  >ARGM-ADJ
tastes*  
as  
i  
do*  
?  

i  >>ARG0
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
what  >ARG2
it  >ARG1
is*  
,  
but  
since  
a  
very  
young  
age  >>ARGM-TMP
i  >>ARG1
have*  
had*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
strange  >ARGM-ADJ
but  
very  
gratifying  
urge*  
to  
torture*  
or  
maime*  
animals  <ARG1
.  

i  >>ARG1
am*  
deadly  >ARGM-ADV
serious*  
,  
i  >>ARG0
really  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
get*  
sexual  
releif  <ARG1
from  
even  >ARGM-ADV
hearing*  
of  
torture*  
of  
animals  <ARG1
,  
now  >ARGM-TMP
some  
people  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
call*  
me  <ARG1
a  
brute  <ARG2
or  
a  
coward  
but  
i  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
nt  >ARGM-NEG
help*  
my  >ARG0
true  >ARGM-ADJ

.  

badger  >ARG1
baiting*  >ARG1
is*  
natrually  <ARGM-ADV
a

on*  
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
i  >ARG0
thought*  
a

Once  
upon  
a  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
(  
in  
2001  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
to  
be*  
specific  <ARG2
)  
,  
the  
Coca  
-  
Cola  
corporation  >ARG0
built*  
a  
bottling  
plant  <ARG1
in  
a  
small  
and  
remote  
Indian  
village  <ARGM-LOC
in  
the  
state  
of  
Kerala  
.  

In  
exchange*  >>ARGM-ADV
for  
sucking*  
vast  
amounts  <ARG1
of  
water  
out  
of  
the  
local  
land  <ARG2
,  
the  
mighty  
corporation  >>ARG0
promised*  
to  
bring*  
the  
people  <ARG2
great  
wealth  <ARG1
.  

But  
within  
a  
few  
short  
months  >ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
village  
people  >>ARG0
began*  
to  
notice*  
their  
wells  >>ARG1
were*  
running*  
dry  <ARGM-PRD
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG0
complained*  
to  
the  
corporation  <ARG2
.  

Coca  
-  
Cola  >>ARG0
calmed*  
the  
concerns*  
of  
the  
people  <ARG1
and  
attempted*  
to  
win*  
back  <ARGM-DIR
their  
favor  <ARG1
by  
giving*  
them  <ARG2
vast  
amounts  <ARG1
of  
free  
fertilizer  
,  
saying*  
it  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
grow*  
bountiful  
crops  <ARG1
beyond  
their  >ARG0
wildest  >ARGM-ADJ
dreams*  
.  

After  
several  
years  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
use*  
,  
we  >ARG1
arrive*  
at  
the  
present  
day  >>ARGM-TMP
when  >>R-ARGM-TMP
the  
village  
people  >>ARG0
have*  
suddenly  >ARGM-TMP
discovered*  
the  
fertilizer  >>ARG1
is*  
actually  <ARGM-ADV
the  
bottling  
plant  
's  
waste  
sludge  <ARG2
and  
is*  
laden  <ARG2
with  
cadmium  
,  
a  
highly  
toxic  
,  
cancer  
-  
causing  
heavy  
metal  
.  

The  
village  
soil  >>ARG0
and  
water  
are*  
now  >ARGM-TMP
too  
heavily  >ARGM-EXT
contaminated*  
to  
safely  >ARGM-MNR
occupy*  
human  
life  <ARG1
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
plant  >>ARG1
was*  
shut*  
down  
last  
week  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Moral  
of  
the  
story  
:  
Do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
drink*  
Coke  <ARG1
..........  
drink*  
Pepsi  <ARG1
!  

Just  >ARGM-ADV
kidding*  
,  
Pepsi  >ARG1
is*  
actually  <ARGM-ADV
in  
the  
process*  
of  
being*  
thrown*  
out  
of  
India  <ARG2
for  
similar  
crimes  <ARGM-PRP
,  
as  <ARGM-DIS
well

The  
Greater  
New  
Orleans  
Fair  
Housing  
Action  
Center  >ARG0
(  
GNOFHAC  
)  
filed*  
a  
housing  >ARGM-MNR
discrimination*  >ARG1
complaint*  
against  
the  
Housing  
Authority  <ARG2
of  
New  
Orleans  
(  
HANO  
)  
last  
week  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
complaint*  >>ARG0
,  
filed*  
with  
the  
United  
States  
Department  <ARG2
of  
Housing  
and  
Urban  
Development  
,  
accuses*  
HANO  <ARG1
of  
violating*  
a  
2003  
enforcement  >ARG1
agreement*  
entered*  
into  <ARG1
between  
former  
St.  
Thomas  
Housing  
Development  
residents  <ARG0
,  
the  
City  
of  
New

HANO  
,  
and  
the  
U.S.  
Department  
of  
Housing

Urban  
Development  
during  
the  
HOPE  
VI  
redevelopment  <ARGM-TMP
of  
St.  >ARG1
Thomas  
,  
now  >ARGM-TMP
known*  
as  
River  
Garden  <ARG2
.  

The  
current  >ARGM-TMP
complaints*  >ARG0
allege*  
that  
HANO  >>ARG0
has*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
provided*  
qualified  
former  
St.  
Thomas  
residents  <ARG2
a  
preference*  
with  
respect*  
to  
available  
public  >ARGM-ADJ
housing*  
units  <<ARG1
at  
River  
Garden  
per  
the  
2003  >ARGM-TMP
agreement*  
.  

Upon  
return*  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
New  
Orleans  <ARG4
after  
the  
Hurricane  
Katrina  >ARGM-CAU
evacuation*  
,  
former  
residents  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
informed*  
that  
there  
are*  
no  
available  
public  >ARGM-ADJ
housing*  
units  <<ARG1
at  
River  
Garden  
because  
those  
units  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
reserved*  
for  
HANO  
employees  <ARG2
.  

Therefore  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
public  >ARGM-ADJ
housing*  
residents  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
unable*  
to  
secure*  
the  
units  >ARG2
for  
which  >R-ARG2
they  >ARG1
qualified*  
prior  
to  
the  
storm  <ARGM-TMP
and  
are*  
left*  
homeless*  
,  
as  
a  
result  <<ARGM-CAU
.  

"  
In  
the  
wake  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
Hurricane  
Katrina  
,  
affordable  >ARGM-ADJ
housing*  >>ARG1
in  
New  
Orleans  <ARG2
is*  
more  >ARGM-CXN
scarce*  
than  
ever  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

As  
such  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
it  
is*  
essential*  >>ARG1
that  
HANO  >ARG0
comply*  
with  
2003  >ARGM-TMP

himself  
from  
what  >ARG1

today  <ARGM-TMP

,  
called*  
the  
refugee  >ARG0
issue*  >>ARG0
"  
very  >ARGM-EXT
important*  
and  
very  >ARGM-EXT
dangerous*

"  

Having*  
personally  >ARGM-ADV
visited*  >ARGM-ADV
the  
West  
Bank  <ARG1
and  
Israel  
,  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD

that

not  >ARGM-NEG

former  >ARGM-TMP
thinking*  
and  
continues*  
the

,  
then  >ARGM-ADV

peace*

The  
Palestinian  
militant  
organisation  >>ARG0
Hamas  
has*  
announced*  
an  
end*  
to  
rocket  >ARG2
attacks*  
on  
Israel  <ARG1
from  
the  
Gaza  
Strip  <ARGM-DIR
after  
a  
weekend  <<ARGM-TMP
of  
escalating  
violence  
.  

Up  
to  
40  
rockets  >>ARG1
had*  
been*  
fired*  
at  
Israel  <ARGM-DIR
,  
weeks  
after

In  
response*  >ARGM-CAU

overnight  <<ARGM-TMP

It  >ARG0
looks*  
as  
if

thrown*  
in  <ARG2
the  
towel  <ARG1

it's  
former  
leader  <ARG1
,  
Muhammed

Hamas  >>ARG1
has*  
become*  
rather  <ARG2

in  
Gaza  <ARGM-LOC
,  
as  
many  >ARG0

as

towards  
the  
rocket  >ARGM-MNR

upon

soil  <ARG1

Egypt  >>ARG0

a

play*  
as  
they  >ARG0
convinced*  
Hamas  >ARG0
to  
end*  
the

,  
although  
the

Help*

about  
a

I  >ARG0
like*  
Hayes

....  
another  
plus  >ARGM-ADV
,  
it  >ARG1
's*  
right  
by  
Civic

,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
take*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
romantic  >ARGM-ADJ
walk*  
around  
the  
Opera

What  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
happen*  
if  
you  >ARG0
flew*  
the

South

in  
Modern

Vietnam  <ARGM-LOC
?  

It  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
similar*

flying*

Third

Germany  <ARGM-LOC

in

.  

You  >>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
violating*  
the

The  
police  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
make*  
you  >ARG0
take*  
it  <ARG1
down  <C-V

you  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD

fines  <ARG1
and  
imprisonment  
(  
but  
definitely  >ARGM-ADV
not  >ARGM-NEG

You  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
also  >ARGM-DIS
face*  
the  
ire  <ARG1

most  
people  
there  
.  

They  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be*  
imprisoned*  
or  
executed*  

Yes  >ARGM-DIS
,  
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
an

for

Try*

it  >>ARG1
s*  
a  
ammazing  <ARG2
and  
is*  
by  
the  
beach  <ARG2
.  

People  >>ARG1
are*  
open  
minded*  
thr  <ARGM-LOC
since  
the  
place  >>ARG1
is*  
frequented*  
by  
Firangs  <ARG0

I  >ARG0
have*  
a

Cockatiels  >ARG0

eggs  <ARG1
and  
holding*  
it  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-LOC

a

If

see*  >ARGM-ADV
a  
dark  
spot  <ARG1
in

that  >ARG1

!?!?!  
:(  

Different  
...  
one  >ARG1
was*  
in  
the  
jungle  <ARG2
,  
the  
other  >ARG1
is*  
in  
the  
high  
mountain  
deserts  <ARG2
.  

Alike  
...  
both  >>ARG1
were*  
fought*  
for  
securities  
reasons  <ARGM-PRP
by  
the  
US  <ARG0
(  
no  
matter  <ARGM-ADV
what  >ARG1
the  
liberal  
revisionist  
historians  >ARG0
tell*  
you  <ARG2
)  
.  

What  >ARG2
is*  
your  
cat  
s  
name  <ARG1
and  
why  >>ARGM-CAU
did*  
you  >ARG0
name*  
him  <ARG1
/  
her  
that  <ARG2
?  

If  
you  >ARG0
HAVE*  
a  
cat  <ARG1
of  <ARGM-ADV
course  
.  

My  
cat  
s  
name  >ARG1
is*  
Twinky  <ARG2
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG1
was*  
a  
tiny  
little  
kitten  >ARGM-TMP
she  >ARG0
looked*  
like  
those  
twinky  
snack  
cakes  <ARG1
.  

She  >ARG1
is*  
a  
creme  
tabby  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG0
've*  
had*  
her  <ARG1
for  
over  
2  
years  <ARGM-TMP
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >>ARG1
have*  
a  
siamese  
lynx  >C-ARG1
name*  
Star  <ARG2
we  >ARG0
called*  
her  <ARG1
that  <ARG2
because  
she  >ARG0
has*  
a  
star  
pattern  <ARG1
on  
her  
face  <ARGM-LOC
.  

And  
she  >ARG1
is*  
the  
STAR  <ARG2
of  
the  
family  
.  

I  >ARG0
love*  
her  <ARG1
.  
:)  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
Norwegian  
Forest  
Cat  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
is*  
named*  
Achilles  <ARG2
bc  
as  
a  
kitten  >ARGM-PRD
he  >ARG0
always  >ARGM-TMP
attacked*  
your  
feet  <ARG1
when  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
walked*  
by  <ARGM-DIR
!  

My  
cat  >>ARG1
s*  
Called*  
Frank  <ARG2
because  
the  
year  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
got*  
him  <ARG1
was*  
the  
year  >ARGM-TMP
Frank  >ARG1
Sinatra  
died*  

He  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
had*  
bright  
blue  
eyes  <ARG1
like  
Frank  >ARG0
Sinatra  
did*  
:)  

what  >>ARG2
does*  
it  >ARG0
mean*  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
a  
veiled  
chameleon  
egg  >>ARG1
is*  
soft*  
?  

my  
female  
chameleon  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
laid*  
eggs  <ARG1
yesterday  <ARGM-TMP
and  
today  >>ARGM-TMP
some  >>ARG1
of  
the  
eggs  
are*  
soft*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
i  >ARG0
mean*  >ARGM-TMP
soft  <ARG2
i  >ARG0
mean*  
like  <ARGM-DIS
not  
like  
ordinary  
chameleon  
eggs  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG1
are*  
probably  <ARGM-ADV
infertile  <ARG2
.  

If  
there  
is*  >ARGM-ADV
no  
male  <ARG1
they  >ARG1
are*  
probably  <ARGM-ADV
infertile  <ARG2
!  

If  
you  >>ARG0
take*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
flash  
light  <ARG1
and  
shine*  
it  <ARG1
through  
the  
eggs  <ARGM-DIR
and  
you  >ARG0
see*  
nothing  <ARG1
throw*  
them  <ARG1
away  <C-V
!  

If  
you  
do*  >ARGM-ADV
not  
they  >>ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
start*  
to  
rot*  
!  

If  
she  >ARG0
has*  >>ARGM-ADV
no  
male  >ARG0
to  
fertilize*  
the  
eggs  <ARG1
,  
the  
eggs  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
aways  >ARGM-ADV
be*  
infertile  <ARG2
.  

if  
you  >>ARG0
do*  
have*  >>ARGM-ADV
a  
male  <ARG1
but  
they  >>ARG1
are*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
in  
the  
same  
cage  <ARG2
or  
breeding*  
but  
you  >ARG0
touch*  
him  <ARG1
then  
her  
she  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
smell*  
his  
sent  <ARG1
and  
probably  >ARGM-ADV
lay*  
eggs  <ARG1
.  

Hope*  
she  >>ARG0
stops*  
laying*  
eggs  <ARG1
because  
she  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
get*  
really  <ARG2
skinny  <ARG2
!  

If  
she  >ARG0
continues*  
!  

Hope*  
this  >ARG0
helps*

We  >ARG0

geiven

only  >ARGM-ADV

We  >ARG0

Take*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
ferry  >ARG1
ride*  
!!!  

It  >ARG1
's*  
an  
amazing  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
!  

Is*  
it  <ARG1
better*  
to  
book*  
a  
cruise  <ARG1
online  <ARGM-MNR
or  
by  
a  
travel  
agent  
?  

First  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
go*  
on  
A  
cruise  <ARG1
any  
and  
all  
info  >>ARG1
is*  
appreciated*  

Personally  >>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
find*  
a  
travel  
agent  >ARG1
to  
be*  
of  
value  <ARG2
to  
me  
as  
I  >>ARG0
am*  
willing*  
to  
put*  
in  
the  
time  <ARG1
doing*  >ARGM-LVB
research*  
on  
the  
internet  <ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >>ARG0
have*  
not  >>ARGM-NEG
had*  >ARGM-LVB
good  >ARGM-ADJ
experience*  
with  
travel  
agents  <ARG1
.  

They  >>ARG0
do*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
seem*  
to  
know*  
anything  <ARG1
but  
the  
hype  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG2
are*  
told*  
and  
the  
packages  >>ARG2
they  >ARG0
have*  
available*  
to  
them  <ARG1
.  

The  
one  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
actually  >ARGM-ADV
booked*  
through  
a  
travel  
agent  <ARGM-MNR
I  >>ARG0
did*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
get*  
all  <ARG1
of  
the  
amenities  >>ARG3
I  >>ARG0
had*  
paid*  
for  <C-ARG3
.  

The  
few  
times  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
have*  
consulted*  
with  
a  
travel  
agent  <ARG1
I  >>ARG0
was*  
able*  
to  
find*  
the  
same  <ARG1
for  
less  <ARGM-ADV
on  
my  
own  <ARGM-MNR
,  
and  
more  
options  <C-ARG1
than  
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
were*  
selling*  
.  

So  >>ARGM-DIS
now  >>ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
do*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
bother*  
with  
them  <ARG1
at  
all  <ARGM-EXT
.  

best  >ARG1
is*  
using*  
an  
online  
travel  
agent  <ARG1

My  
Hamster  >ARG0
escaped*  
....  
NEED*  
HELP*  
NOW  <<ARGM-TMP
!?  

okay  >ARGM-DIS
....  
I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
dog  <ARG1
and  
my  
mother  >>ARG1
is*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
really  >ARGM-EXT
terrified*  
of  
hamsters  <ARG0
.  

Well  >>ARGM-DIS
last  
night  >>ARGM-TMP
while  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
sleeping*  >ARGM-TMP
,  
my  
hamster  >ARG0
escaped*  
from  
his  
cage  <ARG1
.  

He  >ARG1
is*  
in  
my  
room  <ARG2
,  
but  
there  
are*  
so  
many  
things  <ARG1
inside  
there  
,  
I  >>ARG0
du*  
n  >ARGM-NEG
no*  
what  >ARG1
to  
do*  
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
lots  <ARG1
of  
containers  
in  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Anybody  >ARG0
give*  
me  <ARG2
ideas  <ARG1
like  
a  
trap  
or  
something  
?  

Find*  
him  <ARG1
before  
he  >ARG0
finds*  
the  
dog  
food  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
kidding*  
,  
I  >ARG0
once  >ARGM-TMP
lost*  
a  
hamster  <ARG1
in  
my  
house  <ARGM-LOC
3  
months  
later  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
walk*  
down  <ARG2
in  
the  
basement  <ARG2
and  
it  >>ARG1
was*  
as  >ARGM-CXN
big*  
as  
a  
rat  <C-ARGM-CXN
.  

It  >>ARG0
had*  
been*  
eating*  
dog  
food  <ARG1
the  
whole  
time  <ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >>ARG0
was*  
huge*  
and  
scared*  
the  
crap  <ARG3
out  
of  
me  <ARG1
.  

Make*  
sure*  
he  >>ARG1
is*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
trapped*  
somewhere  <ARG2
&  
put*  
a  
bowl  <ARG1
of  
food  
out  <ARG2
.  

He  >>ARG0
will  >>ARGM-MOD
come*  
and  
eat*  

Start*  
cleaning*  
and  
start*  
looking*  
.  

can  >ARGM-MOD
i  >ARG0
have*  
some  
indoor  
pet  
ideas  <ARG1
please  <ARGM-DIS
!!!!!!!!!!!!!?  

i  >ARG0
want*  
a  
small  
indoor  
pet  >>ARG1
that  >>R-ARG1
my  
mother  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
let*  
me  >ARG0
have*  
please  >ARGM-DIS
help*  

i  >ARG0
want*  
something  <ARG1
cheap  
east  
to  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  <ARG1
and  
something  >ARG1
to  
hopefully  >ARGM-ADV
fit*  
in  
my  
room  <ARGM-LOC

no  
pet  >>ARG1
is*  
really  >ARGM-EXT
easy*  
to  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  <ARG1
.  

they  >ARG0
all  
need*  
love*  
and  
attn  
,  
food  
,  
proper  
surroundings  
etc  
.  

the  
easiest  
thing  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
be*  
a  
fish  <ARG2
-  
but  
u  >>ARG0
need*  
to  
clean*  
the  
tank  <ARG1
weekly  <ARGM-TMP
,  
feed*  
it  <ARG2
the  
right  
amt  <ARGM-EXT
,  
etc  <ARGM-ADV
etc  <ARGM-ADV
x  

Having*  >>ARG1
a  
pet  <ARG1
is*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
easy*  
.  

You  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
treat*  
all  
pets  <ARG1
like  
children  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG0
require*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
of  
attention*  
or  
they  >>ARG0
get*  
fussy  <ARG2
and  
tear*  
stuff  <ARG1
up  <C-V
.  

If  
you  >ARG0
want*  >ARGM-ADV
easy  <ARG1
then  >ARGM-ADV
go*  
with  
a  
gold  
fish  <ARG1
or  
hamster  
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
go*  
with  
a  
small  
rodent  <ARG1
such  
as  
a  
mouse  
,  
rat  
,  
hamster  
or  
gerbil  
if  
you  >ARG0
want*  
something  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0
can  >>ARGM-MOD
handle*  
and  
hold*  
.  

Fish  >ARG1
are*  
probably  <ARGM-ADV
the  
easiest  >>ARG1
to  
take*  >ARGM-LVB
care*  
of  <C-ARG1
though  <<ARGM-DIS
.  

french  
male  
sensuality  
?  

I  >>ARG0
ve*  
been*  
dating*  
a  
man  <ARG1
from  
brittany  
france  
for  
a  
couple  <ARGM-TMP
of  
months  
now  <ARGM-TMP
.  

He  >>ARG1
's*  
been*  
away  <ARG2
for  
a  
week  <ARGM-TMP
and  
I  >>ARG0
was*  
thinking*  
of  
waiting*  
for  
him  <ARG2
in  
his  
apartment  <ARGM-LOC
wearing*  
only  <ARGM-ADV
his  
dress  
shirt  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
s*  
still  <ARGM-TMP
a  
fairly  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
relationship*  
and  
we  >>ARG0
have*  
nt  >>ARGM-NEG
had*  >ARGM-LVB
sex*  
yet  <ARGM-TMP
so  >ARGM-ADV
it  >ARG1
s*  
kind  <ARGM-ADV
of  
a  
big  >ARGM-ADJ
deal*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
just  >>ARGM-ADV
do*  
nt  >ARGM-NEG
want*  
to  
freak*  
him  <ARG1
out  <C-V
or  
make*  
him  >>ARG1
feel*  
uncomfortable*  
.  

Is*  
it  <ARG1
ok  <ARG2
for  
a  
woman  >>ARG0
in  
french  
culture  >>ARGM-LOC
to  
make*  >ARGM-LVB
the  
first  >ARGM-TMP
move*  
?  

What  
do*  
french  
men  >ARG0
find*  
sexy  <ARG1

French  
women  >ARG1
are*  
the  
ones  >ARG0
to  
say*  
yes  <ARG1
,  
the  
way*  >>ARG1
we  >ARG0
say*  
it  <ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
usually  <ARGM-ADV
as  
straigthforward  <ARG2
as  
you  >ARG0
propose*  
to  
do*  
.  

Why  >ARGM-CAU
not  >ARGM-NEG
wait*  
for  
him  <ARG2
in  
a  
sexy  
dress  <ARGM-ADV
with  
lunch  <ARGM-ADV
or  
dinner  
,  
or  
a  
light  
snack  
at  
his  
house  <ARGM-LOC
.  

And  
you  >ARG0
take*  
it  <ARG1
up  <ARGM-PRD
from  
there  <ARG2
.  

Just  >ARGM-ADV
make*  
sure*  
that  
it  >ARG1
is*  
a  
light  
meal  <ARG2
with  
little  
alcohol

however  >>ARGM-ADV
the

so  >ARGM-CXN
close*  
together  <ARG2
that  
it  >ARG0
feels*

Chuck  >>ARG1
and  
Gretchen  
were*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
positive*  
,  
and  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
Alan  >>ARG0
's  
refused*  >>ARGM-TMP
to  
work*  
on  
my  
bike  <ARG1
,  
Chuck  >>ARG0
came*  
right  
out  <ARGM-DIR
and  
saw*  
the  
problem  <ARG1
and  
did*  
what  >ARG1
Alan  
's  
mechanic  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
do*  
.  

He  >ARG0
worked*  
on  
it  <ARG1
right  
on  
the  
back  <ARGM-LOC
of  
my  
car  
.  

I  >>ARG1
am*  
extremely  >ARGM-ADV
pleased*  

Quick  
and  
Cheap  

Walked*  
in  <ARG2
and  
was*  
out  
ta  
there  <ARG2
in  
10  
mins  <ARGM-TMP
with  
a  
really  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
deal*  
i  >ARG0
thought*  
i  >>ARG0
was*  
going*  
to  
be*  
paying*  
a  
lot  <ARG1
because  
i  >ARG0
had*  
a  
DUI  <ARG1
but  
with  
my  
DUI  >>ARGM-ADV
and  
Sr  
-  
22  
they  >>ARG0
were*  
able*  
to  
get*  
me  <ARG4
the  
best  >ARGM-ADJ
deal*  
out  
there  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
a  
service  
office  <ARG2

This  >>ARG0
is*  
a  
delivery  
office  <ARG2
only  
and  
does*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
take*  
walk  
ins  <ARG1
but  
they  >>ARG0
do*  
have*  
a  
blue  
box  <ARG1
out  
front  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Glad  
I  >ARG0
called*  
before  
I  >ARG1
arrived*  
with  
my  
box  >ARG1
to  
ship*  
.  

Thought*  
adding*  >>ARG3
a  
comment*  
would  >ARGM-MOD
save*  
someone  <ARG2
the  
hassle*  
with  
a  
useless  >ARGM-ADJ
trip*  
there  <ARG1
.  

the  
food  >ARG1
is*  
mediocre  <ARG2
at  
best  <ARGM-ADV
.  

the  
waitress  >>ARG0
took*  
my  
name  <ARG1
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
called*  
me  <ARG1
that  <ARG2
all  
night  <ARGM-TMP
.  

not  
sure  
how  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
feel*  
about  
that  
one  <ARG2
.  

it  >ARG1
's*  
passable  <ARG2
as  
a  
pub  <ARGM-ADV
,  
but  
the  
pizza  >>ARG1
is*  
not  >ARGM-NEG
that  >ARGM-EXT
great*  
.  

if  
you  >ARG0
want*  >ARGM-ADV
good  
pizza  <ARG1
,  
go*  
to  
famoso  <ARG4
.  

seriously  
.  

Anyone  >ARG0
else  
find*  
it  <ARG1
a  
little  
suspicious  <ARG1
that  
there  
are*  
not  
only  <ARGM-ADV
20  
reviews*  
for  
this  
dentist  <ARG1
(  
a  
HUGE  
number  
compared  
to  
the  
others  
in  
the  
area  
)  
,  
but  
that  
they  >ARG0
all  
have*  
the  
same  
unique  
grammar  
structure  <ARG1
?  

And  >ARGM-DIS
they  >>ARG1
seem*  
to  
be*  
posted*  
at  
fairly  
regular  
intervals  <ARGM-TMP
?  

Best  
YET  
!  

We  >ARG0
go*  
to  
Japaneiro  <ARG4
's  
all  
the  
time  <ARGM-TMP
and  
we  >>ARG1
have*  
NEVER  >>ARGM-NEG
been*  
disappointed*  
!  

Wait  
staff  >>ARG0
is*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
ready*  
to  
help*  
if  
you  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
decide*  
(  
which  >ARG1
happens*  
every  
time  <ARGM-TMP
for  
me  <ARG2
d  
/  
t  
the  
huge  
menu  <ARGM-CAU

Harlan  >ARG0
provides*  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
.  

He  >>ARG0
is*  
very  >ARGM-EXT
knowledgeable*  
and  
took*  
the  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
explain*  
the  
repairs*  
to  
me  <<ARG2
.  

The  
work*  >>ARG1
on  
my  
car  <ARG1
was*  
done*  
quickly  <ARGM-MNR
and  
I  >ARG0
felt*  
I  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
trust*  
his  >ARG0
work*  
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
nothing  <ARG1
but  
fantastic  
things  >ARG1
to  
say*  
.  

I  >ARG0
highly  >ARGM-EXT
recommend*  
his  
shop  <ARG1
.  

Best  
in  
Memphis  

This  
shop  >ARG1
is*  
by  
far  <ARGM-EXT
the  
best  >>ARG2
I  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
to  <C-ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
have*  
a  
Saab  >>ARGM-LOC
...  
which  >>R-ARGM-LOC
everything  >>ARG1
is*  
expensive*  
on  <C-ARGM-LOC
and  
they  >>ARG1
have*  
been*  
extrememly  >ARGM-ADV
fair*  
and  
price*  
a  
lot  
lower  
than  
any  
other  
shop  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
called*  
.  

They  >ARG1
are*  
the  
only  
place  >ARG3
I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
take*  
my  
car  <ARG1
peiod  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Took*  
a  
laptop  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
for  
a  
video  
cable  >>ARG1
to  
be*  
replaced*  
.  

Everything  >ARG1
except  
the  
display  
worked*  
fine  <ARGM-MNR
before  
I  >ARG0
took*  
it  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
.  

The  
video  
cable  >>ARG1
was*  
replaced*  
and  
suddenly  >ARGM-TMP
the  
motherboard  >ARG1
was*  
dead  <ARG2
.  

Phone  >ARGM-MNR
calls*  >>ARG1
were*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
returned*  
when  >ARGM-TMP
promised*  
and  
the  
botched*  >ARGM-PRD
repair*  >ARG0
took*  
a  
week  
longer  <ARG1
than  
promised*  
.  

We  >>ARG1
have*  
stayed*  
at  
Tanglewood  <ARG3
for  
many  
years  <ARGM-TMP
now  
.  

We  >ARG0
go*  
over  <ARGM-TMP
about  
5  
times  <ARGM-TMP
a  
year  
.  

We  >>ARG0
have*  
never  >ARGM-NEG
had*  
a  
problem  <ARG1
with  
the  
cabins  
.  

They  >>ARG0
are*  
always  >ARGM-TMP
so  >ARGM-EXT
helpful*  
.  

The  
cabins  >>ARG1
have*  
always  >>ARGM-TMP
been*  
clean*  
.  

Helen  >ARG1
is*  
a  
wonderful  
place  >ARG3
to  
take*  
you  
family  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
recommend*  
these  
cabins  <ARG1
!  

Ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
say*  
enough  <ARG1

I  >>ARG1
used*  
to  
tan*  
down  
the  
street  <ARGM-LOC
before  
I  >>ARG1
was*  
referred*  
to  
this  
place  <ARG2
by  
one  <ARG0
of  
my  
friends  
.  

WOW  
!  

I  >>ARG0
did*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know*  
what  >>ARG1
I  >>ARG0
was*  
missing*  
.  

The  
lowest  
bed  >>ARG1
here  
is*  
better*  
than  
my  
last  
salon  
s  
highest  
level  <ARGM-CXN
.  

Salon  >>ARG1
is*  
clean*  
and  
girls  >>ARG1
are*  
nice*  
.  

Great  
People  
and  
even  
better  >ARGM-ADJ
service*  
!  

Best  
to  
deal*  
with  <ARG1
!  

In  
a  
few  
words  >>ARGM-ADV
...  
I  >>ARG1
'm*  
pleasantly  >ARGM-MNR
surprised*  
that  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
still  >ARGM-TMP
find*  
"  
old  
school  >ARGM-ADJ
"  
service*  
out  
there  <<ARGM-LOC
where  >ARGM-LOC
company  >ARG0
care*  
more  <ARGM-EXT
about  
good  
name  <ARG1
and  
customers  
than  
their  
pockets  <C-ARGM-EXT
...  

Highly  
recommended  
people  
/  
business  
.  

Thanks*  
Josh  <ARGM-DIS

Dentist  >ARG1

can  >ARGM-MOD
trust*  

If  
possible  >ARGM-ADV
I  >ARG0
try*  
the  
services*  
on  
myself  <<ARGM-GOL
before  
I  >ARG0
bring*  
in  <ARG3
my  
son  <ARG1
.  

Drs.  >ARG0
Ali  
work*  
wonders*  
.  

Neither  
me  >>ARG0
nor  
my  
son  
have*  
n't  >ARGM-NEG
had*  
a  
single  
cavity  <ARG1
since  
we  >ARG0
started*  
dental  >ARGM-ADJ
care*  
there  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

The  
team  
focus  >ARG1
is*  
prevention*  
and  
education*  
.  

That  >ARG0
alone  
makes*  
them  >ARG1
unique*  
.  

This  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
your  
usual  
cheap  
hotdog  
place  <ARG2
.  

They  >ARG0
offer*  
a  
large  
variety  <ARG1
of  
quality  
hotdogs  
and  
hamburgers  
They  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
offer*  
veggie  
dogs  <ARG1
.  

The  
fries  >ARG1
are*  
of  
good  
quality  <ARG2
,  
the  
staff  >>ARG1
is*  
friendly*  
.  

The  
atmosphere  >ARG1
is*  
your  
typical  
indie  
outfit  <ARG2
with  
old  
movie  
posters  <ARGM-ADV
and  
memorabilia  
from  
the  
70's  
and  
80's  
.  

Over  >ARGM-EXT
charged*  
.  

I  >>ARG0
used*  
my  
card  <ARG1
to  
purchase*  
a  
meal  <ARG1
on  
the  
menu  
and  
the  
total  >ARG1
on  
my  
receipt  
was*  
$  <ARG2
8.95  
but  
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >>ARG0
went*  >>ARGM-TMP
on  
line  <ARG4
to  
check*  
my  >ARG0
transaction*  
it  >ARG0
show*  
$  <ARG1
10.74  
.  

There  
is*  
something  <ARG1
wrong  
or  
maybe  >>ARGM-ADV
the  
individual  >>ARG0
made*  >ARGM-LVB
a  
mistake*  
but  
to  
me  >ARGM-ADV
that  >ARG1
is*  
not  <ARGM-NEG
integrity  <ARG2

Elmira  >ARGM-DIS
