Let  V01
me  >ARG0
join  V04
the  
chorus  V01
of  
annoyance  <ARG1
over  
Google  
's  
new  
toolbar  >>>ARG0

noted  V01

commit  V02

and  
makes  V10
up  
a  
few  
new  
ones  <ARG1

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
fond  V01
of

However  >ARGM-ADV
,  
this

really  
bad

On  
the  
other  
hand  >>ARGM-ADV

it  >>ARG1
looks  V02
pretty  >ARGM-ADV

Iran  >ARG0
says  V01
it  >>>ARG0

creating  V01

n't  >ARGM-NEG

One  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD

the  
Iranian  
Government  <ARG2
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
there  
is  V02
no  >ARGM-NEG
proof  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
read  V01
an  
Article  >ARG0
in  
Time  
magazine  
accusing  V01
the  
Iranian  
Government  >>>ARG0
of  
being  V01
willing  V02
to  
start  V01
a  
nuclear  >ARGM-ADJ
war  V01
and  
I  >ARG0
sympathise  V01
with  
the  
Article  <ARG1
.  

They  >>>ARG0
are  V03
certainly  >>ARGM-ADV
being  V01
nasty  V01
to  
the  
United  
Nations  
Security  
Council  <ARG2
in  
connection  V01
with  
the  
anti-proliferation  
treaty  <ARG2
.  

The  
President  >>ARG0
has  V01
also  >ARGM-DIS
said  V01
he  >>ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V02
to  
see  V01
Israel  >ARG1
wiped  V01
off  
the  
map  <ARG2
which  >>ARG1
he  >>ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
begin  V02
to  
try  V01
without  
nuclear  
weapons  <ARGM-MNR
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
he  >>ARG0
has  V01
insisted  V01
that  
he  >ARG0
wants  V01
nuclear  
power  <ARG1
for  
peaceful  
purposes  <ARGM-PRP
.  

Many  
people  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
use  V01
diplomacy  <ARG1
with  
Iran  <ARGM-GOL
rather  
than  
military  
pressure  <ARGM-ADV
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
will  >ARGM-MOD
diplomacy  >ARG1
work  V09
?  

And  >ARGM-DIS
can  >ARGM-MOD
anyone  >ARG0
use  V01
military  
pressure  <ARG1
without  
proof  V01
?  

One  
reader  >ARG0
pointed  V02
out  
that  
the  
President  >ARG0
watched  V01
the  
Americans  <ARG1
in  
the  
embassy  
when  >ARGM-TMP
they  >ARG0
took  V03
them  
hostage  <ARG2
.  

He  >>ARG0
has  V01
denied  V01
this  <ARG1
.  

We  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  
have  V02
to  
believe  V01
him  <ARG1
.  

But  >ARGM-DIS
we  >ARG0
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
prove  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

It  
does  V01
seem  V01
that  
Iranians  >>>ARG0
frequently  >>>ARGM-TMP
make  VLV
statements  V01
and  
then  >ARGM-TMP
hide  V01
behind  
lack  V01
of  
proof  V01

I  >>ARG0
had  V02
to  
go  V02
to  
the

this  
report  V01

It  
's  V01
symptomatic  V01
,  
I  >ARG0
suppose  V01
,  
of

It  >>ARG1
's  V01
just  >ARGM-ADV
disappointing  V01

Most  
troubling  >ARG1
,  
however  >ARGM-DIS
,  
is  V01
the  
fact  <ARG2
that  
the

be  V03
taken  VLV
to  
end  V01
the  
ethnic  
violence  <ARG1
in  
Darfur  
within  
48  
hours  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Two  
weeks  
later  
,  
and  
the  
violence  >ARG1
continues  V01
.  

The  
African  
Union  >>>ARG0
is  V01
clearly  <ARGM-ADV
not  <ARGM-NEG
up  
to  
the  
task  V01
of  
keeping  V02
the  
peace  V01
,  
pledging  V01
300  
troops  <ARG1
to  
an  
area  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
15,000  <ARG1
,  
according  
to  
analysts  <ARGM-ADV
.  

And  >>ARGM-DIS
international  
donors  >>ARG0
have  V01
given  V01
only  
half  <ARG1
of  
the  
relief  >ARG1
aid  V01
that  >R-ARG1
Darfur  >ARG0
needs  V01
,  
according  
to  
the  
local  
UN  
officials  <<<ARGM-ADV
.  

So  >ARGM-DIS
hear  >ARG2
we  >ARG1
are  V01
,  
two  
weeks  
later  <ARGM-TMP
,  
after  
that  
dazzling  >ARGM-MNR
PR  >ARGM-PRP
display  V01
two  
weeks  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
by  
Powell  <ARG0
and  
Annan  
,  
and  
the  
situation  >>ARG1
on  
the  
ground  
in  
Darfur  
appears  V02
basically  >ARGM-ADV
unchanged  V01
.  

Warren  >>ARG0
Buffett  
is  V03
giving  V02
away  
85  
%  <ARG1
of  
his  
wealth  
,  
mostly  
to  
the  
Bill  
and  
Melinda  
Gates  
Foundation  <ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
move  V01
that  >R-ARG0
really  >ARGM-EXT
worries  V01
me  <ARG1
;  
Buffett  >ARG0
's  
usual  >ARGM-ADJ
justification  V01
for  
keeping  V01
most  <ARG1
of  
his  
money  
was  V01
that  
he  >>ARG0
was  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
compounding  V01
the  
value  <ARG1
of  
his  
fortune  
at  
a  
pretty  
high  
rate  <ARGM-MNR
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
any  
gifts  >ARG1
now  
would  >ARGM-MOD
mean  V01
significantly  
less  
money  <ARG2
for  
the  
foundation  
later  
.  

It  >>ARG1
's  V01
a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
hard  V02
to  
parse  V01
,  
but  
at  
this  
point  >>ARGM-TMP
his  >ARG0
ostensible  >ARGM-ADJ
view  V02
is  V01
that  
the  
Gateses  >ARG1
are  V01
very  
good  
money  
-  
redistributors  <ARG2
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
wants  V01
them  >ARG0
to  
have  V03
the  
money  <ARG1
as  
soon  <ARGM-TMP
as  
possible  
.  

Which  >ARG1
essentially  >ARGM-ADV
sounds  V01
like  
he  >>ARG1
's  V01
worried  V01
that  
Bill  >>>ARG1
or  
Melinda  
are  V03
going  V04
to  
die  V01
soon  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
assume  V02
his  
actual  
reason  >ARG1
is  V01
that  
he  >>ARG1
's  V01
worried  V01
that  
Berkshire  
Hathaway  >ARG1
just  >ARGM-DIS
ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
grow  V01
quickly  
enough  <ARGM-TMP
to  
justify  V01
his  
usual  
charity  
policy  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure  V02
how  >ARGM-MNR
the  
market  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
react  V01
.  

It  >>ARG0
does  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
change  V01
the  
company  
's  
intrinsic  
worth  <ARG1
,  
and  
as  
the  
article  >ARG0
notes  V01
,  
the  
company  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
added  V02
to  
a  
major  
index  <ARG2
once  
the  
shares  V01
get  V03
more  <ARG2
liquid  <ARG2
.  

On  
the  
other  
hand  >ARGM-ADV
,  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
essentially  <ARGM-ADV
a  
statement  V01
that  
the  
company  >ARG1
is  V01
overpriced  <ARG2
from  
the  
guy  >>>ARG1
who  >>>R-ARG1
knows  V01
it  <ARG1
best  <ARGM-EXT
--  
and  
happens  V02
to  
be  V01
the  
best  
investor  <ARG2
of  
the  
last  
century  
.  

em  >ARGM-DIS
...  
no  >ARGM-DIS
...  
the  
Gates  
foundation  >ARG0
mainly  >ARGM-ADV
invests  V01
in  
medical  >ARG1
research  V01
and  
education  V01
,  
that  >ARG1
means  V01
donating  V01
now  <ARGM-TMP
adds  V02
a  
tremendous  
value  <ARG1
compared  
to  
donating  V01
in  
ten  
years  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Because  
the  
10.000.000  
people  >>ARG1
dying  V01
from  
malaria  <ARGM-CAU
will  >ARGM-MOD
otherwise  >ARGM-ADV
be  V01
dead  <ARG2
.  

i.e  
.  

He  >>ARG0
's  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
giving  V02
85  
%  <ARG1
away  <C-V
,  
he  >>ARG0
's  V03
giving  V01
a  
number  >>ARG1
of  
shares  V01
each  
year  <<ARGM-TMP
that  >R-ARG1
decrease  V01
in  
number  <ARGM-MNR
at  
the  
rate  <ARG2
of  
5  
%  
a  
year  
(  
until  
gone  <ARGM-TMP
?  
)  
.  

He  >ARG0
mentions  V01
his  
wife  >ARG1
's  
death  V01
having  VLV
an  
effect  V01
on  
him  <ARG1
.  

It  
sounds  V01
pretty  >ARGM-EXT
rational  V02
that  
he  >>ARG0
's  V03
saying  V01
that  
Bill  >ARG1
and  
Melinda  
are  V01
at  
a  
prime  
spot  <ARG2
,  
so  >>ARGM-ADV
starting  V01
the  
money  
hose  <ARG1
now  <ARGM-TMP
is  V01
a  
good  
idea  <ARG2
,  
but  
Buffet  >>ARG0
is  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
keeping  V01
most  <ARG1
of  
his  >ARG0
donation  V01
inside  
of  
Berkshire  >ARGM-LOC
where  >R-ARGM-LOC
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
compound  V01
.  

Bill  >ARG0

an

on

the  
UN  
,  
even  
the  
leftist  
countries

are  V03
basically  >ARGM-ADV
accepting  V01
terrorist

as  
legitimate

of  
a

On

Syria

will  >ARGM-MOD
participate  V01
in  
the  
scheduled  >ARGM-PRD
upcoming  >ARGM-TMP
Parliamentary  >ARG2
elections  V01
.  

To  
the  
north  >ARGM-LOC
in  
Lebanon  >ARGM-LOC
,  
there  
is  V02
serious  >ARGM-MNR
debate  V01
within  
Hezbollah  <ARG0
about  
entering  V01
the  
Lebanese  >ARG0

in  
light  <<ARGM-ADV

the  
conditions  >ARG1
set  V02
forth  <ARGM-ADV
in  
UNSC  
Resolution  >>ARG1
1559  
,  
which  >>R-ARG1
has  V01
already  >ARGM-TMP
begun  V01
.  

UN  
Secretary

General  
Kofi  >>ARG0

indicated  V01
it  >ARG1
is  V01
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
"  
recognize  V02
Hezbollah  <ARG1
"  
after  
easily  >>ARGM-ADV
being  V03
duped  V01
by  
"  
the  
message  <ARG0
on  
the  
placards  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
using  V01
"  
.  

This  
acceptance  V01
of  
blatantly  
terrorist  
groups  <ARG1
as  
legitimate  >ARGM-ADJ
freedom  >ARG1
movements  V07
is  V01
a  
cancerous  
tumor  <ARG2
on  
the  
United  
Nations  
and  
the  
media  
.  

Over  
three  
years  
after  
9-11  >>>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
United  
Nations  >>>ARG0
,  
despite  
their  >ARG0
attempts  V01
to  
project  V01
strength  <ARG1
in  
fighting  V01
terrorism  <ARG1
,  
still  >ARGM-TMP
can  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
properly  >ARGM-MNR
define  V01
the  
word  <ARG1
"  
terrorist  
"  
,  
waffling  V01
over  
the  
issue  V02
of  
whether  
the  
murder  V01
of  
innocent  
civilians  <ARG1
are  V01
terrorist  
acts  <ARG2
.  

The  
media  >ARG0
routinely  >ARGM-TMP
obscures  V01
the  
lines  <ARG1
between  
terrorism  
and  
legitimate  >ARGM-ADJ
resistance  V01
,  
as  
the  
recent  
article  >ARG0
by  
Daniel  
Okrent  
of  
The  
New  
York  
Times  
demonstrates  V01
.  

...  

The  
decision  V01
to  
sidestep  V01
the  
obvious  <ARG1
to  
satisfy  V01
the  
need  V01
to  
avoid  V01
confrontation  V01
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
bring  V01
peace  V01
,  
but  
only  >ARGM-ADV
delays  V01
the  
eventual  >ARGM-TMP
conflict  V01
as  
the  
predators  >ARG0
of  
Hamas  
and  
Hezbollah  
exploit  V01
the  
inherent  
weakness  <ARG1
of  
the  
internationals  
and  
the  
media  
.  

I  >>>ARG0
've  V01
been  V03
fuming  V01
over  
this  
fact  <ARG1
for  
a  
few  
weeks  <ARGM-TMP
now  <ARGM-TMP
,  
ever  
since  
some  
organizations  >ARG0
and  
governments  
suggested  V01
we  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
accept  V01
the  
fact  <ARG1
that  
Hezbollah  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
get  V03
involved  V01
in  
running  V01
Lebanon  <ARG1
.  

Wtf  >ARG2
is  V01
this  <ARG1
?  

This  >>>ARG1
is  V01
a  
terrorist  
organization  <ARG2
plain  V01
and  
simple  V02
.  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
organization  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
bombed  V01
our  
Marine  
barracks  <ARG1
in  
1983  <ARGM-TMP
,  
took  V03
Americans  
hostage  <ARG2
throughout  
the  
80's  <ARGM-TMP
and  
now  >>ARGM-TMP
they  
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
considered  V01
a  
legitimate  
organization  <ARG1
?  

This  >ARG1
is  V01
just  
another  
reason  <ARG2
to  
never  >ARGM-NEG
trust  V02
the  
MSM  <ARG1
,  
and  
certainly  
not  
the  
Europeans  
.  

The  
Iraqi  
Islamic  
Party  >>>ARG1
lead  V02
by  
Muhsin  <ARG0
Abdul  
Hamid  
,  
has  V01
been  V01
among  
the  
few  
Sunni  
Muslim  
groups  <ARG2
willing  
to  
cooperate  V01
(  
even  
if  
rather  
lukewarmly  
)  
with  
the  
Americans  <ARG1
.  

It  >>>ARG1
is  V03
now  >ARGM-TMP
threatening  V01
to  
pull  V02
out  
of  
the  
Allawi  
caretaker  
government  <ARG2
.  

The  
IIP  >>>ARG1
had  V01
also  >ARGM-ADV
been  V01
the  
main  
force  >ARG0
urging  V01
Sunni  
Arabs  >ARG0
to  
participate  V01
in  
the  
elections  V01
scheduled  V01
for  
January  <ARG3
,  
and  
had  V01
been  V03
opposed  V01
in  
this  
stance  V11
by  
the  
Association  <<ARG0
of  
Muslim  
Scholars  
.  

That  
the  
Iraqi  
Islamic  
Party  >>ARG0
is  V03
now  >ARGM-TMP
contemplating  V01
leaving  V15
the  
Allawi  <ARG1

raises  V01
the  
question  V01
of  
whether  
a  
mass  >ARGM-ADJ
Sunni  >ARG0
Arab  >ARG0
boycott  V01
of  
the

is  V01
in  
the

thus  >ARGM-ADV
fatally  >ARGM-ADV
weakening  V01
the

Folks  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
if  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
Islamic  >ARGM-ADV
,  
and  
fascist  
,  
it  >ARG1
's  V01
an  
Islamic  
fascist  <ARG2
.  

But  >>>ARGM-DIS
because  
we  >>>ARG1
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
want  V01
to  
sound  V01
hateful  <ARG2
we  >>>ARG0
must  >>>ARGM-MOD
pretend  V01
everyone  >ARG1
's  V01
a  
possible  
suspect  <ARG2
and  
make  V02
airline  >ARGM-MNR
travel  V01
more  >ARGM-CXN
miserable  V01
than  
it  >>ARG1
's  V03
ever  >ARGM-TMP
been  V01
.  

On  
the  
internet  
site  >ARGM-LOC
of  
Monotheism  
and  
Holy  
War  
(  
al  
-  
Tawhid  
wa  
al  
-  
Jihad  
)  
,  
the  
group  >ARG0
allegedly  >ARGM-ADV
declared  V01
,  
"  
We  >ARG0
announce  V01
that  
the  
Tawhid  
and  
Jihad  
Group  >>ARG0
,  
its  
prince  
and  
soldiers  
,  
have  V01
pledged  V01
allegiance  <ARG2
to  
the  
sheikh  <ARG1
of  
the  
mujahideen  
Osama  
bin  
Laden  
.  
"  

This  
pledge  >>ARG1
is  V01
a  
new  >ARGM-TMP
development  V01
.  

Abu  >>>ARG1
Musab  
al  
-  
Zarqawi  
and  
his  
group  
are  V03
said  V01
to  
have  V01
been  V01
bitter  
rivals  <ARG2
of  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
during  
the  
Afghan  
resistance  
days  <ARGM-TMP
.  

One  
witness  >>ARG0
at  
the  
Moutasaddiq  >ARG1
trial  V02
in  
Germany  <ARGM-LOC
alleged  V01
that  
Zarqawi  >>ARG0
had  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
allowed  V01
Monotheism  >ARG0
and  
Holy  
War  
to  
share  V01
resources  <ARG1
with  
al  
-  
Qaeda  <ARG2
in  
the  
early  
zeroes  <ARGM-TMP
of  
the  
21st  
century  
.  

If  
the  
statement  V01
is  V01
true  V01
,  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
worrying  >ARGM-ADJ
sign  V07
that  
even  
the  
divided  
small  
radical  
guerrilla  
groups  >>>ARG1
are  V03
being  V03
"  
picked  V11
up  
"  
by  
al  
-  
Qaeda  <ARG0
.  

This  
consolidation  V01
is  V01
obviously  <ARGM-ADV
a  
result  <ARG2
of  
Bush  >ARG0
's  
aggressive  >ARGM-MNR
invasion  V01
of  
Iraq  <ARG1
and  
of  
the  
botching  V01
of  
the  
aftermath  <ARG1
.  

It  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
setback  <ARG2
for  
the  
war  V01
on  
terror  <ARG2
.  

Al  
-  
Qaeda  >ARG1
in  
Afghanistan  
was  V01
a  
group  <ARG2
of  
only  
a  
few  
hundred  
"  
Afghan  
Arabs  >ARG0
"  
who  >R-ARG0
pledged  V01
personal  
loyalty  <ARG2
to  
Usamah  <ARG1
Bin  
Laden  
.  

It  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
notionally  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V03
expanded  V01
to  
encompass  V01
the  
5,000  
-  
strong  
"  
55th  
Brigade  <ARG1
"  
of  
the  
Taliban  
regime  
,  
though  
this  >ARG1
is  V01
not  <ARGM-NEG
the  
technical  >ARGM-ADJ
definition  V01
.  

Because  
Usamah  >ARG1
is  V01
Saudi  >>ARGM-CAU
,  
my  >ARG0
guess  V01
is  V01
that  
they  >>ARG1
were  V03
especially  >ARGM-EXT
influenced  V01
by  
an  
extremist  
form  <ARG0
of  
the  
Wahhabi  
school  >ARG1
of  
Islam  
that  >R-ARG1
predominates  V01
among  
Saudia  
's  
some  
15  
million  
citizens  <ARG2
.  

In  
1998  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>ARG1
were  V03
joined  V04
by  
Egyptians  <ARG0
from  
the  
al  
-  
Jihad  
al  
-  
Islami  
group  
of  
Ayman  
al  
-  
Zawahiri  
(  
many  >ARG1
of  
these  
were  V01
from  
Upper  
Egypt  <ARG2
,  
especially  
Asyut  
and  
environs  
)  
.  

After  
that  
point  >ARGM-TMP
,  
al  
-  
Qaeda  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
joint  
enterprise  <ARG2
between  
the  
Egyptian  
extremists  
and  
the  
polyglot  
Arabs  >ARG1
around  
Bin  
Laden  
,  
only  
some  >R-ARG1
of  
whom  
were  V01
Saudi  <ARG2
.  

Zarqawi  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
Jordanian  <ARG2
,  
and  
his  
Monotheism  
and  
Holy  
War  
group  >>ARG1
in  
Afghanistan  
probably  >>ARGM-ADV
had  V03
a  
distinctive  >ARGM-ADJ
coloration  V01
as  
mainly  
Jordanian  <ARG2
,  
Palestinian  
and  
Syrian  
.  

They  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-DIS
had  V03
a  
special  >ARGM-ADJ
connection  V01
to  
some  
extremists  <ARG2
in  
Jordan  
and  
Germany  
.  

They  >>ARG1
are  V03
probably  >ARGM-ADV
especially  >ARGM-EXT
oriented  V01
toward  
the  
Salafi  
school  >>ARG0
of  
modern  >ARGM-ADJ
Islamic  >ARG0
thought  V01
,  
which  >R-ARG0
has  V03
a  
Protestant  
-  
like  >ARGM-ADJ
emphasis  V01
on  
going  V19
back  
to  
the  
original  
practice  <ARG2
of  
the  
early  
companions  
of  
the  
Prophet  
Muhammad  
.  

(  
Most  
Salafis  >>ARG1
are  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
militant  <ARG2
or  
violent  V01
,  
though  
they  >>ARG1
tend  V02
to  
be  V01
rather  
narrow  
-  
minded  <ARG2
in  
my  >ARG0
experience  V01
,  
on  
the  
order  <<ARGM-ADV
of  
Protestant  
Pietists  
)  
.  

Monotheism  >>>ARG0
and  
Holy  
War  
obviously  >>>ARGM-ADV
does  V01
have  VLV
a  
violent  >ARGM-ADJ
interpretation  V01
of  
Salafism  <ARG1
,  
rather  
as  
the  
the  
leaders  
of  
the  
so  
-  
called  
German  
Peasant  
Rebellion  
among  
early  
Protestants  
did  V01
.  

Another  
worrisome  >ARGM-ADJ
sign  V07
is  V01
that  
local  
Iraqi  
Sunni  
fundamentalists  >>>ARG0
opposed  V01
to  
the  
US  
presence  <ARG1
in  
Iraq  
have  V01
begun  V02
joining  V04
Monotheism  <ARG1
and  
Holy  
War  
,  
and  
wearing  V01
its  
distinctive  
orange  
and  
black  
insignia  <ARG1
.  

These  >>>ARG1
have  V01
been  V03
sighted  V01
among  
Iraqi  
crowds  <ARGM-LOC
on  
Haifa  
Street  
in  
Baghdad  
and  
in  
Samarra  
.  

So  >ARGM-ADV
now  >ARGM-TMP
there  
are  V02
hundreds  <ARG1
of  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
members  
in  
Iraq  >>ARGM-LOC
where  >>R-ARGM-LOC
there  
had  V01
been  V02
none  <ARG1
before  <ARGM-TMP
.  

The  
consolidation  V01
of  
smaller  
local  
radical  
fundamentalist  
groups  <ARG1
with  
al  
-  
Qaeda  <ARG2
can  >>ARGM-MOD
also  >>ARGM-DIS
be  V03
seen  V01
in  
the  
case  V04
of  
the  
Fizazi  
group  <ARG1
in  
Tangiers  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
morphed  V01
into  
the  
Moroccan  
Islamic  
Combatant  
Group  >ARG0
,  
had  V03
members  >>>ARG0
who  >>>R-ARG0
met  V03
with  
September  
11  
ringleader  <ARG1
Muhammad  
Atta  
,  
and  
ultimately  >>ARGM-ADV
was  V01
in  
part  >ARGM-EXT
responsible  V03
for  
the  
Madrid  >ARGM-LOC
train  >ARG1
bombings  V01
.  

The  
September  
11  
Panel  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
issue  V01
its  >ARG0
findings  V01
on  
Thursday  <<ARGM-TMP
.  

It  >ARG0
notes  V01
10  
points  >>ARGM-ADJ
at  
which  >>R-ARGM-ADJ
the  
US  >>ARG0
made  VLV
key  >ARGM-ADJ
mistakes  V02
that  >>R-ARG0
might  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
stopped  V01
Bin  >ARG0
Laden  
's  
plot  V01
.  

Four  >ARG1
of  
these  
were  V01
under  
Clinton  <ARG2
and  
6  
under  
Bush  
.  

Bush  >>ARG0
came  V09
out  
today  <ARGM-TMP
and  
said  V01
that  
if  
he  >>ARG0
had  V01
known  V01
what  >>ARG1
was  V03
coming  V03
,  
he  >>>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
expended  V01
every  
effort  V01
to  
stop  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
and  
that  
so  
would  
have  V01
Clinton  
.  

This  
statement  V01
is  V01
,  
despite  
its  
facade  <ARGM-ADV
of  
fair  
-  
mindedness  
,  
so  
many  
weasel  
words  <ARG2
.  

Of  >>ARGM-ADV
course  
Bush  >>>ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
tried  V01
to  
stop  V01
9/11  <ARG1
if  
he  >>ARG0
had  V01
known  V01
it  >>ARG1
was  V03
coming  V03
.  

The  
question  V01
is  V01
,  
"  
Should  >>ARGM-MOD
he  >>ARG0
have  V01
known  V01
it  >>ARG1
was  V03
coming  V03
?  
"  

The  
answer  V01
is  V01
,  
"  
Yes  <ARG2
!  
"  

We  >ARG0
now  >ARGM-TMP
know  V01
that  
Bush  >>>ARG0
and  
his  >ARG0
administration  V01
came  V04
into  
office  <ARG2
obsessed  V01
with  
Iraq  <ARG1
.  

Cheney  >>>ARG0
was  V03
looking  V01
at  
maps  <ARG1
of  
Iraq  
oil  
fields  
and  
muttering  V01
about  
opportunities  <ARG1
for  
US  
companies  
there  
,  
already  <ARGM-TMP
in  
January  <ARGM-TMP
or  
February  
of  
2001  
.  

Wolfowitz  >>>ARG0
contradicted  V01
counter-terrorism  
czar  
Richard  <ARG1
Clarke  
when  >ARGM-TMP
the  
latter  >ARG0
spoke  V01
of  
the  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
threat  <ARG1
,  
insisting  V01
that  
the  
preeminent  
threat  >ARG1
of  
terrorism  
against  
the  
US  
came  V01
from  
Iraq  <ARG3
,  
and  
indicating  V01
he  >ARG0
accepted  V01
Laurie  
Mylroie  
's  
crackpot  
conspiracy  
theory  <ARG1
that  
Saddam  >ARG1
was  V01
behind  
the  
1993  >ARGM-TMP
World  
Trade  
Towers  >ARG1
bombing  V01
.  

If  
you  >>ARG0
believe  V01
crackpot  
theories  <ARG1
instead  
of  
focusing  V01
on  
the  
reality  <ARG2
--  
that  >ARG1
was  V01
an  
al  
-  
Qaeda  >ARG0
operation  V01
mainly  >ARGM-ADV
carried  V03
out  
by  
al  <ARG0
-  
Gamaa  
al  
-  
Islamiyyah  
,  
an  
Egyptian  
terrorist  
component  >ARG1
allied  V01
with  
Bin  <ARG2
Laden  
--  
then  >ARGM-ADV
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
concentrate  V01
on  
the  
wrong  
threat  <ARG1
.  

Even  
after  
the  
attacks  V01
on  
September  <ARGM-TMP
11  
,  
Bush  >>ARG0
was  V03
obsessing  V01
about  
Iraq  <ARG1
.  

Wolfowitz  >>ARG0
lied  V08
to  
him  <ARG2
and  
said  V01
that  
there  
was  V02
a  
10  
to  
50  
%  >ARGM-EXT
chance  V02
that  
Iraq  >ARG1
was  V01
behind  
them  <ARG2
.  

(  
On  
what  
evidence  
?  

The  
hijackers  >ARG1
were  V01
obviously  <ARGM-ADV
al  
-  
Qaeda  <ARG2
,  
and  
no  
operational  
links  >>>ARG1
between  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
and  
Iraq  
had  V01
ever  >>ARGM-TMP
been  V03
found  V01
)  
.  

Rumsfeld  >>>ARG0
initially  >ARGM-TMP
rejected  V01
an  
attack  V01
on  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
bases  <ARG1
in  
Afghanistan  
,  
saying  V01
there  
were  V02
"  
no  
good  
targets  <ARG1
"  
in  
Afghanistan  <ARGM-LOC
.  

(  
What  
about  
40  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
bases  >>ARG0
that  >>R-ARG0
had  V01
trained  V01
the  
9/11  
hijackers  <ARG2
and  
other  
terrorists  >ARG0
gunning  V02
for  
the  
United  
States  <ARG1
??  
)  

The  
Pentagon  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
even  >ARGM-ADV
have  V03
a  
plan  V01
for  
dealing  V01
with  
Afghanistan  <ARG1
or  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
that  >R-ARG1
it  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
pull  V01
off  
the  
shelf  <ARG2
,  
according  
to  
Bob  <<<ARGM-ADV
Woodward  
.  

Bush  >>ARG0
did  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
his  
eye  <ARG1
on  
the  
ball  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Neither  
did  
Cheney  
,  
Rumsfeld  
,  
or  
Wolfowitz  
.  

They  >>ARG0
were  V03
playing  V02
Captain  
Ahab  <ARG1
to  
Saddam  
's  
great  
white  
whale  <ARGM-GOL
.  

Imperial  
Hubris  >>ARG0
makes  VLV
the  
case  V03
that  
lots  >ARG0
of  
people  
in  
the  
CIA  
and  
counter-terrorism  
divisions  
elsewhere  
in  
the  
US  
government  
knew  V01
all  
about  
Bin  <ARG1
Laden  
and  
the  
threat  >ARG1
he  >ARG0
posed  V02
.  

They  >>>ARG1
were  V03
from  
all  
accounts  V01
marginalized  V01
and  
not  >ARGM-NEG
listened  V01
to  <C-ARG1
.  

Bush  >ARG0
demoted  V01
Dick  <ARG1
Clarke  
,  
among  
the  
most  
vocal  
and  
focused  
of  
the  
al  
-  
Qaeda  
experts  
,  
from  
his  
cabinet  <ARG3
.  

Dick  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
never  >ARGM-NEG
thereafter  >ARGM-TMP
get  V01
any  
real  >ARGM-ADJ
cooperation  V01
from  
the  
cabinet  
officers  >ARG0
,  
who  >R-ARG0
outranked  V01
him  <ARG1
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
convince  V01
them  >ARG0
to  
go  V02
to  
battle  
stations  <ARG4
in  
the  
summer  <ARGM-TMP
of  
2001  
when  >ARGM-TMP
George  
Tenet  
's  
hair  >ARG1
was  V01
"  
on  
fire  V05
"  
about  
the  
excited  
chatter  >>ARG1
the  
CIA  >>ARG0
was  V03
picking  V11
up  
from  
radical  
Islamist  
terrorists  <ARGM-DIR
.  

As  
for  
the  
Clinton  >>ARGM-ADV
administration  V01
,  
let  V01
me  >ARG0
say  V01
one  
thing  <ARG1
in  
its  >ARG1
defense  V01
.  

Clinton  >>ARG0
had  V01
worked  V02
out  
a  
deal  V01
with  
Pakistani  
Prime  
Minister  <ARG1
Nawaz  
Sharif  
in  
summer  <<ARGM-TMP
of  
1999  
that  >>R-ARG0
would  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
allowed  V01
the  
US  >ARG0
to  
send  V02
a  
Special  
Ops  
team  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
after  
Bin  <ARG2
Laden  
in  
Qandahar  <ARGM-LOC
,  
based  V01
from  
Pakistan  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG0
presume  V01
you  >ARG0
need  V01
the  
Pakistan  
base  <ARG1
for  
rescue  >ARG3
operations  V01
in  
case  
anything  >>ARG1
went  V08
wrong  V02
.  

You  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
need  V01
Pakistani  
air  
space  <ARG1
.  

The  
plan  V01
was  V01
all  >ARGM-EXT
set  V08
and  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
succeeded  V01
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
in  
fall  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
1999  
,  
Gen.  >>ARG0
Pervez  
Musharraf  
made  VLV
a  
coup  V01
against  
Nawaz  <ARG1
Sharif  
.  

The  
Pakistani  
army  >>ARG1
was  V01
rife  V01
with  
elements  <ARG2
protective  
of  
the  
Taliban  
,  
and  
the  
new  
military  
government  >ARG0
reneged  V01
on  
the  
deal  V01
.  

Musharraf  >ARG0
told  V01
Clinton  <ARG2
he  >>ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
use  V01
Pakistani  
soil  <ARG1
or  
air  
space  
to  
send  V02
the  
team  <ARG1
in  <ARGM-DIR
against  
Bin  <ARG2
Laden  
.  

Look  V01
at  
a  
map  <ARG1
and  
you  >>ARG0
try  V01
to  
figure  V05
out  
how  >ARGM-MNR
,  
in  
fall  >ARGM-TMP
of  
1999  
,  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
possibly  >ARGM-ADV
pull  V03
off  
such  
an  
operation  V01
without  
Pakistani  
facilities  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

Of  >ARGM-ADV
course  
,  
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
just  >ARGM-ADV
go  V02
in  <ARGM-DIR
by  
main  
force  <ARGM-MNR
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
for  
those  >>ARGM-PRP
of  
you  
tempted  V01
in  
that  
direction  <ARG3
,  
please  >ARGM-DIS
look  V05
up  
Carter  >ARG0
's  
Tabas  >ARGM-LOC
operation  V01
.  

It  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
easily  >ARGM-ADV
googled  V01
.  

Clinton  >>ARG0
tried  V01
,  
and  
tried  V01
hard  <ARGM-MNR
.  

The  
gods  >ARG1
were  V01
n't  <ARGM-NEG
with  
us  <ARG2
on  
that  
one  <ARGM-ADV
.

is  V01
how  >>ARG2
i  >ARG0
want  V01
you  >ARG0
to  
refer  V01
to  
me  <ARG1

like

John  
,  

Hello  
from  
South  
America  
.  

I  >ARG0
just  >ARGM-TMP
got  V01
your  >ARG0
email  V01
and  
I  >ARG0
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
concur  V01
with  
Jeff  >>ARG0
making  VLV
the  
call  V02
.  

He  >>ARG0
has  V01
maintained  V01
a  
good  >ARGM-ADJ
relationship  V03
with  
Mulva  <ARG2
.  

This  >ARG1
was  V01
a  
risk  V01
that  
we  <ARG0
had  VLV
but  
we  >>>ARG1
did  V01
have  VLV
assurances  V01
from  
Phillips  <ARG0
regarding  
performance  V02
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
how  
much  >ARGM-EXT
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
help  V01
however  <<ARGM-DIS
.  

Richard  >ARG0
Harper  
and  
Mary  
Nell  
Browning  
may  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
some  
ideas  <ARG1
here  <ARGM-ADV
but  
I  >>ARG0
am  V01
sure  V02
you  >>ARG0
've  V01
already  >ARGM-TMP
gone  V06
through  
it  <ARG1
with  
them  <ARGM-COM
.  

I  >>ARG1
am  V01
amazed  V01
how  >>ARGM-MNR
the  
details  >>ARG1
get  V03
fuzzy  V01
on  
an  
old  
project  <ARGM-PRD
.  

When  >ARGM-TMP
you  >ARG0
discussed  V01
it  <ARG1
,  
i  >>>ARG0
was  V03
trying  V01
to  
think  V01
back  <ARG1
to  
our  >ARG0
remedies  
and  
discussions  V01
but  
the  
3  
years  >>ARG0
have  V01
made  V02
it  >ARG1
difficult  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
know  V01
if  
there  
is  V02
anything  >ARG1
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
but  
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V01
always  >ARGM-TMP
willing  V02
to  
help  V01
.  

Good  
luck  
,  

Mike  

These

is  V01
it  <ARG1

I  >>ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD

to

I  >>ARG0

Hi

Thought  V01
that  
you  >>ARG1
might  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
interested  V01
.  

Best

Jeff  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
he  >ARG1
launched  V01
today  <ARGM-TMP

Have  V01
you  >ARG0
seen  V01
the  
materials  <ARG1
from  
the  
press  >ARG0
conference  V01
that  >R-ARG1
he  >ARG0
launched  V01
today  <ARGM-TMP
?  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
this  >ARG1
is  V01
actually  <ARGM-ADV
a  
good  
thing  <ARG2
--  
makes  V02
our  >ARG0
proposal  V01
look  V02
like  
a  
much  
more  
preferable  
alternative  <ARG1
by  
comparison  V01
,  
makes  V02
our  >ARG0
support  V01
in  
the  
process  V02
more  >ARGM-EXT
important  V01
,  
and  
sets  V03

Ralph

Hi

Well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
you  >ARG0
know  V01
it  <ARG1
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V03
not  >ARGM-NEG
driving  V01
tonite  <ARGM-TMP
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
bet  V01
that  
we  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
hitch  V01
a  
ride  V01
back  <<ARGM-DIR
with  
Anil  <<ARGM-COM
.  

I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
sure  V02
,  
but  
I  >ARG0
think  V01
that  
he  >>ARG0
's  V01
got  V02
class  <ARG1
tonite  <ARGM-TMP
,  
too  <ARGM-DIS
.  

I  >>>ARG0
'll  >>>ARGM-MOD
search  V01
him  <ARG2
out  <ARGM-PRD
before  
class  <ARGM-TMP
or  
after  
that  
break  V19
and  
see  V01
if  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
set  V03
it  <ARG1
up  <C-V

we  >>ARG1
are  V01
finished  V01
.  

i  >>ARG0
need  V01
to  
now  >ARGM-TMP
get  V01
a  
job  <ARG1
at  
house  
of  
pies  
b/c  
that  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
only  
way  >ARGM-MNR
to  
pay  V01
the  
bills  <ARG2
.  

the  
economy  >ARG1
is  V01
down  <ARG2
and  
when  >ARGM-TMP
enron  >ARG1
collapses  V01
,  
the  
energy  
industry  >>>ARG1
is  V03
going  V04
to  
be  V01
in  
a  
world  <ARG2
of  
hurt  
.  

not  
to  
mention  
the  
market  >>>ARG1
is  V03
going  V04
to  
be  V03
flooded  V01
with  
enron  
folks  <ARG2
.  

ca  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
go  V02
to  
any  
more  
lsu  
games  <ARG4
unless  
i  >ARG0
get  V01
a  
free  
ticket  <ARG1
.  

Since  
work  V01
has  V01
gone  V01
to  
hell  <ARG4
,  
I  >>>ARG0
am  V03
hoping  V01
to  
find  V01
some  
excitement  V01
in  
the  
possibility  <<ARGM-LOC
that  
LSU  >ARG0
may  >ARGM-MOD
play  V01
in  
the  
Cotton  
Bowl  <ARGM-LOC
(  
if  
Rohan  >ARG1

Alabama  
"  
Davey  
shows  V02
up  
for  
the  
next  
3  
games  <ARGM-PRP
.  
)  

However  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
purchase  V01
tickets  <ARG1
until  
it  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
done  >ARGM-ADJ

i  >>ARG0
am  V01
sure  V02
i  >>ARG0
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
persuaded  V01
you  >ARG0
to  
give  V01
me  <ARG2
some  
action  V02
.  

why  >>ARGM-CAU
is  V03

?  

i  >>ARG0
did  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG

i  >>>ARG0

blowing  V06
up

Vince  
,  

We  >>>ARG0
are  V03
still  >ARGM-TMP
trying  V01
to  
work  V01
the  
PSE  
swap  >ARG1
transaction  V01
,  
now  <<ARGM-ADV
that  
the  
forex  
desk  >>>ARG0
has  V01
been  V01
able  V01
to  
find  V01
a  
fix  V02
for  
CPI  <ARG1
in  
the  
market  <<ARGM-LOC
.  

Further  >>>ARGM-ADV
to  
my  
voicemail  
,  
our  
colleagues  >>>ARG0
in  
credit  V01
are  V03
calculating  V01
the  
reserve  <ARG1
on  
the  
PSE  
swap  
.  

They  >>ARG0
are  V03
currently  >ARGM-TMP
using  V01
9.5  
%  >ARG1
fixed  V03
based  
on  
the  
1  
year  
implied  V01
volatility  <ARG1
.  

Volatility  >>ARG1
of  
USD  
/  
DM  
has  V01
been  V01
in  
the  
range  <ARG2
of  
between  
7  
%  
and  
11  
%  
.  

Can  >ARGM-MOD
one  >ARG0
of  
your  
research  
staff  
justify  V01
a  
suitable  
20  
year  
volalatility  
number  <ARG1
for  
USD  
/  
Euro  
.  

Ideally  >ARGM-ADV
,  
we  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
like  V01
a  
fast  
turnaround  <ARG1
.  

In  
addition  V02
,  
is  V02
there  
someone  >ARG0
who  >R-ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
consider  V02
the  
correlation  V01
between  
US  
CPI  <ARG1
and  
the  
$  
/  
euro  
exchange  
rate  
.  

The  
credit  
guys  >>>ARG0
are  V03
currently  >ARGM-TMP
assuming  V02
that  
there  
is  V02
no  >ARGM-NEG
correlation  V01
and  
may  >>ARGM-MOD
consequently  >>ARGM-ADV
be  V03
double  >ARGM-ADV
dipping  V02
the  
credit  
reserve  <ARG1
on  
this  
basis  <ARGM-MNR
too  <ARGM-ADV
.  

Grateful  
for  
any  
help  V01
or  
suggestions  V01
you  >ARG0
could  >ARGM-MOD
provide  V01
.  

Sid

very  
much  <<ARGM-EXT

I  >>ARG0
was  V03
wondering  V01

Hi  
Sara  
,  

I  >>ARG0
just  >ARGM-ADV
wanted  V01
to  
follow  V03
up  
on  
whether  
you  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
have  V03
a  
chance  V02
to  
send  V01
a  
draft  
Credit  >ARG1
Support  V01
Annex  <<ARG1
(  
similar  
in  
form  
to  
the  
one  >ARG1
previously  >ARGM-TMP
executed  V02
with  
ENA  <ARG3
)  
.  

I  >ARG0
understand  V01
you  
may  
not  
have  VLV
credit  >ARG1
approval  V01
yet  
so  >ARGM-ADV
perhaps  >ARGM-ADV
we  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
leave  V14
the  
appropriate  
sections  <ARG1
blank  <ARG1

Daren

I  >>ARG0
was  V03
wondering  V01
if  
it  
would  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
OK  <ARG2
for  
me  >>ARG0
to  
sit  V05
in  
with  
you  <ARGM-COM
one  
day  <ARGM-TMP
to  
get  V01
a  
general  
feel  <ARG1
of  
your  
end  
of  
the  
process  V02
.  

Pat  >>ARG0
had  V01
told  V01
me  <ARG2
before  
he  >ARG0
left  V11
that  
it  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
help  V01
me  >ARG0
better  >ARGM-EXT
grasp  V01
the  
process  V02
as  
a  
whole  <<ARGM-MNR
.  

I  >ARG0
understand  V01
the  
imminent  
cold  
weather  >>ARG0
is  V03
making  V02
things  >ARG1
crazy  V03
,  
so  >ARGM-ADV
now  >ARG2
may  >ARGM-MOD
not  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
the  
best  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
be  V01
in  
your  >ARG1
way  V01
.  

But  
let  V01
me  >ARG0
know  V01
if  
I  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
spend  V02
a  
day  <ARG1
,  
morning  
,  
or  
even  
just  
an  
afternoon  
down  
there  <ARGM-LOC
with  
you  <ARGM-COM
whenever  >ARGM-TMP
it  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
good  
time  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
it  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD
help  V01
me  <ARG2
very  
much  <ARGM-EXT
in  
my  
role  <ARG1
.  

Thanks  V01

The  
Dow  >ARG1
topped  V05
out  
in  
February  <ARGM-TMP
of  
1966  
at  
995  <ARG2
.  

By  
September  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
that  
year  
the  
Dow  >>ARG1
had  V01
tumbled  V01
to  
744  <ARG4
.  

The  
Dow  >ARG1
then  >ARGM-TMP
rallied  V02
to  
a  
high  <ARG4
of  
943  
in  
September  <ARGM-TMP
of  
'67  
.  

By  
March  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
'68  
the  
Dow  >>>ARG1
had  V01
fallen  V01
to  
825  <ARG4
,  
only  >ARGM-ADV
to  
climb  V02
to  
a  
highly  
speculative  
peak  <ARG4
of  
985  
in  
December  <ARGM-TMP
of  
'68  
.  

The  
Dow  >ARG1
then  >ARGM-TMP
sank  V01
to  
631  <ARG4
in  
December  <ARGM-TMP
of  
'70  
.  

By  
April  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
'71  
the  
Dow  >>>ARG1
had  V01
climbed  V02
back  <ARGM-DIR
to  
950  <ARG4
,  
only  >ARGM-ADV
to  
fall  V01
to  
869  <ARG4
in  
February  <ARGM-TMP
of  
'72  
.  

A  
big  >ARGM-ADJ
rally  V01
then  >ARGM-TMP
took  V01
the  
Dow  <ARG1
(  
unconfirmed  
)  
to  
a  
record  
high  <ARG3
of  
1051  
in  
January  <ARGM-TMP
of  
'73  
,  
turning  V02
everyone  <ARG1
bullish  <ARG2
.  

But  >>ARGM-DIS
by  
December  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
'73  
the  
Dow  >>ARG1
had  V01
collapsed  V02
to  
788  <ARG4
.  

Think  V01
that  >>ARG1
was  V01
bad  V07
-  
by  
December  >>ARGM-TMP
of  
'74  
the  
Dow  >>ARG1
had  V01
sunk  V01
to  
a  
bear  
market  
low  <ARG4
of  
577  
.  

At  
that  
time  >>ARGM-TMP
,  
the  
gurus  >>ARG0
and  
geniuses  
of  
Wall  
Street  
were  V03
predicting  V01
a  
250  
Dow  <ARG1
and  
many  >>ARG0
were  V03
talking  V01
openly  <ARGM-MNR
about  
the  
end  V01
of  
capitalism  <ARG1
.  

Of  >ARGM-DIS
course  
,  
that  >ARG1
was  V01
the  
bottom  <ARG2

And  
that  >ARG1
's  V01
the  
way  V01
the  
greatest  
bear  
market  >ARG0
since  
the

worked  V06
its  >ARG0
way  V01
down  <<ARGM-DIR
.  

By  
late  
1974  >>ARGM-TMP
investors  >>ARG1
were  V01
dizzy  V02
,  
they  >>ARG0
were  V01
desperate  V01
,  
they  >>ARG1

they  >>ARG0

The  
results  >>>ARG1
of  
the  
February  >ARGM-TMP
26th  
PVT  >ARG2
test  V01
conducted  V01
on  
Nville  <ARGM-GOL
have  V01
been  V03
discussed  V01
with  
each  <ARG2
of  
you  
over  
the  
last  
three  
months  <ARGM-TMP
.  

As  
we  >>ARG0
have  V01
discussed  V01
....  
effective  V04
Sep  <ARGM-TMP
13th  
,  
Anita  >>>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
make  VLV
the  
adjustments  V01
to  
Enron  
's  
inventory  <ARG1
and  
pad  
gas  
to  
reflect  V01
the  
February  
26th  
results  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
talked  V01
with  
Gary  <ARG2
Wilson  
,  
and  
he  >ARG0
confirmed  V01
that  
the  
revised  
values  >>ARG1
are  V01
correct  V02
.  

Attached  V01
is  V03
a  
spreadsheet  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
contains  V01
the  
values  <ARG1
.  

The  
correction  V01
to  
the  
working  
gas  <ARG1
includes  V01
TWO  
corrections  V01
.  

The  
results  >>ARG0
of  
the  
February  >ARGM-TMP
26th  
test  V01
reduces  V01
the  
working  
gas  <ARG1
by  
398,487  
MMBTU  <ARG2
.  

In  
addition  V02
,  
there  
is  V02
a  
reduction  V01
of  
22,101  
MMBTU  >ARG1
which  >R-ARG1
is  V01
the  
difference  V02
between  
the  
SCADA  
values  >ARG1
(  
Best  
Available  
)  
that  >R-ARG1
Anita  >ARG0
showed  V01
on  
the  
February  
29th  
Storage  
Sheet  <ARGM-LOC
and  
the  
"  
official  
"  
February  
29th  
values  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
Gary  >ARG0
Wilson  
received  V01
from  
MIPS  <ARG2
.  

To  
summarize  V01
:  
Enron  
's  
pad  
gas  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
now  >ARGM-TMP
be  V01
3,993,310  
MMBTU  <ARG2
,  
instead  
of  
4,223,000  
MMBTU  
.  

Enron  
's  
working  
gas  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
reduced  V01
by  
420,588  
MMBTU  <ARG2
.

the  
Enron  >ARG0

and  
Green

Agreement  
(

The  
guaranty  >>ARG1
for  
the  
PPA  
is  V03
blacklined  V01
against  
the  
Enron  
EPC  
Contract  
guaranty  <ARG2
in  
favor  <ARGM-ADV
of  
the

which  >>ARG1
was  V03
granted  V01
in  
connection  V01
with  
our  
Cabazon  
Wind  
Power  
Project  <ARG2
(  
the

most  
recently  >ARGM-TMP
financed  V01

and  
the

guaranty  >>ARG1
is  V03
blacklined  V01
against  
the  
PPA  
guaranty  <ARG2

As  
we  >ARG0
discussed  V01
last  
week  <ARGM-TMP
,  
since  
the  
Enron  
guaranties  >>ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
need  V01
to  
be  V01
in  
a  
form  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
acceptable  V02
to  
our  
project  
lenders  <ARG0
and  
equity  
participants  
,  
we  >ARG0
thought  V01
that  
we  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
start  V01
with  
a  
form  >>>ARG2
that  >>R-ARG1
was  V03
used  V01
in  
our  >ARG0
last  >ARGM-TMP
financing  V02
and  
that  >>R-ARG2
was  V03
negotiated  V01
by  
Enron  <ARG0
and  
the  
banks  
.  

We  >>ARG0
plan  V01
to  
use  V01
the  
same  
basic  
form  <ARG1
for  
the  
Enron  >ARG0
guaranty  V01
that  
will  <ARGM-MOD
be  V03
made  VLV
in

respect  V02
to  
the

a

everyday  <ARGM-TMP

This

be  V03
imposed  V01
by

purported  V01
to

Your  >ARG0

to  
introduce  V02
the  
concept  >ARG1
discussed  V01
with  
one  <ARG2
of  
the  
Lays  
is  V03
welcomed  V01

I  >ARG0
hope  V01
that  
this  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
mean  V01
that  
you  >>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
remain  V01
involved  V01
at  
some  
level  <ARGM-ADV
.  

The  
design  V01
of  
the  
model  <ARG1

its  
potential  
economics  
could  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
key  V02
to  
how  
worthy  >>ARG2
the  
effort  V01
might  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
.  

Enron  >ARG1

which  >>>R-ARGM-DIR
to  
the

enhancement  >>>ARG1
through

commercialization  V01
could  >>ARGM-MOD

successfully  >ARGM-MNR

Please  >>>ARGM-DIS
confidentially  >>>ARGM-MNR
share  V01
matters  <ARG1
as  
you  >ARG0
think  V01
best  V02

ask  V01

well  
.  

Vince  

I  >ARG0
thought  V01
that  
since  
Chonawee  >ARG0
has  V03
an  
optimization  
background  <ARG1
,  
he  
would  >>ARGM-MOD

dinner  <ARG4

this  >>ARG1

fine  V04
?

launch  V01
to  
the

on  
sleek  
,

the  
first

this  
country  >>ARG0

developed  V02
in  
more  
than  
a  
decade  <ARGM-TMP
,  
NASA  >>ARG0
and  
the  
Pentagon  
have  V01
told  V01
the  
White  
House  <ARG2
.  

Lunar  
landers  >>>ARG1
and  
other  
gear  >ARG1
needed  V01
for  
extended  >ARGM-ADJ
visits  V01
to  
the

will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V03
lofted  V01
by  
gargantuan

as  
big  
as  
the  
Apollo

era  
Saturn  
5  
,  
the  
most  
powerful  
rockets  >ARG1
ever  >ARGM-TMP
flown  V01
.  

It  >ARG0
looks  V02
as  
if  
NASA  >>ARG1
is  V03
transitioning  V01
away  <ARGM-DIR
from  
the  
shuttle  
model  <ARG3
,  
as  
in  
the  
past  >>ARGM-TMP
they  >>>ARG0
have  V01
proven  V01
to  
be  V01
quite  >ARGM-EXT
dangerous  V01
as  
Columbia  >>ARG0
has  V01
recently  >ARGM-TMP
proved  V01
.  

Although  
these  
new  
rockets  >>ARG1
are  V01
probably  >ARGM-ADV
more  >ARGM-EXT
expensive  V02
,  
they  >>>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
able  V01
to  
go  V01
at  
a  
much  
greater  
range  <ARG2
than  
it's  
shuttle  
cousins  
,  
as  
they  >>>ARG0
can  >>>ARGM-MOD
not  
only  
break  V16
free  V04
from  
the  
atmosphere  <<ARG1

reach  V01
the  
moon  <ARG1
as  <ARGM-ADV
well  
.  

"  
NASA  >ARG0

"  
NASA  >>ARG0

develop  V02
a  
new  
100  
-  
metric  
-  
ton  
-  
class  
launch  
vehicle  >ARG1
derived  V01
from  
existing  
capabilities  <ARG2
with  
the  
space  
shuttle  
external  
tanks  
and  
solid  
rocket  
boosters  
for  
future  >ARGM-TMP
missions  V01
to  
the  
moon  <ARGM-DIR
,  
"  
the  
letter  >ARG0
said  V01
.  

NASA  >>ARG0
is  V03
planning  V01
on  
using  V01
these  
new  
shuttles  <ARG1
to  
replace  V01
the  
current  >ARGM-TMP
models  V01
,  
with  
industry  
forecasters  >ARG0
predicting  V01
a  
launch  V01
as  
early  <ARGM-TMP
as  
2014  
.  

The  
new  >ARGM-ADJ
rocket  >ARG1
design  V01
will  >ARGM-MOD
differ  V02
slightly  <ARGM-EXT
from  
it's  
predecessors  <ARG2
,  
in  
the  
fact  <ARG3
that  
the  
crew  >>ARG0
and  
cargo  
would  >>ARGM-MOD
launch  V01
separately  <ARGM-MNR
from  
two  
different  
rockets  <ARGM-DIR
each  <ARGM-ADV
and  
join  V02
up  
in  
space  <ARGM-LOC
later  
on  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Launching  V01
this  
way  V01
will  >ARGM-MOD
hopefully  >ARGM-ADV
avoid  V01
future  
disasters  <ARG1
,  
giving  VLV
more  >ARGM-EXT
support  V01
towards  
NASA  >ARG0
revisiting  V01
the  
stars  <ARG1

a

up  <C-V

Is  V01
that  <ARG1
what  >>ARG1
you  >>ARG0

You  >>ARG0

Does  V01
a

a

Or  
maybe  
something

?  

I  >ARG0
assume  V02
you  >>ARG0
are  V03
talking  V01
about  
a  
pacman

.  

No  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
technically  >>ARGM-ADV
they  >>ARG0
do  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
need  V01
a  
UVB

;  
they  >ARG1
are  V01
nocturnal  <ARG2
.  

However  >ARGM-DIS
,  
it  >ARG0
certainly  >ARGM-ADV
would  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
hurt  V01
if  
you  >>ARG0
wanted  V01
to  
provide  V01
one  <ARG1
.  

A

about

there  
's  V02
nothing  <ARG1
distinctly

You  >ARG0
'd  >ARGM-MOD

prefer  V01
a

relatively  
waterproof  <ARG2

to  
the

ASAP  <ARGM-TMP

esp

eating  V01

if  
it  >>ARG1
had  V01
only  >ARGM-ADV
happened  V01
once  <ARGM-TMP
and  
could  >ARGM-MOD
get  V04
him  >ARG0
to  
eat  V01
right  
away  <ARGM-TMP
-  
it  >>ARG1
could  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V01
you  >ARG0
missed  V02
his  
meal  
time  <ARG1
and  
he  >>ARG0
needed  V01
to  
eat  V01
-  
since  
it  >ARG1
sounds  V01
like  
it  >>ARG1
has  V01
happened  V01
several  
times  <ARGM-TMP
over  
two  
days  <ARGM-TMP
-  
then  >>ARGM-ADV
he  >>ARG1
may  >>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
gotten  V03
int  
to  
something  >>>ARG1
that  >>>R-ARG1
needs  V01
to  
be  V03

!!!  

or  
has  V01
acquired  V01
some  
type  <ARG1
of  
disease  
and  
that  >>>ARG1
too  
needs  V01
to  
be  V03
attended  V01
to  <C-ARG1
...  

why  >ARGM-PRP
are  V02
there  
two  
statues  <ARG1
of  
David  
?  

i  >ARG0
doing  V02
a  
research  
paper  <ARG1
on  
donatello  
and  
i  >ARG0
notice  V01
that  
there  
are  V02
two  
statues  <ARG1
of  
David  
,  
a  
bronze  
one  
and  
marble  
one  
.  

Michelangelo  >ARG0
made  V01
the  
marble  
one  <ARG1
but  
why  >>ARGM-CAU
did  V01
he  >ARG0
do  V02
another  <ARG1
if  
Donatello  >>ARG0
had  V01
already  >ARGM-TMP
made  V01
one  <ARG1
?  

so  >>ARGM-DIS
i  >>ARG1
m  V01
a  
little  >ARGM-EXT
confused  V01
,  
why  >ARGM-PRP
is  V02
there  
two  
statues  <ARG1
of  
David  
?  

different  
generations  
,  
the  
donatello  >ARG1
is  V01
of  
a  
boy  
david  <ARG2
as  
a  
young  
sheep  
Herder  
,  
the  
Michelangelo  >ARG1
is  V01
the  
grown  
up  
man  
david  <ARG2
as  
slayer  
and  
king  

Because  
he  >>ARG0
liked  V01
making  V01
statues  <ARG1
of  
David  
!  
:D  

Obviously  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
he  >>>ARG1
should  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V03
arrested  V01
and  
jailed  V01
-  
imagine  V01
making  V01
a  
statue  <ARG1
or  
painting  
on  
the  
same  
subject  
as  
another  
artist  
-  
clearly  
insulting  
and  
disrespecting  
-  
wasted  
time  >>>ARG0
that  >>>R-ARG0
could  >>>ARGM-MOD
have  V01
been  V03
used  V01
making  V01
a  
statue  <ARG1
with  
clothes  
on  
.  

Name  
of  
specific  
Hibachi  
restaurant  
in  
Chicago  
?  

I  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
friend  <ARG1
out  
in  
Chicago  
this  
week  
,  
and  
I  >>>ARG0
am  V03
trying  V01
to  
remember  V01
the  
name  <ARG1
of  
an  
awesome  
hibachi  
style  
restaurant  >ARG1
i  >ARG0
visited  V01
while  
out  
there  <ARGM-TMP
a  
couple  
years  
ago  <ARGM-TMP
.  

I  >ARG0
think  V01
it  >ARG1
was  V01
in  
the  
Lincoln  
Square  
area  <ARG2
but  
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
quote  V01
me  <ARG2
on  
that  <ARG3
.  

It's  
'  
gimmick  >ARG1
'  
was  V01
that  
you  >>ARG0
fill  V01
your  
bowl  <ARG1
cafeteria  
-  
style  <ARGM-MNR
from  
raw  
ingredients  <ARG2
and  
leave  V12
it  <ARG1
on  
the  
counter  <ARG2
with  
a  
chopstick  >ARG0
listing  V01
your  
table  
number  <ARG1
on  
it  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Four  
guys  >ARG0
around  
a  
large  
square  
open  
hibachi  
cook  V01
your  
food  <ARG1
,  
and  
when  >>ARGM-TMP
it  >>ARG1
's  V03
finished  V01
a  
server  >ARG0
brings  V01
it  <ARG1
to  
your  
table  <ARG2
.  

All  
-  
you  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
-  
eat  V01
style  >ARG2
deal  V01
.  

It  >ARG1
was  V01
pretty  
epic  <ARG2
as  
I  >ARG0
remember  V01
and  
would  >ARGM-MOD
love  V02
to  
send  V01
my  
friend  <ARG1
there  <ARG2
.  

Any  
help  V01
?  

That  >ARG1
is  V01
Flat  
Top  
Grill  <ARG2

What  >ARG2
's  V01
the  
best  
time  >ARGM-TMP
to  
start  V01
a  
trip  V03
around  
the  
world  <ARG1
?  

Well  >ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
about  <ARG2
to  
graduate  V01
in  
less  
then  
a  
year  <ARGM-TMP
,  
and  
I  >>>ARG0
'm  V03
planning  V01
to  
study  V01
medical  
school  <ARG1
.  

But  
since  
in  
my  
country  >ARGM-LOC
it  >ARG1
lasts  V01
for  
minimum  <ARGM-ADV
6  
years  <ARG2
,  
and  
I  >>ARG0
want  V01
to  
go  V02
aground  
the  
world  <ARG1
,  
what  >>ARG1
do  V01
you  >ARG0
think  V01
,  
should  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
do  V02
it  <ARG1
before  
or  
after  
medical  
school  <ARGM-TMP
?  

If  
you  >>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
afford  V01
to  
go  V02
before  <ARGM-TMP
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
by  
all  
means  >ARGM-ADV
,  
GO  V02
.  

If  
you  >>ARG1
have  V02
to  
wait  V01
,  
due  
to  
financial  
reasons  <ARGM-CAU
,  
then  >ARGM-ADV
wait  V01
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
much  
rather  >ARGM-ADV
put  V06
it  <ARG1
off  <C-V
until  
I  >>>ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
afford  V01
to  
have  VLV
the  
vacation  V01
of  
a  
lifetime  <ARGM-ADJ
as  
I  >>ARG0
'm  V01
sure  V02
this  
trip  V03
is  V03
intended  V01
to  
be  V01
.  

Airfare  >>ARG1
alone  
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
incredibly  >ARGM-EXT
expensive  V02
so  >ARGM-ADV
make  V02
sure  V01
you  >>>ARG0
have  V03
the  
money  >>ARGM-ADV
and  
of  
course  
free  
time  
to  
take  V01
your  
time  <ARG1
and  
have  V03
a  
great  
time  <ARG1
.  

canon  
t2i  >>ARG1
stops  V01
working  V09
?  

My  
canon  
t2i  >>ARG1
stops  V01
working  V09
at  
times  <ARGM-TMP
as  
in  
the  
power  
bottom  >>ARG1
is  V03
switched  V01
to  
"  
on  <ARG2
"  
but  
the  
camera  >>ARG0
does  V01
not  >ARGM-NEG
respond  V01
to  
any  
function  V01
.  

the  
camera  >>ARG1
only  >ARGM-ADV
begins  V02
to  
work  V09
again  <ARGM-TMP
when  >>ARGM-TMP
i  >>ARG0
take  V11
out  
the  
battery  <ARG1
and  
put  V01
it  <ARG1
back  <ARGM-DIR
in  <ARG2
.  

did  V01
anyone  >>ARG1
have  VLV
this  
issue  V02
?  

is  V01
it  <ARG1
worthy  V02
to  
send  V01
in  <ARG2
for  
warranty  >ARGM-ADJ
repair  V01
?  

thanks  V01
!  

Sounds  V01
simple  V02
enough  V01
to  
me  <ARGM-GOL
.  

Your  
camera  >>ARG0
is  V03
n't  >ARGM-NEG
acting  V01
normally  <ARG1
,  
you  >ARG0
got  V01
warranty  <ARG1
,  
let  V01
Canon  >ARG0
deal  V01
with  
it  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
agree  V01
.  

I  >>>ARG1
shoot  V03
a  
t1i  <ARG1
and  
have  V01
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
had  VLV
such  
an  
issue  V02
.  

I  >ARG0
also  >ARGM-ADV
agree  V01
it  >ARG1
's  V01
under  
warranty  <ARG2
so  >ARGM-ADV
get  V03
in  
touch  V01
with  
Canon  <<ARG2
.  

It  >ARG1
sounds  V01
like  
a  
firmware  >ARG0
issue  V02
and  
the  
camera  >ARG0
requires  V01
a  
re-boot  <ARG1
just  
like  
what  >ARG1
happens  V01
in  
a  
computer  <ARG2
-  
needs  V01
a  
re-start  <ARG1
from  
time  <ARGM-TMP
to  
time  
but  
it  >>ARG1
should  >>ARGM-MOD
n't  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
happening  V01
in  
a  
camera  <ARG2
.

I  >>ARG0
decided  V01
to  
get  V01
a  
150  
gal  
aquarium  <ARG1
,  
what  >ARG2
can  >ARGM-MOD
I  >ARG0
fill  V01
it  <ARG1
with  <C-ARG2
?  

I  >>ARG0
was  V03
thinking  V01
cichlids  <ARG1
?  

Possibly  
a  
freshwater  
tank  
with  
a  
ton  
of  
different  
species  
in  
there  
.  

I  >>ARG0
've  V01
never  >ARGM-NEG
kept  V01
cichlids  <ARG1
though  <ARGM-DIS
.  

I  >ARG0
know  V01
saltwater  >ARG1
is  V01
a  
possibility  <ARG2
,  
can  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
give  V01
me  <ARG2
a  
possible  
stocking  
option  <ARG1
for  
that  
too  
?  

I  >ARG0
'll  >ARGM-MOD
choose  V01
the  
one  >ARG1
that  >R-ARG1
sounds  V01
the  
best  <ARG2
after  
looking  V01
into  
all  
the  
fish  <ARG1
:)  

Here  >ARG2
is  V01
the  
stocking  V01
for  
my  
150  
gallon  
tank  <ARG2
i  >ARG0
upgraded  V02
it  <ARG1
to  
200  <ARG4
at  
the  
weekend  <ARGM-TMP
because  
of  
the  
clownloach  <ARGM-CAU
A  
200

with  
6

1

If  
you  >ARG0
took  V11
out  
the  
clown  
loach  <ARG1
it  >ARG1
would  >ARGM-MOD
make  V06
a

.  

fill  V01
it  <ARG1
with

it  >ARG0
keeps  V04
the  
cold  <ARG1

The

okay  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
I  >>ARG0
do  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
have  V03
a  
review  V01
,  
but  
why  >ARGM-CAU
in  
the  
hell  
would  >ARGM-MOD
you  >ARG0
name  V01
your  
business  <ARG1
something  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
has  V03
the  
initials  <ARG1

....  
is  V02
there  
something  <ARG1
behind  
the  
scenes  
at  
this  
place  <ARGM-LOC
?  

Like  >>ARGM-DIS
I  >>ARG1
'm  V01
legitimately  >ARGM-ADJ
concerned  V01
at  
this  
point  <ARGM-TMP
...  
lol  <ARGM-DIS

Fresh  
and  
Excellent  
Quality  

We  >ARG0
order  V02
take  
out  <ARG1
from  
here  <ARG3
all  
the  
time  <ARGM-TMP
and  
we  >ARG1
are  V01
never  <ARGM-NEG
disappointed  <ARG2
.  

The  
food  >>>ARG1
is  V01
always  >>ARGM-TMP
fresh  V04
and  
delicious  V01
.  

It  >ARG1
can  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
a  
little  
on  
the  
spicy  
side  <ARG2
but  
just  >ARGM-ADV
ask  V02
them  <ARG2
exactly  
what  >ARG1
you  >ARG0
want  V01
and  
they  >>ARG0
are  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
helpful  V04
.  

I  >>ARG0
really  >ARGM-ADV
want  V01
to  
like  V01
this  
place  <ARG1
since  
I  >ARG0
work  V01
right  
around  
the  
corner  <ARGM-LOC
.  

Unfortunately  >>>ARGM-ADV
,  
I  >>>ARG0
've  V01
given  VLV
it  >ARG1
a  
couple  >ARGM-ADJ
of  
tries  V01
at  
different  
times  <ARGM-TMP
and  
decided  V01
to  
stop  V01
going  V02
.  

The  
employees  >>>ARG0
do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
really  >ARGM-ADV
seem  V01
to  
enjoy  V01
what  >>ARG1
they  >>ARG0
are  V03
doing  V02
and  
it  >ARG0
shows  V01
.  

Class  
act  
.  

It  >>ARG1
was  V01
late  V01
in  
the  
day  <ARG2
and  
I  >>ARG1
was  V01
worried  V01
I  >>>ARG1
would  >>ARGM-MOD
get  V03
charged  V01
an  
arm  <ARG1
and  
a  
leg  
and  
have  V02
to  
wait  V01
forever  <ARGM-TMP
.  

They  >>ARG0
picked  V04
my  
car  <ARG1
up  <C-V
in  
Yarmouth  <ARGM-LOC
and  
towed  V01
to  
Bath  <ARG2
for  
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ
price  V01
.  

Would  >ARGM-MOD
do  V02
business  <ARG1
with  
them  
again  <ARGM-TMP
.  

Great  >ARGM-ADJ
service  V02

We  >>ARG1

the  
extra  
mile  >ARG1
you  >>ARG0
went  V02
to  
get  V04
out  
computers  >ARG1
working  V09
correctly  <ARGM-MNR
,  
you  >ARG1
will  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
our  >ARG0
first  >ARGM-TMP
call  V02
if  
anything  >ARG1
happens  V01
again  <ARGM-TMP

we  >ARG0
will  >ARGM-MOD

you  <ARG1
to  
other  
people  <ARG2

Do  V01
n't  >ARGM-NEG
judge  V01
a

its  
cover  <ARG3

From  
the  
outside  >ARGM-DIR
Ichiban  >ARG0
looks  V02
like  
it  >>ARG1
will  >>ARGM-MOD
be  V01
terrible  V01
.  

This  >ARG1
could  >ARGM-MOD
n't  >ARGM-NEG
be  V01
farther  <ARG2
from  
the  
truth  
.  

The  
food  >>ARG0
is  V01
amazing  V01
,  
and  
the  
prices  V01
can  >>ARGM-MOD
not  >>ARGM-NEG
be  V03
beat  V03
.  

The  
sushi  >>ARG1
is  V01
great  V01
,  
and  
they  >ARG0
have  V03
a  
great  >ARGM-ADJ

The  
people  >>>ARG1
at

were  V01
very  >>ARGM-EXT
easy  V05
and  
clear  V06
to  
work  V01
with  <ARG3
.  

They  >ARG0
walked  V01
me  <ARG1
through  
all  
the  
steps  V01
involved  <ARGM-ADJ
in  
the  
the  
installation  
project  
so  
that  
there  
were  V02
no  >ARGM-NEG
surprises  V01
.  

I  >>ARG0
found  V02
them  <ARG1
extremely  
professional  <ARG1

frequently  <ARGM-TMP

the

has  V01
been  V01

sprayed  V01
our

He  >>ARG0

how

it  
was  V01
for  
us  >ARG0
to  
make  V02
sure  V01
the  
whole

just  >ARGM-ADV
give  V01
them  <ARG2
guide  <ARG1
and  
they  >ARG0
can  >ARGM-MOD
find  V01
anything  >ARG1
they  >ARG0
need  V01
.  

Thanks  V01
again  <ARGM-TMP
,  
Directv  <ARGM-DIS
.  

Michael  >>ARG0
helped  V01
shoot  V03
the  
majority  <ARG1
of  
my  
firm  
's  
website  
and  
we  >>>ARG1
could  >>>ARGM-MOD
not  >>>ARGM-NEG
have  V01
been  V01
happier  V01
.  

We  >>ARG0
went  V02
through  
six  
photographers  <ARG1
to  
find  V01
the  
right  
photographers  >ARG0
that  >R-ARG0
would  >ARGM-MOD
represent  V01
our  
firm  <ARG1
in  
the  
light  <ARG2
we  >ARG0
wished  V01
to  <ARG1
and  
Michael  >ARG0
and  
his  
team  
made  V02
that  >ARG1
happen  V01
.  

He  >>ARG1
's  V01
worth  V02
every  
penny  <ARG2
.  

Average  
food  
and  
deathly  
slow  >ARGM-MNR
service  V02

I  >>ARG0
have  V01
eaten  V01
here  <ARGM-LOC
several  
times  <ARGM-TMP
and  
every  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
the  
service  V02
is  V01
slower  V05
than  
slow  <ARGM-CXN
.  

One  
time  >ARGM-TMP
we  >ARG0
even  >ARGM-ADV
left  V11
after  
sitting  V01
at  
the  
table  <ARG2
for  
20  
minutes  <ARGM-TMP
and  
not  >>ARGM-NEG
being  V03
greeted  V01
with  
a  
drink  >ARG1
order  V02
.  

Ridiculous  
.  

There  
must  >ARGM-MOD
be  V02
a  
better  
mexican  
place  <ARG1
in  
Rockland  <ARGM-LOC
.  

I  >ARG1
am  V01
in  
love  V01
with  
the  
giant  
plate  <ARG1
of  
nachos  
!  

Last  
time  >>>ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
went  V02
however  >>ARGM-DIS
,  
my  
beer  >>ARG1
was  V01
warm  V07
and  
the  
service  V02
was  V01
so  
-  
so  <ARG2
.  

I  >ARG0
get  V01
that  
careless  
teenager  
kind  <ARG1
of  
treatment  V01
from  
some  <<ARG2
of  
their  
staff  
...  
perhaps  >ARGM-ADV
they  >ARG0
should  >ARGM-MOD
hire  V01
more  
serious  
adults  >>>ARG0
to  
help  V01
serve  V02
/  
cook  V01
.  

nice  
friendly  
local  
bagel  
place  

there  
might  >ARGM-MOD
be  V02
bigger  
and  
more  
well  
known  
bagel  
places  <ARG1
in  
the  
area  <ARGM-LOC
but  
Family  
Bagels  >ARG1
are  V01
nice  
people  <ARG2
,  
small  
shop  
and  
incredibly  
friendly  
.  

While  
other  >>ARG1
may  >ARGM-MOD
be  V01
ok  >>>ARGM-ADV
waiting  V01
in  
line  <ARGM-LOC
at  
Town  
Bagel  <ARGM-LOC

are  V01
happy  V01
with  
the  
quality  >>ARG1
and  
service  V02

Very  
Mediocre  
donuts  
!  

The  
Donuts  >ARG1
were  V01
very  
over  
proofed  <ARG2
,  
making  V02
them  <ARG1
stale  <ARG1
and  
bready  
.  

The  
service  V02
was  V01
friendly  V01
and  
fast  V02
,  
but  
this  >>ARG2
just  >>ARGM-ADV
does  V01
nt  >ARGM-NEG
make  V16
up  
for  
the  
lack  
-  
luster  
product  <ARG1
.  

We  >ARG0
tried  V01
4  
different  
style  <ARG1
of  
donuts  
,  
they  >ARG1
were  V01
all  <ARGM-ADV
the  
same  <ARG2
when  >ARGM-TMP
it  
came  V12
to  
quality  <ARG1
.  

a  
staple  
!  

I  >ARG0
live  V01
in  
the  
neighborhood  <ARGM-LOC
and  
this  
place  >ARG1
is  V01
one  <ARG2
of  
my  
favorites  
for  
a  
tasty  
,  
quick  
and  
inexpensive  
meal  
.  

Branch  V02
out  
and  
try  V01
something  <ARG1
other  
than  
the  
Pad  
Thai  
,  
the  
curries  >>ARG1
are  V01
fantastic  V02
.  

Fast  >ARGM-MNR
and  
friendly  
service  V02
,  
they  >ARG0
know  V01
my  >ARG0
order  V02
when  >ARGM-TMP
I  >ARG0
walk  V01
in  
the  
door  <ARG2
!  

On

was  V01
very  >ARGM-EXT
clean  V04
,  
very  
nice

deep

significantly  >ARGM-EXT
reduced  V01
the  
pain  <ARG1

my  
neck

shoulders
