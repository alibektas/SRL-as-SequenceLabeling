me	_
that	_
the	_

officials	_
in	_
the	_
Sunni	_

is	V.03
being	V.03
done	V.02
wrong	_

or	_
at	_

in	_

added	V.01

said	V.01
the	_
top	_
three	_

be	V.03
announced	V.01
on	_
September	_

8,000	_

5,000	_

This	_
cute	_
little	_
stunt	V.02
is	V.03
only	_
going	V.04
to	_
prove	V.01
just	_
how	_
fanatic	_

When	_

When	_
their	_
precious	_
cartoons	_
are	V.03
released	V.01
I	_
highly	_
doubt	V.01
it	_
will	_
look	V.02
like	_
the	_
end	V.01
of	_
the	_
world	_

some	_

Hundreds	_

against	_
the	_
Fallujah	_

The	_

provoked	V.01
by	_
the	_
US	_
assault	V.01

for	_
protecting	V.01
his	_

still	_

For	_
the	_
last	_
few	_
years	_
there	_
have	V.01
been	V.02
tensions	V.01
with	_
Iran	_
’s	_
nuclear	_
program	_
with	_
word	_
coming	V.03
this	_
week	_
that	_
a	_
deal	V.01
was	V.03
reached	V.01
through	_
the	_
European	_
Union	_
that	_
meets	V.05
with	_
the	_
approval	V.01
of	_
the	_
International	_
Atomic	_
Energy	_
Agency	_
.	_

At	_
the	_
same	_
time	_
,	_
an	_
Iranian	_
Opposition	_
Group	_
released	V.01
what	_
they	_
call	V.01
proof	V.01
of	_
a	_
covert	_
nuclear	_
weapons	_
program	_
.	_

Arial	_
photos	V.01
,	_
loose	_
connections	V.01
to	_
AQ	_
Kahn	_
and	_
Libya	_
make	V.07
up	_
the	_
evidence	_
that	_
the	_
group	_
presented	V.01
.	_

Russia	_
also	_
announced	V.01
that	_
it	_
was	V.03
seeking	V.01
and	_
building	V.01
the	_
best	_
nukes	_
the	_
world	_
’s	V.03
ever	_
seen	V.01
.	_

President	_
Vladimir	_
Putin	_
said	V.01
Russia	_
is	_
will	_
have	V.03
new	_
nuclear	_
weapons	_
that	_
other	_
countries	_
do	V.01
not	_
and	_
will	_
not	_
have	V.03
.	_

With	_
the	_
demand	V.01
so	_
high	V.02
,	_
the	_
question	V.01
arises	V.02
on	_
to	_
who	_
should	_
be	V.01
or	_
has	V.03
the	_
right	V.05
to	_
be	V.01
the	_
Santa	_
of	_
nuclear	_
weapons	_
.	_

Right	_
now	_
that	_
seems	V.01
to	_
be	V.01
the	_
US	_
,	_
EU	_
,	_
and	_
IAEA	_
.	_

But	_
not	_
always	_
do	V.01
those	_
three	_
agree	V.01
,	_
and	_
not	_
always	_
are	V.01
their	_
decisions	V.01
equal	V.01
.	_

The	_
US	_
has	V.01
strongly	_
opposed	V.01
a	_
nuclear	_
weapons	_
program	_
of	_
Iran	_
,	_
yet	_
Israel	_
,	_
which	_
to	_
this	_
day	_
has	V.01
never	_
officially	_
said	V.01
that	_
they	_
posses	V.01
nuclear	_
weapons	_
,	_
ranks	V.01
around	_
fifth	_
in	_
nuclear	_
strength	_
.	_

It	_
is	V.03
estimated	V.01
that	_
Israel	_
has	V.03
over	_
200	_
nuclear	_
weapons	_
yet	_
neither	_
the	_
US	_
nor	_
any	_
of	_
her	_
allies	_
expresses	V.01
the	_
slightest	_
concern	V.01
.	_

North	_
Korea	_
’s	_
Kim	_
Jong	_
Ill	_
also	_
has	V.03
the	_
bomb	_
at	_
the	_
top	_
of	_
his	_
list	_
and	_
Santa	_
seems	V.01
to	_
have	V.01
already	_
come	V.01
a	_
few	_
years	_
ago	_
.	_

It	_
is	V.03
rumored	V.01
that	_
North	_
Korea	_
has	V.03
at	_
least	_
a	_
couple	_
nuclear	_
weapons	_
.	_

But	_
getting	V.05
past	_
who	_
should	_
get	V.01
them	_
,	_
is	V.01
who	_
has	V.03
them	_
,	_
and	_
who	_
is	V.01
really	_
close	V.10
.	_

The	_
case	V.03
against	_
Iran	_
has	V.LV
a	_
feeling	V.01
of	_
Déjà	_
vu	_
.	_

somewhat	_
like	_
those	_
of	_
chemical	_

stockpiles	_
in	_

America	_
cried	V.01
wolf	_
in	_
Iraq	_
,	_
and	_
what	_
’s	V.01
scary	V.03
is	V.01
that	_
sooner	_
or	_
later	_
,	_
that	_
wolf	_
will	_
probably	_
get	V.01
us	_
.	_

I	_
ran	V.07
across	_
this	_
item	_
on	_
the	_
Internet	_
.	_

Sooooo	_
.	_

The	_
United	_
States	_
goes	V.02
into	_
a	_
war	_
zone	_
and	_
evacuates	V.01
a	_
bunch	_
of	_
U.S.	_
citizens	_
(	_
most	_
of	_
whom	_
were	V.01
"	_
dual	_
-	_
citizens	_
"	_
)	_
.	_

Then	_
,	_
eschewing	V.01
normal	_
procedure	V.01
,	_
the	_
Department	_
of	_
State	_
waived	V.01
the	_
fees	_
that	_
they	_
charge	V.01
for	_
evacuating	V.01
U.S.	_
citizen	_
.	_

Why	_
?	_

To	_
pander	V.01
to	_
the	_
mythical	_
"	_
Arab	_
street	_
"	_
,	_
of	_
course	_
.	_

Now	_
,	_
I	_
would	_
argue	V.01
that	_
one	_
could	_
have	V.01
reasonably	_
predicted	V.01
that	_
some	_
form	_
of	_
military	_
violence	_
was	V.01
likely	V.01
to	_
occur	V.01
in	_
Lebanon	_
(	_
considering	V.02
that	_
the	_
country	_
has	V.01
been	V.03
experiencing	V.01
some	_
form	_
of	_
conflict	V.01
for	_
approximately	_
the	_
last	_
32	_
years	_
)	_
.	_

In	_
other	_
words	_
,	_
those	_
Americans	_
were	V.01
there	_
by	_
their	_
own	_
choice	V.01
,	_
mired	V.01
in	_
a	_
situation	_
that	_
was	V.01
totally	_
predictable	V.02
.	_

Yet	_
we	_
did	V.01
n't	_
charge	V.01
them	_
for	_
the	_
evacuation	V.01
.	_

This	_
is	V.01
unlike	_
the	_
situation	_
last	_
year	_
in	_
Asia	_
when	_
we	_
evacuated	V.01
U.S.	_
citizens	_
from	_
areas	_
that	_
were	V.03
hit	V.01
by	_
the	_
tsunami	V.01
-	_
a	_
phenomenon	_
that	_
is	V.01
much	_
less	_
predictable	V.02
than	_
the	_
Hezbollah	_
-	_
provoked	_
destruction	V.01
that	_
rained	V.01
down	_
on	_
Lebanon	_
.	_

And	_
what	_
do	V.01
we	_
get	V.01
for	_
this	_
effort	V.01
?	_

A	_
lawsuit	_
.	_

That	_
's	V.01
right	V.06
,	_
folks	_
.	_

The	_
American	_
-	_
Arab	_
Discrimination	_
Committee	_
is	V.03
suing	V.02
Condoleeza	_
Rice	_
and	_
Donald	_
Rumsfeld	_
,	_
charging	V.06
that	_
they	_
mismanaged	V.01
the	_
evacuation	_
efforts	V.01

Dear	_
Nina	_

Here	_
's	V.01
a	_
tip	V.05

Do	V.01
n't	_
get	V.03
married	V.01
in	_
countries	_
that	_
house	V.01
illegal	_
militias	_
that	_
attack	V.01

countries	_
and	_
hence	_
are	V.01
likely	V.01
to	_
come	V.04
under	_
counter-attack	_
!	_

Crap	_
like	_
this	_
sure	_
makes	V.02
me	_
want	V.01
to	_
rush	V.01
right	_
out	_
and	_
rescue	V.01
people	_
from	_
dilemmas	_
of	_
their	_
own	_
making	V.01

Though	_
I	_

quote	V.01

one	_
of	_
the	_

March	_

:	_

I	_
want	V.01
to	_
use	V.01
this	_
opportunity	_
to	_
welcome	V.01
Brian	_
Ryner	_
to	_
Google	_

Brian	_
has	V.01
been	V.01
one	_
of	_
the	_
most	_
crucial	_
elements	_
to	_
the	_
success	V.01

Great	_
to	_

you	_
on	_

Now	_
,	_
none	_
of	_
this	_
has	V.01
been	V.03
confirmed	V.01
by	_
Google	_
at	_
the	_
present	_
time	_
,	_
but	_
it	_
's	V.01
an	_
old	_
adage	_
that	_
you	_
follow	V.01
the	_
money	_
to	_
see	V.01
who	_
is	V.01
behind	_
something	_
.	_

In	_
this	_
case	V.04
,	_
following	V.01
the	_
talent	_
leads	V.03
me	_
to	_
think	V.01
that	_
Google	_
will	_
be	V.03
making	V.LV
an	_
announcement	V.01
this	_
year	_
that	_
formalizes	V.01
the	_
Google	_
-	_
Mozilla	_
/	_
Firefox	_
relationship	V.03
.	_

If	_
you	_
have	V.01
not	_
already	_
seen	V.01
the	_
Flash	_
movie	_

you	_
should	_
take	V.01
a	_
few	_
minutes	_
and	_
view	V.02
the	_
future	_
history	_
of	_

as	_
conceived	V.01

Robin	_
Sloan	_

create	V.01
a	_
brave	_
new	_
world	_
of	_

in	_
2008	_
.	_

This	_
is	V.01
one	_
thought	_
-	_
provoking	_
film	_
.	_

Every	_
move	V.02
Google	_
makes	V.LV
brings	V.01
this	_
particular	_
future	_
closer	_

Just	_
one	_
small	_
commment	_

's	V.01

already	_

take	V.01

this	_
is	V.01
what	_
the	_
whole	_
open	_

thing	_
is	V.01
about	_
.	_

I	_
'm	V.01
inclined	V.01
to	_
say	V.01
that	_
google	_
is	V.03
doing	V.02
what	_
they	_
can	_
to	_
both	_
shape	V.01

support	V.01

growth	_
of	_
the	_
most	_
popular	_
non-Microsoft	_

by	_
taking	V.21

they	_
're	V.03

continued	_
life	_

and	_
ensuring	V.01
(	_
not	_
that	_
I	_
think	V.01
they	_
need	V.01
to	_
)	_
that	_
their	_
voice	V.01
will	_
be	V.03
heard	V.01
admidst	_
the	_
higher	_
echelons	_
of	_
the	_

It	_
's	V.01
this	_
sort	_
of	_
enlightened	_
self	_
interest	V.01
that	_
keeps	V.02
large	_

for	_
the	_

Malach	_
,	_
What	_
you	_
say	V.01
makes	V.LV
sense	V.02
.	_

Acquiring	V.01
open	_
source	_
talent	_
gives	V.01
a	_
company	_
an	_
inexpensive	_
way	V.01
of	_
influencing	V.01
and	_
anticipating	V.01
the	_
direction	_
an	_
open	_
source	_
project	_
will	_
go	V.01
.	_

It	_
probably	_
gives	V.01
more	_
bang	_
for	_
the	_
buck	_
than	_
acquiring	V.01
a	_
private	_
company	_
and	_
having	V.02
to	_
handle	V.01
the	_
inevitable	_
culture	_
clashes	V.01

process	_
mis-matches	_

to	_
be	V.03
seen	V.01
as	_
a	_
form	_
of	_
gross	_
incompetence	_

How	_
did	V.01
the	_
CPA	_
get	V.05
to	_
the	_
point	_
where	_
it	_
has	V.01
turned	V.02
even	_
Iraqi	_
Shiites	_

who	_
were	V.01
initially	_
grateful	V.01
for	_
the	_
removal	V.01
of	_
Saddam	_
Hussein	_

against	_
the	_
United	_

Where	_
it	_
risks	V.01
fighting	V.01
dual	_
Sunni	_
Arab	_
and	_
Shiite	_
insurgencies	_
simultaneously	_

at	_

time	_
when	_
US	_
troops	_
are	V.03
rotating	V.01
on	_
a	_
massive	_
scale	_
and	_
hoping	V.01
to	_
downsize	V.01
their	_
forces	_

the	_

reluctant	V.01
to	_
get	V.03
involved	V.01

One	_
answer	V.01
is	V.01
that	_
the	_
Pentagon	_
prevented	V.01
the	_
State	_
Department	_
from	_
running	V.01

is	V.01
the	_
body	_
with	_
experience	V.01

The	_

Who	_
of	_
Neocons	_
in	_
Iraq	_
helps	V.01
explain	V.01
the	_
extreme	_
incompetence	_
and	_
possibly	_
double	_
-	_
dealing	V.01
of	_

in	_

Commission	_
member	_
Philip	_
Zelikow	_
,	_
who	_
is	V.01
close	V.10
to	_
the	_
Bush	_
administration	V.01
,	_
admitted	V.01
on	_
Sept.	_
10	_
,	_
2002	_
,	_
that	_
the	_
ulterior	_
motive	_
of	_
the	_
Bush	_
administration	V.01
for	_
the	_
Iraq	_
War	_
was	V.01
to	_
"	_
protect	V.01
Israel	_
,	_
"	_
according	_
to	_
the	_
Asian	_
Times	_
.	_

I	_
have	V.01
long	_
been	V.01
a	_
trenchant	_
critic	_
of	_
the	_
Sadrists	_
.	_

But	_
they	_
have	V.01
n't	_
been	V.01
up	_
to	_
anything	_
extraordinary	_
as	_
far	_
as	_
I	_
can	_
see	V.01
in	_
recent	_
weeks	_
.	_

Someone	_
in	_
the	_
CPA	_
sat	V.02
down	_
and	_
thought	V.02
up	_
ways	V.01
to	_
stir	V.02
them	_
up	_
by	_
closing	V.01
their	_
newspaper	_
and	_
issuing	V.01
28	_
arrest	_
warrants	_
and	_
taking	V.06
in	_
people	_
like	_
Yaqubi	_
.	_

This	_
is	V.01
either	_
gross	_
incompetence	_
or	_
was	V.03
done	V.02
with	_
dark	_
ulterior	_
motives	_
that	_
can	_
scarcely	_
be	V.03
guessed	V.01
at	_
.	_

There	_
is	V.02
a	_
classical	_
logical	_
fallacy	_
,	_
post	_
hoc	_
ergo	_
propter	_
hoc	_
(	_
Z	_
happens	V.01
after	_
X	_
,	_
therefore	_
Z	_
is	V.03
caused	V.01
by	_
X	_
)	_
,	_
and	_
I	_
keep	V.02
revising	V.01
this	_
posting	V.01
this	_
evening	_
because	_
I	_
do	V.01
n't	_
want	V.01
to	_
fall	V.10
into	_
it	_
.	_

But	_
sometimes	_
,	_
of	_
course	_
,	_
when	_
Z	_
happens	V.01
after	_
X	_
it	_
is	V.01
because	_
of	_
X	_
.	_

So	_
I	_
may	_
as	_
well	_
just	_
come	V.09
out	_
with	_
it	_
:	_
It	_
is	V.01
pretty	_
suspicious	_
,	_
given	_
the	_
Neocon	_
predominance	_
in	_
the	_
CPA	_
and	_
in	_
the	_
upper	_
reaches	_
of	_
the	_
Defense	_
Department	_
that	_
on	_
April	_

AP	_
reported	V.01
of	_

repeat	V.01
my	_
expression	V.01

Hassan	_

base	_
south	_

did	V.01
comment	V.01

by	_
the	_
phrase	_

And	_
on	_
April	_

his	_
chief	_

leaves	V.13

The	_

unlikely	V.01
to	_
forgive	V.01

forget	V.01

who	_
provoked	V.01
it	_

why	_

I	_
'm	V.01
not	_
even	_
in	_
Iraq	_

I	_
could	_
have	V.01
predicted	V.01
to	_
you	_
the	_
consequences	_
of	_
doing	V.02
what	_
the	_

has	V.01
been	V.03
doing	V.02

Anthony	_

of	_
the	_
Washington	_

reveals	V.01
that	_

definitely	_
could	_

All	_
:	_

It	_
is	V.01
my	_
understanding	V.01
,	_
from	_
good	_
sources	_
in	_
the	_
Gov	_
s	_
office	_
that	_
the	_
Gov	_
will	_
order	V.01
Loretta	_
Lynch	_
to	_
expeditiously	_
implement	V.01
the	_
provision	V.01
to	_
suspend	V.01
all	_
parties	_
auhtority	_
to	_
enter	V.01
into	_
direct	_
access	V.01
contracts	_
.	_

The	_
premise	_
with	_
which	_
the	_
administartion	_
is	V.03
acting	V.02
is	V.01
that	_
if	_
they	_
expeditiously	_
suspend	V.01
everyone	_
's	_
right	V.05
to	_
bilateral	_
contracts	_
quickly	_
,	_
it	_
sets	V.03
up	_
a	_
barrier	_
which	_
the	_
direct	_
access	V.01
coalition	_
must	_
break	V.26
through	_
.	_

In	_
other	_
words	_
the	_
table	_
is	V.03
set	V.14
.	_

Deal	V.02
your	_
meal	_
from	_
where	_
the	_
dishes	_
are	V.03
located	V.01
.	_

I.E.	_
the	_
Davis	_
Administration	V.01
wants	V.01
to	_
place	V.01
all	_
direct	_
access	_
advocates	_
in	_
the	_
position	_
of	_
having	V.02
to	_
justify	V.01
why	_
each	_
and	_
every	_
party	_
should	_
be	V.01
the	_
exception	V.01
to	_
the	_
suspension	V.01
rather	_
than	_
have	V.03
a	_
general	_
rule	V.01
concerning	_
how	_
direct	_
access	V.01
should	_
work	V.09
for	_
all	_
parties	_
.	_

It	_
clearly	_
gives	V.01
the	_
Admin	_
a	_
very	_
strong	_
upper	_
hand	_
to	_
control	V.01
who	_
when	_
and	_
where	_
direct	_
access	V.01
can	_
occur	V.01
without	_
having	V.02
to	_
say	V.01
that	_
they	_
oppose	V.01
direct	_
access	V.01
.	_

Power	_
be	V.01
where	_
power	_
lies	V.07

you	_
are	V.03

going	V.02

I	_
spoke	V.01
to	_
Bruce	_
Garcey	_
at	_
NiMo	_
regarding	_
their	_
RFP	_
.	_

Bruce	_
indicated	V.01
NiMo	_
short	_
listed	V.01
five	_
companies	_
who	_
all	_
bid	V.01
higher	_
than	_
ENA	_
.	_

However	_
,	_
he	_
also	_
mentioned	V.01
we	_
were	V.01
a	_
close	_
sixth	_
,	_
that	_
is	V.01
close	V.10
to	_
the	_
fifth	_
highest	_
bid	V.01
.	_

He	_
gave	V.LV
no	_
indication	V.01
on	_
the	_
value	_
of	_
the	_
highest	_
bid	V.01
.	_

He	_
also	_
said	V.01
that	_
the	_
other	_
five	_
companies	_
making	V.18
the	_
short	_
list	_
all	_
proposed	V.01
alternative	_
structures	_
to	_
the	_
proposed	_
NiMo	_
Tier	_
Structure	_
.	_

NiMo	_
released	V.01
an	_
additional	_
RFP	_
for	_
peaking	V.01
supplies	V.01
for	_
this	_
winter	_
,	_
I	_
believe	V.01
Phil	_
should	_
have	V.03
or	_
be	V.03
getting	V.01
that	_
RFP	_
.	_

Phil	_
if	_
you	_
could	_
please	_
make	V.LV

ASAP	_

Glad	_
to	_
hear	V.01
all	_
is	V.01
well	V.09

I	_
meant	V.02
to	_
comment	V.01
that	_
I	_
thought	V.01
the	_
people	_
profiled	V.01
in	_
the	_
article	_
should	_
pull	V.01
their	_
heads	_
out	_
of	_
their	_
self	_
important	_
asses	_
.	_

It	_
is	V.01
n't	_
about	_
finding	V.01
the	_
meaning	V.01
of	_
life	_
at	_
work	V.01
.	_

It	_
is	V.01
all	_
about	_
the	_
$$$	_
.	_

Work	V.01
hard	_
.	_

Make	V.05
$$$	_
.	_

Retire	V.01
young	V.01

Things	_
with	_
me	_
are	V.01
great	V.01

Moving	_
back	_
to	_
Calgary	_
in	_
about	_
a	_
month	_
which	_
is	V.01
a	_
little	_
sooner	_
than	_
I	_
thought	V.01
I	_
would	_
be	V.03
going	V.02
back	_
but	_
when	_
opportunity	_
knocks	V.01
you	_
got	V.06
ta	_
go	V.02
.	_

Take	V.LV
care	V.03
.	_

I	_
do	V.01
n't	_
hear	V.01
from	_
you	_
in	_
months	_
and	_
then	_
you	_
level	V.03
me	_
with	_
such	_
a	_
thought	_
provoking	_
,	_
soul	_
searching	_
article	_
.	_

Thanks	V.01
for	_
thinking	V.01
of	_
me	_
to	_
send	V.01
it	_
to	_
.	_

I	_
really	_
enjoyed	V.01
reading	V.01
it	_
.	_

We	_
certainly	_
fit	V.01
into	_
certain	_
parts	_
of	_
the	_
article	_
.	_

There	_
are	V.02
a	_
few	_
life	_
theories	_
like	_
that	_
which	_
working	V.06
through	_
.	_

It	_
s	V.01
all	_
interesting	_
stuff	_
.	_

How	_
are	V.03
things	_
going	V.06
with	_
you	_
?	_

Are	V.03
you	_
enjoying	V.01
Houston	_

London	_
has	V.01
been	V.01
great	V.01
.	_

Brokering	V.01
over	_
here	_
has	V.01
been	V.01
pretty	_
rewarding	_
.	_

Traders	_
over	_
here	_
seem	V.01
to	_
have	V.LV
a	_
lot	_
more	_
respect	V.01
for	_
other	_
humans	_
.	_

Catriona	_
is	V.01
well	V.09
and	_
has	V.01
landed	V.02
herself	_
a	_
pretty	_
cool	_

Keep	V.02

I	_
was	V.03
thinking	V.01
of	_
converting	V.01
it	_
to	_
a	_
hover	_
vehicle	_
.	_

I	_
might	_
just	_
sell	V.01
the	_
car	_
and	_
get	V.04
you	_
to	_
drive	V.01
me	_
around	_
all	_
winter	_

How	_
about	_

for	_
the	_

for	_

I	_
am	V.03
going	V.04

You	_
have	V.01
always	_
been	V.01
on	_
the	_
move	V.01
seeking	V.01
affectionate	_
,	_
satisfying	_
and	_
harmonious	_
relationships	V.03
.	_

Your	_
ultimate	_
goal	_
has	V.01
been	V.01
the	_
realisation	V.02
of	_
an	_
intimate	_
union	V.02
in	_
which	_
there	_
could	_
be	V.02
love	V.01
,	_
self	_
-	_
sacrifice	V.01
and	_
mutual	_
trust	_
.	_

It	_
has	V.01
often	_
been	V.03
said	V.01
that	_
"	_
True	_
love	V.01
is	V.01
just	_
around	_
the	_
corner	_
"	_
...	_
and	_
maybe	_
...	_
if	_
you	_
have	V.01
n't	_
found	V.01
it	_
as	_
yet	_
-	_
you	_
possibly	_
soon	_
will	_
.	_

In	_
the	_
past	_
there	_
have	V.01
been	V.02
..	_
and	_
maybe	_
there	_
still	_
are	V.02
many	_
things	_
that	_
you	_
have	V.01
had	V.02
to	_
do	V.02
without	_

You	_

to	_
set	V.01
your	_
sights	V.01
on	_
a	_
position	_
or	_
situation	_
that	_
could	_
give	V.01
you	_
greater	_
prestige	_
and	_
which	_
will	_
afford	V.02
you	_
considerable	_
self	_
esteem	_

You	_
wear	V.01
your	_
heart	_
on	_
your	_

since	_
you	_

...	_
to	_
all	_
those	_
that	_
show	V.01
you	_
a	_
little	_
affection	V.01

but	_
take	V.LV
care	V.03
...	_
it	_
would	_
appear	V.02
that	_
you	_
have	V.01
been	V.03
extremely	_
hurt	V.01
in	_
the	_
past	_
...	_
and	_
you	_
keep	V.02
leaving	V.12
yourself	_
wide	_

punishment	V.01

Whatever	_
you	_

something	_

develop	V.02

Dear	_
All	_
,	_

My	_
mane	_
is	V.01
Visit	_
Phunnarungsi	_
.	_

I	_
used	V.03
to	_
e-mail	V.01
Vince	_
Kaminski	_
about	_
the	_
advice	_
on	_
his	_
article	_
"	_
The	_
Challenge	_
of	_
Pricing	V.01
and	_
Risk	_
Managing	V.01
Electricity	_
Derivatives	_
"	_
and	_
he	_
had	V.01
mailed	V.01
me	_
the	_
copy	V.01
.	_

I	_
am	V.03
now	_
modelling	V.01
the	_
Queensland	_
electricity	_
spot	_
price	V.01
using	V.01
Geometric	_
Brownian	_
Mean	_
Reverting	V.01
Jump	_
Diffusion	V.01
Model	V.01
and	_
have	V.01
followed	V.02
your	_
paper	_
"	_
Making	V.01
the	_
most	_
of	_
mean	_
reversion	_
"	_
to	_
estimate	V.01
the	_
mean	_
reversion	V.01
speed	_
.	_

I	_
use	V.01
Queensland	_
half	_
-	_
hourly	_
price	V.01
during	_
13	_
December	_
,	_
1998	_
-	_
30	_
June	_
2001	_
giving	V.01
about	_
44,000	_
price	_
observations	V.02
.	_

However	_
,	_
the	_
result	_
from	_
Ordinary	_
Least	_
Squares	_
was	V.01
not	_
as	_
expected	V.01
due	_
to	_
different	_
sign	V.07
for	_
both	_
slope	_
&	_
intercept	_
.	_

The	_
coefficient	_
and	_
standard	_
error	V.01
are	V.01
as	_
followed	V.04
:	_

Intercept	_
:	_
-	_
0.3931	_
(	_
0.0076	_
)	_

Slope	_
:	_
0.1171	_
(	_
0.0022	_
)	_

R	_
Square	_
:	_
0.0585	_

Therefore	_
I	_
could	_
not	_
estimate	V.01
the	_
mean	_
reversion	V.01
rate	_
as	_
the	_
estimated	_
slope	_
has	V.03
the	_
positive	_
sign	V.07
.	_

I	_
have	V.01
also	_
tried	V.01
monthly	_
data	_
and	_
the	_
results	_
are	V.01
the	_
same	_
.	_

It	_
would	_
be	V.03
appreciated	V.02
if	_
you	_
could	_
advice	V.01
me	_
on	_
this	_
matter	_

our	_

will	_
be	V.03
making	V.LV
those	_
decisions	V.01
after	_
the	_
first	_
of	_
the	_
year	_

Until	_
we	_
have	V.01
come	V.11
up	_
with	_
those	_
numbers	_
it	_
would	_
be	V.01
premature	V.01
to	_
make	V.LV
any	_
offers	V.01
for	_
the	_
summer	_

What	_
I	_
would	_
like	V.02
to	_
do	V.02
in	_
this	_
case	_
is	V.01
get	V.01
the	_
information	_
to	_
Jeff	_
Davis	_
,	_
who	_
is	V.01
responsible	V.03
for	_
Georgia	_
Tech	_
and	_
ask	V.02
him	_
to	_
get	V.01
Sungjoo	_
's	_
resume	_
and	_
start	V.01
a	_
file	_
on	_
him	_
with	_
a	_
notation	V.01
that	_
you	_
would	_
like	V.02
to	_
hire	V.01
him	_
for	_
summer	_
.	_

When	_
we	_
start	V.01
the	_
summer	_
process	V.02
,	_
we	_
will	_
interview	V.01
the	_
candidate	_
and	_
slot	_
him	_
for	_
your	_
group	_
.	_

Is	V.01
this	_
okay	_
with	_
you	_
?	_

Hope	V.01
all	_
is	V.01
well	V.09

you	_

Again	_

it	_
was	V.01
a	_
good	_
chance	V.02
for	_
me	_
to	_
get	V.22

know	V.01
what	_
I	_
can	_
do	V.02
in	_
this	_
field	_
and	_
what	_
I	_
have	V.02
to	_
more	_
focus	V.01
on	_
in	_
school	_
.	_

I	_
am	V.03
looking	V.03
forward	_
to	_
hearing	V.01
from	_
you	_

me	_

the	_

pay	V.01
something	_
in	_

a	_

the	_

It	_

removed	V.01

also	_
under	_
the	_
close	_
affliction	V.01
of	_

I	_
was	V.01
ashamed	_

friendship	_
with	_
girls	_
...	_
until	_
I	_
undrstood	V.01
that	_

's	V.01
not	_

as	_
well	_
as	_
women	_
wearing	V.01

:)	_

Now	_

Article	_

Frequent	_
travelers	_
and	_
executives	_
are	V.01
among	_
the	_
masses	_
that	_
get	V.01
a	_
lot	_
of	_
discount	V.01
in	_
the	_
airfare	_
.	_

It	_
is	V.01
easy	V.05
to	_
get	V.01
discount	_
airfare	_
for	_
them	_
since	_
they	_
travel	V.01
very	_
frequently	_
.	_

Cheap	_
air	_
tickets	_
for	_
Corporate	_

Some	_
of	_
the	_
corporate	_
also	_
get	V.01
cheap	_
air	_
tickets	_
because	_
they	_
tie	V.05
up	_
with	_
some	_
of	_
the	_
airlines	_
for	_
a	_
certain	_
period	_
based	_
on	_
the	_
discount	V.01
and	_
services	V.01
they	_
get	V.01
from	_
the	_
airlines	_
.	_

Corporate	_
plans	V.01
are	V.03
clubbed	V.01
with	_
other	_
services	V.01
through	_
some	_
agencies	_
to	_
provide	V.01
better	_
service	V.01
for	_
their	_
staff	_
.	_

Promotional	_
discount	_
airfare	_

Some	_
countries	_
like	_
Malaysia	_
and	_
Singapore	_
promote	V.02
trading	V.01
for	_
foreign	_
visitors	_
during	_
some	_
part	_
of	_

During	_
this	_
period	_

their	_
country	_
on	_
certain	_

If	_

COMPLETE	_
ARTICLE	_
AT	_

http://discountairlineticket.blogspot.com/2005/10/some-techniques-to-...	_

Several	_
years	_
ago	_
I	_
developed	V.02
a	_
short	_
paper	_
and	_
pencil	_
screening	_
test	V.01
which	_
,	_
in	_
a	_
small	_
pilot	_
study	V.01
,	_
discriminated	V.01
between	_
ADHD	_
,	_
LD	_
,	_
and	_
control	_
subjects	_
.	_

I	_
recently	_
converted	V.01
this	_
test	V.01
to	_
an	_
online	_
test	V.01
in	_
order	_
to	_
norm	V.01
it	_
to	_
a	_
larger	_
population	V.01
and	_
,	_
subsequently	_
,	_
to	_
make	V.02
it	_
available	V.02
to	_
any	_
one	_
who	_
has	V.03
access	V.01
to	_
a	_
computer	_
and	_
the	_
Internet	_
.	_

The	_
test	V.01
itself	_
is	V.01
what	_
is	V.03
called	V.01
a	_
substitution	_
test	V.01
.	_

It	_
has	V.03
two	_
parts	_
,	_
both	_
of	_
which	_
are	V.03
timed	V.01
for	_
90	_
seconds	_
each	_
and	_
the	_
differential	_
between	_
the	_
resulting	V.01
two	_
scores	V.01
determines	V.01
the	_
likelihood	_
of	_
having	V.03
a	_
learning	_
disability	_
or	_
attention	_
deficit	_
disorder	_
.	_

I	_
am	V.01
in	_
need	V.01
of	_
test	_
subjects	_
and	_
hope	V.01
you	_
will	_
take	V.01
it	_
.	_

The	_
test	V.01
,	_
along	_
with	_
an	_
information	_
form	_
,	_
is	V.01
available	V.02
at	_
:	_
.	_

I	_
think	V.01
a	_
test	V.01
like	_
this	_
one	_
is	V.03
much	_
needed	V.01
.	_

A	_
person	_
can	_
take	V.01
it	_
directly	_
instead	_
of	_
others	_
completing	V.01
behavioral	_
checklists	_
or	_
a	_
completing	V.01
a	_
lengthy	_
program	_
intensive	_
test	V.01
like	_
TOVA	_
.	_

Perhaps	_
you	_
are	V.01
willing	V.02
to	_
recommend	V.01
this	_
site	_
and	_
,	_
if	_
you	_
have	V.03
a	_
website	_
,	_
place	V.01
a	_

on	_
your	_
website	_

are	V.02
there	_
any	_
sadists	_
out	_
there	_
who	_
share	V.01
the	_
same	_
tastes	V.01
as	_
i	_
do	V.01
?	_

i	_
do	V.01
nt	_
know	V.01
what	_
it	_
is	V.01
,	_
but	_
since	_
a	_
very	_
young	_
age	_
i	_
have	V.01
had	V.LV
a	_
strange	_
but	_
very	_
gratifying	_
urge	V.01
to	_
torture	V.01
or	_
maime	V.01
animals	_
.	_

i	_
am	V.01
deadly	_
serious	V.01
,	_
i	_
really	_
do	V.01
get	V.01
sexual	_
releif	_
from	_
even	_
hearing	V.01
of	_
torture	V.01
of	_
animals	_
,	_
now	_
some	_
people	_
may	_
call	V.01
me	_
a	_
brute	_
or	_
a	_
coward	_
but	_
i	_
ca	_
nt	_
help	V.02
my	_
true	_
feelings	V.01
.	_

badger	_
baiting	V.02
is	V.01
natrually	_
a	_
huge	_
turn	V.13
on	_
,	_
so	_
i	_
thought	V.01
a	_
few	_
words	_
in	_
this	_
group	_
might	_
uncover	V.01
some	_
mutual	_
enthusiasts	_
.	_

sincere	_
appologies	_
to	_
anyone	_
who	_
is	V.03
offended	V.01
by	_
my	_
request	V.01
but	_
my	_
request	V.01
is	V.01
genuine	V.01

Once	_
upon	_
a	_
time	_
(	_
in	_
2001	_
,	_
to	_
be	V.01
specific	_
)	_
,	_
the	_
Coca	_
-	_
Cola	_
corporation	_
built	V.01
a	_
bottling	_
plant	_
in	_
a	_
small	_
and	_
remote	_
Indian	_
village	_
in	_
the	_
state	_
of	_
Kerala	_
.	_

In	_
exchange	V.01
for	_
sucking	V.01
vast	_
amounts	_
of	_
water	_
out	_
of	_
the	_
local	_
land	_
,	_
the	_
mighty	_
corporation	_
promised	V.01
to	_
bring	V.01
the	_
people	_
great	_
wealth	_
.	_

But	_
within	_
a	_
few	_
short	_
months	_
,	_
the	_
village	_
people	_
began	V.02
to	_
notice	V.01
their	_
wells	_
were	V.03
running	V.01
dry	_
,	_
so	_
they	_
complained	V.01
to	_
the	_
corporation	_
.	_

Coca	_
-	_
Cola	_
calmed	V.01
the	_
concerns	V.01
of	_
the	_
people	_
and	_
attempted	V.01
to	_
win	V.01
back	_
their	_
favor	_
by	_
giving	V.01
them	_
vast	_
amounts	_
of	_
free	_
fertilizer	_
,	_
saying	V.01
it	_
would	_
grow	V.03
bountiful	_
crops	_
beyond	_
their	_
wildest	_
dreams	V.01
.	_

After	_
several	_
years	_
of	_
use	V.01
,	_
we	_
arrive	V.01
at	_
the	_
present	_
day	_
when	_
the	_
village	_
people	_
have	V.01
suddenly	_
discovered	V.01
the	_
fertilizer	_
is	V.01
actually	_
the	_
bottling	_
plant	_
's	_
waste	_
sludge	_
and	_
is	V.01
laden	_
with	_
cadmium	_
,	_
a	_
highly	_
toxic	_
,	_
cancer	_
-	_
causing	_
heavy	_
metal	_
.	_

The	_
village	_
soil	_
and	_
water	_
are	V.03
now	_
too	_
heavily	_
contaminated	V.01
to	_
safely	_
occupy	V.01
human	_
life	_
,	_
so	_
the	_
plant	_
was	V.03
shut	V.05
down	_
last	_
week	_
.	_

Moral	_
of	_
the	_
story	_
:	_
Do	V.01
n't	_
drink	V.01
Coke	_
..........	_
drink	V.01
Pepsi	_

Just	_
kidding	V.01
,	_
Pepsi	_
is	V.01
actually	_
in	_
the	_
process	V.02
of	_
being	V.03
thrown	V.01
out	_
of	_

for	_
similar	_

because	_
those	_

Therefore	_

to	_
secure	V.02

Having	V.01
personally	_
visited	V.01
the	_
West	_
Bank	_
and	_
Israel	_
,	_
I	_
can	_
say	V.01
that	_
this	_
new	_
political	_
voice	V.01
is	V.03
threatening	V.01
to	_
collapse	V.01
the	_
peace	_
process	V.02

If	_
Abbas	_
does	V.01
not	_
change	V.01
his	_
former	_
thinking	V.01
and	_
continues	V.01
the	_
path	_
of	_
Yasser	_

then	_
there	_
will	_
not	_
be	V.02
peace	V.01

The	_
Palestinian	_
militant	_
organisation	_
Hamas	_
has	V.01
announced	V.01
an	_
end	V.01
to	_
rocket	_
attacks	V.01
on	_
Israel	_
from	_
the	_
Gaza	_
Strip	_
after	_
a	_
weekend	_
of	_
escalating	_
violence	_
.	_

Up	_
to	_
40	_
rockets	_
had	V.01
been	V.03
fired	V.01
at	_
Israel	_
,	_
weeks	_
after	_
its	_
military	_
withdrew	V.01
from	_
the	_
territory	_
.	_

In	_
response	V.01
to	_
the	_
rockets	_
,	_
Israel	_
resumed	V.01
its	_
policy	_
of	_
targeting	V.01
militant	_
leaders	_
in	_
air	_
strikes	V.01
.	_

Authorised	V.01
by	_
Ariel	_
Sharon	_
to	_
make	V.LV
"	_
unrestricted	_
"	_
strikes	V.01
,	_
its	_
military	_
launched	V.01
new	_
missile	_
attacks	V.01
overnight	_
.	_

It	_
looks	V.02
as	_
if	_
Hamas	_
has	V.01
thrown	V.01
in	_
the	_
towel	_
for	_
this	_
round	V.05
,	_
unable	V.01
to	_
take	V.LV
the	_
beating	V.01
the	_
Israeli	_
Defense	_
Forces	_
have	V.01
unleashed	V.01
upon	_
this	_
terrorist	_
group	_
.	_

Mahmoud	_
Zahar	_
,	_
Hamas	_
's	_
leader	_
declared	V.01
the	_
cease	_
fire	V.01
after	_
Israel	_
killed	V.01
it's	_
former	_
leader	_
,	_
Muhammed	_
Sheikh	_
Khalil	_
.	_

Hamas	_
has	V.01
become	V.01
rather	_
unpopular	_
in	_
Gaza	_
,	_
as	_
many	_
see	V.01
the	_
Israeli	_
air	_
strikes	V.01
as	_
a	_
response	V.01
towards	_
the	_
rocket	_
attacks	V.01
upon	_
Israeli	_
soil	_
.	_

Egypt	_
had	V.03
a	_
role	_
to	_
play	V.02
as	_
they	_
convinced	V.01
Hamas	_
to	_
end	V.01
the	_
attacks	V.01
,	_
although	_
the	_
same	_
can	_
not	_
be	V.03
said	V.01
of	_
Islamic	_
Jihad	_
.	_

(	_
Jerusalem	_
Post	_
)	_

"	_
We	_
're	V.01
not	_
happy	V.01
with	_
Hamas	_
's	_
position	_
at	_
this	_
stage	_
and	_
in	_
light	_
of	_
the	_
Israeli	_
escalation	V.01
against	_
the	_
Palestinians	_
,	_
"	_
commented	V.01
Khader	_
Habib	_
,	_
a	_
senior	_
Islamic	_
Jihad	_
official	_
.	_

"	_
But	_
it	_
seems	V.01
that	_
Hamas	_
has	V.03
its	_
own	_
political	_
agenda	_
.	_
"	_

[	_
...	_
]	_

"	_
The	_
problem	_
is	V.01
not	_
with	_
the	_
Palestinian	_
resistance	_
groups	_
but	_
with	_
Israel	_
's	_
scheme	_
to	_
destroy	V.01
the	_
Palestinians	_
'	_
infrastructure	_
,	_
"	_
Habib	_
said	V.01
.	_

"	_
Hamas	_
remains	V.01
targeted	V.01
by	_
Israel	_
,	_
as	_
in	_
the	_
past	_
,	_
and	_
the	_
Israeli	_
occupation	V.01
does	V.01
not	_
need	V.01
excuses	V.02
to	_
pursue	V.01
its	_
aggression	V.01
.	_

Israel	_
wants	V.01
to	_
drive	V.02
the	_
Palestinians	_
toward	_
civil	_
war	V.01
.	_
"	_

Islamic	_
Jihad	_
has	V.01
refused	V.01
to	_
recognized	V.02
the	_
cease	_
fire	V.01
,	_
and	_
hopes	V.01
to	_
turn	V.02
the	_
Gaza	_
strip	_
"	_
into	_
a	_
vast	_
battlefield	_
.	_
"	_

Unless	_
President	_
Mahmoud	_
Abbas	_
steps	V.02
in	_
,	_
Gaza	_
will	_
probably	_
look	V.02
like	_
a	_
battle	_
field	_
by	_
the	_
time	_
Israel	_
is	V.01
done	V.08
reminding	V.01
Hamas	_
of	_
their	_
critical	_
error	V.01
,	_
although	_
currently	_
the	_
only	_
thing	_
Abbas	_
is	V.03
doing	V.02
is	V.01
lashing	V.02
out	_
and	_
refusing	V.01
to	_
take	V.01
responsibility	_
for	_
his	_
inability	_
to	_
act	V.02

but	_
I	_
ca	_
n't	_
risk	V.01
losing	V.02
the	_
job	_
because	_
I	_
have	V.03

ask	V.01
♥	_

I	_
do	V.01
n't	_
think	V.01
they	_
ban	V.01
if	_
the	_
tats	_
are	V.01
n't	_
offensive	V.01
and	_
you	_
should	_
make	V.02
them	_
not	_
noticeable	V.02
at	_
the	_
time	_
of	_
the	_
interview	V.01

once	_
you	_
got	V.01
the	_
job	_
there	_
nothing	_
they	_
can	_
really	_
say	V.01

it	_
s	V.01
a	_
ammazing	_
and	_
is	V.01
by	_
the	_

People	_
are	V.01
open	V.01

thr	_
since	_
the	_

frequented	V.01

I	_
have	V.03
a	_

and	_
there	_
are	V.02
2	_
eggs	_
in	_
the	_

will	_
they	_
hatch	V.01

not	_
,	_
if	_
there	_
is	V.02
not	_
a	_
bird	_
sitting	V.01
on	_
the	_
eggs	_

This	_
is	V.01

.	_

Cockatiels	_
can	_
lay	V.01
unfertilized	_
eggs	_

Just	_
because	_
you	_
have	V.03
a	_

it	_
can	_
not	_
be	V.03

You	_
can	_
try	V.01
picking	V.04
up	_
the	_
eggs	_
and	_
holding	V.01
it	_
up	_
against	_
a	_
very	_
bright	_
light	_
.	_

If	_
you	_
see	V.01
a	_
dark	_
spot	_
in	_
the	_
egg	_
,	_
that	_
means	V.01
it	_
is	V.01
fertilized	_

will	_
hatch	V.01

What	_

you	_

If	_

a	_
cat	_

My	_
cat	_
s	_
name	_
is	V.01
Twinky	_

When	_
she	_
was	V.01
a	_
tiny	_
little	_
kitten	_
she	_
looked	V.02
like	_
those	_
twinky	_
snack	_
cakes	_

She	_
is	V.01
a	_
creme	_
tabby	_
and	_
I	_
've	V.01
had	V.03
her	_
for	_
over	_
2	_
years	_
now	_
.	_

I	_
have	V.01
a	_
siamese	_
lynx	_
name	V.01
Star	_
we	_
called	V.01
her	_
that	_
because	_
she	_
has	V.03
a	_
star	_
pattern	_
on	_
her	_
face	_
.	_

And	_
she	_
is	V.01
the	_
STAR	_
of	_
the	_
family	_

I	_
love	V.01
her	_

:)	_

I	_
have	V.03
a	_
Norwegian	_
Forest	_
Cat	_
that	_
is	V.03
named	V.01
Achilles	_
bc	_
as	_
a	_
kitten	_
he	_
always	_
attacked	V.01
your	_
feet	_
when	_
you	_
walked	V.01
by	_
!	_

My	_
cat	_
s	V.03
Called	V.01
Frank	_
because	_
the	_
year	_
we	_
got	V.01
him	_
was	V.01
the	_
year	_
Frank	_
Sinatra	_
died	V.01

He	_
also	_
had	V.03
bright	_
blue	_

like	_
Frank	_

did	V.02

what	_
does	V.01
it	_
mean	V.01
when	_
a	_
veiled	_
chameleon	_
egg	_
is	V.01
soft	V.02
?	_

my	_
female	_
chameleon	_
just	_
laid	V.01
eggs	_
yesterday	_
and	_
today	_
some	_
of	_
the	_
eggs	_
are	V.01
soft	V.02
when	_
i	_
mean	V.01
soft	_
i	_
mean	V.01
like	_
not	_
like	_
ordinary	_
chameleon	_
eggs	_
.	_

They	_
are	V.01
probably	_
infertile	_
.	_

If	_
there	_
is	V.02
no	_
male	_
they	_
are	V.01
probably	_
infertile	_
!	_

If	_
you	_
take	V.01
a	_
flash	_
light	_
and	_
shine	V.01
it	_
through	_
the	_
eggs	_
and	_
you	_
see	V.01
nothing	_
throw	V.07
them	_
away	_
!	_

If	_
you	_
do	V.01
not	_
they	_
will	_
start	V.01
to	_
rot	V.01
!	_

If	_
she	_
has	V.03
no	_
male	_
to	_
fertilize	V.01
the	_
eggs	_
,	_
the	_
eggs	_
will	_
aways	_
be	V.01
infertile	_
.	_

if	_
you	_
do	V.01
have	V.03
a	_
male	_
but	_
they	_
are	V.01
not	_
in	_
the	_
same	_
cage	_
or	_
breeding	V.01
but	_
you	_
touch	V.01
him	_
then	_
her	_
she	_
will	_
smell	V.01
his	_
sent	_
and	_
probably	_
lay	V.01
eggs	_
.	_

Hope	V.01
she	_
stops	V.01
laying	V.01
eggs	_
because	_
she	_
will	_
get	V.03
really	_
skinny	_
!	_

If	_
she	_
continues	V.01
!	_

Hope	V.01
this	_
helps	V.01

It	_

an	_
amazing	_
experience	V.01

Is	V.01
it	_
better	V.02
to	_
book	V.03
a	_
cruise	_
online	_
or	_
by	_
a	_
travel	_
agent	_
?	_

First	_
time	_
to	_
go	V.02
on	_
A	_
cruise	_
any	_
and	_
all	_
info	_
is	V.03
appreciated	V.02

Personally	_
,	_
I	_
do	V.01
n't	_
find	V.02
a	_
travel	_
agent	_
to	_
be	V.01
of	_
value	_
to	_
me	_
as	_
I	_
am	V.01
willing	V.02
to	_
put	V.05
in	_
the	_
time	_
doing	V.LV
research	V.01
on	_
the	_
internet	_
.	_

I	_
have	V.01
not	_
had	V.LV
good	_
experience	V.01
with	_
travel	_
agents	_
.	_

They	_
do	V.01
n't	_
seem	V.01
to	_
know	V.01
anything	_
but	_
the	_
hype	_
they	_
are	V.03
told	V.01
and	_
the	_
packages	_
they	_
have	V.03
available	V.02
to	_
them	_
.	_

The	_
one	_
time	_
I	_
actually	_
booked	V.03
through	_
a	_
travel	_
agent	_
I	_
did	V.01
not	_
get	V.01
all	_
of	_
the	_
amenities	_
I	_
had	V.01
paid	V.01
for	_
.	_

The	_
few	_
times	_
I	_
have	V.01
consulted	V.01
with	_
a	_
travel	_
agent	_
I	_
was	V.01
able	V.01
to	_
find	V.01
the	_
same	_
for	_
less	_
on	_
my	_
own	_
,	_
and	_
more	_
options	_
than	_
what	_
they	_
were	V.03
selling	V.01
.	_

So	_
now	_
I	_
do	V.01
not	_
bother	V.02
with	_
them	_
at	_
all	_
.	_

best	_
is	V.01
using	V.01

I	_
'm	V.03
not	_
kidding	V.01
,	_
I	_
once	_
lost	V.02
a	_
hamster	_
in	_
my	_
house	_
3	_
months	_
later	_
I	_
walk	V.01
down	_
in	_
the	_
basement	_
and	_
it	_
was	V.01
as	_
big	V.01
as	_
a	_
rat	_
.	_

It	_
had	V.01
been	V.03
eating	V.01
dog	_
food	_
the	_
whole	_
time	_
.	_

It	_
was	V.01
huge	V.01
and	_
scared	V.01
the	_
crap	_
out	_
of	_
me	_
.	_

Make	V.02
sure	V.01
he	_
is	V.01
n't	_
trapped	V.01
somewhere	_
&	_
put	V.01
a	_
bowl	_
of	_
food	_
out	_

He	_
will	_
come	V.01
and	_
eat	V.01

Start	V.01
cleaning	V.01
and	_
start	V.01
looking	V.01

can	_
i	_
have	V.03
some	_
indoor	_
pet	_
ideas	_
please	_
!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	_

i	_
want	V.01
a	_
small	_
indoor	_
pet	_
that	_
my	_
mother	_
will	_
let	V.01
me	_
have	V.03
please	_
help	V.01

i	_
want	V.01
something	_
cheap	_
east	_
to	_
take	V.LV
care	V.03
of	_
and	_
something	_
to	_
hopefully	_
fit	V.01
in	_
my	_
room	_

no	_
pet	_
is	V.01
really	_
easy	V.05
to	_
take	V.LV
care	V.03
of	_
.	_

they	_
all	_
need	V.01
love	V.01
and	_
attn	_
,	_
food	_
,	_
proper	_
surroundings	_
etc	_
.	_

the	_
easiest	_
thing	_
would	_
be	V.01
a	_
fish	_
-	_
but	_
u	_
need	V.01
to	_
clean	V.01
the	_
tank	_
weekly	_
,	_
feed	V.01
it	_
the	_
right	_
amt	_
,	_
etc	_
etc	_
x	_

Having	V.03
a	_
pet	_
is	V.01
n't	_
easy	V.05
.	_

You	_
should	_
treat	V.01
all	_
pets	_
like	_
children	_
.	_

They	_
require	V.01
a	_
lot	_
of	_
attention	V.02
or	_
they	_
get	V.03
fussy	_
and	_
tear	V.04
stuff	_
up	_
.	_

If	_
you	_
want	V.01
easy	_
then	_
go	V.03
with	_
a	_
gold	_
fish	_
or	_
hamster	_
.	_

I	_
would	_
go	V.03
with	_
a	_
small	_
rodent	_
such	_
as	_
a	_
mouse	_
,	_
rat	_
,	_
hamster	_
or	_
gerbil	_
if	_
you	_
want	V.01
something	_
you	_
can	_
handle	V.01
and	_
hold	V.01
.	_

Fish	_
are	V.01
probably	_
the	_
easiest	_
to	_
take	V.LV
care	V.03
of	_

sensuality	_
?	_

I	_
ve	V.01
been	V.03
dating	V.02
a	_
man	_
from	_
brittany	_
france	_
for	_
a	_
couple	_
of	_
months	_
now	_
.	_

He	_
's	V.03
been	V.01
away	_
for	_
a	_
week	_
and	_
I	_
was	V.03
thinking	V.01
of	_
waiting	V.01
for	_
him	_
in	_
his	_
apartment	_
wearing	V.01
only	_
his	_
dress	_
shirt	_
.	_

It	_
s	V.01
still	_
a	_
fairly	_
new	_
relationship	V.03
and	_
we	_
have	V.01
nt	_
had	V.LV
sex	V.01
yet	_
so	_
it	_
s	V.01
kind	_
of	_
a	_
big	_
deal	V.03
.	_

I	_
just	_
do	V.01
nt	_
want	V.01
to	_
freak	V.02
him	_
out	_
or	_
make	V.02
him	_
feel	V.01
uncomfortable	V.01
.	_

Is	V.01
it	_
ok	_
for	_
a	_
woman	_
in	_
french	_
culture	_
to	_
make	V.LV
the	_
first	_
move	V.02
?	_

What	_
do	V.01
french	_
men	_
find	V.02
sexy	_
?	_

French	_
women	_
are	V.01
the	_
ones	_
to	_
say	V.01
yes	_
,	_
the	_
way	V.01
we	_
say	V.01
it	_
is	V.01
not	_
usually	_
as	_
straigthforward	_
as	_
you	_
propose	V.01
to	_
do	V.01
.	_

Why	_
not	_
wait	V.01
for	_
him	_
in	_
a	_
sexy	_
dress	_
with	_
lunch	_
or	_
dinner	_
,	_
or	_
a	_
light	_
snack	_
at	_
his	_
house	_
.	_

And	_
you	_
take	V.01
it	_
up	_
from	_
there	_
.	_

Just	_
make	V.02
sure	V.01
that	_
it	_

IN	_
LOVE	V.01

IS	V.01
THE	_
BEST	_
OF	_
THE	_
BEST	_

If	_
you	_
want	V.01
cheaply	_
made	_
glass	_
from	_
India	_
and	_
China	_
,	_
this	_
is	V.01
not	_
your	_
place	_
.	_

These	_
people	_
only	_
carry	V.01
the	_
very	_
best	_
American	_
blown	_
glass	_
.	_

Their	_
selection	V.01
is	V.01
top	_
notch	_
and	_
the	_
staff	_
is	V.01
very	_
knowledgable	_
.	_

Go	V.02
to	_
the	_
Looking	_
Glass	_
for	_
all	_
your	_
smoking	_
needs	V.01
!!!!!!!!!!	_

Chuck	_
and	_
Gretchen	_
were	V.01
very	_
positive	V.02
,	_
and	_
when	_
Alan	_
's	_
refused	V.01
to	_
work	V.01
on	_
my	_
bike	_
,	_
Chuck	_
came	V.01
right	_
out	_
and	_
saw	V.01
the	_
problem	_
and	_
did	V.02
what	_
Alan	_
's	_
mechanic	_
would	_
n't	_
do	V.02
.	_

He	_
worked	V.01
on	_
it	_
right	_
on	_
the	_
back	_
of	_
my	_
car	_
.	_

I	_
am	V.01
extremely	_
pleased	V.01

Quick	_
and	_
Cheap	_

Walked	V.01
in	_
and	_
was	V.01
out	_
ta	_
there	_
in	_
10	_
mins	_
with	_
a	_
really	_
good	_
deal	V.01
i	_
thought	V.01
i	_
was	V.03
going	V.04
to	_
be	V.03
paying	V.01
a	_
lot	_
because	_
i	_
had	V.03
a	_
DUI	_
but	_
with	_
my	_
DUI	_
and	_
Sr	_
-	_
22	_
they	_
were	V.01
able	V.01
to	_
get	V.01
me	_
the	_
best	_
deal	V.01
out	_
there	_
.	_

Is	V.01
not	_
a	_
service	_
office	_

This	_
is	V.01
a	_
delivery	_
office	_
only	_
and	_
does	V.01
not	_
take	V.01
walk	_
ins	_
but	_
they	_
do	V.01
have	V.03
a	_
blue	_
box	_
out	_
front	_
.	_

Glad	_
I	_
called	V.02
before	_
I	_
arrived	V.01
with	_
my	_
box	_
to	_
ship	V.01
.	_

Thought	V.01
adding	V.02
a	_
comment	V.01
would	_
save	V.01
someone	_
the	_
hassle	V.02
with	_
a	_
useless	_
trip	V.03
there	_
.	_

the	_
food	_
is	V.01
mediocre	_
at	_
best	_
.	_

the	_
waitress	_
took	V.01
my	_
name	_
and	_
then	_
called	V.01
me	_
that	_
all	_
night	_
.	_

not	_
sure	_
how	_
I	_
feel	V.01
about	_
that	_
one	_
.	_

it	_
's	V.01
passable	_
as	_
a	_
pub	_
,	_
but	_
the	_
pizza	_
is	V.01
not	_
that	_
great	V.01
.	_

if	_
you	_
want	V.01
good	_
pizza	_
,	_
go	V.02
to	_
famoso	_
.	_

seriously	_
.	_

Anyone	_
else	_
find	V.02
it	_
a	_
little	_
suspicious	_
that	_
there	_
are	V.02
not	_
only	_
20	_
reviews	V.01
for	_
this	_
dentist	_
(	_
a	_
HUGE	_
number	_
compared	_
to	_
the	_
others	_
in	_
the	_
area	_
)	_
,	_
but	_
that	_
they	_
all	_
have	V.03
the	_
same	_
unique	_
grammar	_
structure	_
?	_

And	_
they	_
seem	V.01
to	_
be	V.03
posted	V.01
at	_
fairly	_
regular	_
intervals	_
?	_

Best	_
YET	_
!	_

We	_
go	V.02
to	_
Japaneiro	_
's	_
all	_
the	_
time	_
and	_

NEVER	_

Harlan	_
provides	V.01
great	_
service	V.01
.	_

He	_
is	V.01
very	_
knowledgeable	V.01
and	_
took	V.01
the	_
time	_
to	_
explain	V.01
the	_
repairs	V.01
to	_
me	_
.	_

The	_
work	V.01
on	_
my	_
car	_
was	V.03
done	V.08
quickly	_
and	_
I	_
felt	V.02
I	_
could	_
trust	V.02
his	_
work	V.01
.	_

I	_
have	V.03
nothing	_
but	_
fantastic	_
things	_
to	_
say	V.01
.	_

I	_
highly	_
recommend	V.01
his	_
shop	_
.	_

Best	_
in	_
Memphis	_

This	_
shop	_
is	V.01
by	_
far	_
the	_
best	_
I	_
have	V.01
been	V.01
to	_
.	_

I	_
have	V.03
a	_
Saab	_
...	_
which	_
everything	_
is	V.01
expensive	V.02
on	_
and	_
they	_
have	V.01
been	V.01
extrememly	_
fair	V.01
and	_
price	V.01
a	_
lot	_
lower	_
than	_
any	_
other	_
shop	_
I	_
called	V.02
.	_

They	_
are	V.01
the	_
only	_
place	_
I	_
would	_
take	V.01
my	_
car	_
peiod	_
.	_

Took	V.01
a	_
laptop	_
in	_
for	_
a	_
video	_
cable	_
to	_
be	V.03
replaced	V.01
.	_

Everything	_
except	_
the	_
display	_
worked	V.09
fine	_
before	_
I	_
took	V.01
it	_
in	_
.	_

The	_
video	_
cable	_
was	V.03
replaced	V.01
and	_
suddenly	_
the	_
motherboard	_
was	V.01
dead	_
.	_

Phone	_
calls	V.02
were	V.03
n't	_
returned	V.02
when	_
promised	V.01
and	_
the	_
botched	V.01
repair	V.01
took	V.10
a	_
week	_
longer	_
than	_
promised	V.01
.	_

We	_
have	V.01
stayed	V.01
at	_
Tanglewood	_
for	_
many	_
years	_
now	_
.	_

We	_
go	V.02
over	_
about	_
5	_
times	_
a	_
year	_
.	_

We	_
have	V.01
never	_
had	V.03
a	_
problem	_
with	_
the	_
cabins	_
.	_

They	_
are	V.01
always	_
so	_
helpful	V.04
.	_

The	_
cabins	_
have	V.01
always	_
been	V.01
clean	V.04
.	_

Helen	_
is	V.01
a	_
wonderful	_
place	_
to	_
take	V.01
you	_
family	_
.	_

We	_
recommend	V.01
these	_
cabins	_
!	_

Ca	_
n't	_
say	V.01
enough	_

I	_
used	V.03
to	_
tan	V.01
down	_
the	_
street	_
before	_
I	_
was	V.03
referred	V.02
to	_
this	_
place	_
by	_
one	_
of	_
my	_
friends	_
.	_

WOW	_
!	_

I	_
did	V.01
n't	_
know	V.01
what	_
I	_
was	V.03
missing	V.01
.	_

The	_
lowest	_
bed	_
here	_
is	V.01
better	V.02
than	_
my	_
last	_
salon	_
s	_
highest	_
level	_
.	_

Salon	_
is	V.01
clean	V.04
and	_
girls	_
are	V.01
nice	V.01
.	_

Great	_
People	_
and	_
even	_
better	_
service	V.02
!	_

Best	_
to	_
deal	V.01
with	_
!	_

In	_
a	_
few	_
words	_
...	_
I	_
'm	V.01
pleasantly	_
surprised	V.01
that	_
you	_
can	_
still	_
find	V.01
"	_
old	_
school	_
"	_
service	V.01
out	_
there	_
where	_
company	_
care	V.01
more	_
about	_
good	_
name	_
and	_
customers	_
than	_
their	_
pockets	_
...	_

Highly	_
recommended	_
people	_
/	_
business	_

Thanks	V.01

Dentist	_
you	_
can	_
trust	V.02

If	_
possible	_
I	_
try	V.01
the	_
services	V.01
on	_
myself	_
before	_
I	_
bring	V.01
in	_
my	_
son	_
.	_

Drs.	_
Ali	_
work	V.01
wonders	V.02

Neither	_
me	_
nor	_
my	_
son	_
have	V.01
n't	_
had	V.03
a	_
single	_
cavity	_
since	_
we	_
started	V.01
dental	_
care	V.03
there	_
.	_

The	_
team	_
focus	_
is	V.01
prevention	V.01
and	_
education	V.01
.	_

That	_
alone	_
makes	V.02
them	_
unique	V.01
.	_

This	_
is	V.01
not	_
your	_
usual	_
cheap	_
hotdog	_
place	_
.	_

They	_
offer	V.01
a	_
large	_
variety	_
of	_
quality	_
hotdogs	_
and	_
hamburgers	_
They	_
also	_
offer	V.01
veggie	_
dogs	_
.	_

The	_
fries	_
are	V.01
of	_
good	_
quality	_
,	_
the	_
staff	_
is	V.01
friendly	V.01
.	_

The	_
atmosphere	_
is	V.01
your	_
typical	_
indie	_
outfit	_
with	_
old	_
movie	_
posters	_
and	_
memorabilia	_
from	_
the	_
70's	_
and	_
80's	_
.	_

Over	_
charged	V.01
.	_

I	_
used	V.01
my	_
card	_
to	_
purchase	V.01
a	_
meal	_
on	_
the	_
menu	_
and	_
the	_
total	_
on	_
my	_
receipt	_
was	V.01
$	_
8.95	_
but	_
when	_
I	_
went	V.02
on	_
line	_
to	_
check	V.01
my	_
transaction	V.01
it	_
show	V.01
$	_
10.74	_

There	_
is	V.02
something	_
wrong	_
or	_
maybe	_
the	_
individual	_
made	V.LV
a	_
mistake	V.02
but	_
to	_
me	_
that	_
is	V.01
not	_
integrity	_
.	_

Elmira	_

All	_
I	_

the	_
seamstress	_
done	V.08
a	_
perfect	_
job	_
until	_
i	_
met	V.02

I	_
recommend	V.01
you	_
to	_
everyone	_
in	_
Calgary	_
,	_
as	_
she	_
is	V.01
a	_
professional	_
